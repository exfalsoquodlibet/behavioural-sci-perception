       "      <td>Dominic Cummings started 2020 with a job ad containing an eccentric set of skills for shaking up government forecasting and decision-making. Is this pure disruption, or do those topics and technologies offer a clue to his plans?The keywords lay a very specific trail of breadcrumbs. Prediction science, cognitive technologies, Cialdini, Pearl's calculus of causation. Agent-based models, storytelling, the Neo4j database his programmers will use. What could this collection of buzzwords mean?I have a pretty good idea, because the expertise Dom wants is a near-perfect description of my work. But I'm unlikely to apply.For a decade I've used exactly this combination of mathematical, economic and computing disciplines to model the economy and the human imagination, giving me a distinctive insight into what Cummings might be up to. I believe he has two ambitious plans - but a critical third step is missing.The first is advanced data science. Finding cause-and-effect levers in huge datasets; approximating when perfect decisions aren't possible. Programming languages, machine learning: essential tools of modern life. Nothing wrong with the civil service getting better at that.The second step is less neutral. Agent-based models are a tool (which I endorse) for running computer simulations of society and testing new policies. Behavioural economics and persuasion technology can sell ideas to a sceptical population: this is what made Cummings famous.But ten years of doing this has taught me a third component is indispensable. It's absent from Silicon Valley's move-fast-break-things philosophy, and from Dom's blog post. The third element is values.For humans, values are our motivation to solve problems and a measure of whether we've succeeded. AI has motivations too. Nudge theory says 'there is no neutral choice architecture', and there is no neutral goal for an algorithm. If you don't give it values, it will inherit them by default.Programmers and economists (I've been both) prefer simple values. The greatest happiness for the greatest number: the perfect algorithmic principle? Until you start to ask: are UK-resident, taxpaying EU nationals included in \"the greatest number\", or only British citizens? If someone needs £30,000 for mobility support or cancer treatment, how is that weighed against the 30 people who'll give up £1,000 to provide it?Until we give values to machines, they can't apply the good judgement that is essential to policy design.Traditional economics seeks the best way for people to get what they want. Dom's ideas will optimise that process. The next step needs cognitive economics: the study of how our brains decide what we want, before we ask how to get it. We are just starting to answer that for humans, let alone AI.To give values to algorithms, we must agree on those values. That means democratic debate, not civil service rules. Only then can we let AI loose on running the country. Policy is not just an optimisation problem, it's a set of choices about the society we want to live in. And until Cummings - and his boss - have shown us what their values are, I'm not ready to help implement them.

       "0  Dominic Cummings started 2020 with a job ad containing an eccentric set of skills for shaking up government forecasting and decision-making. Is this pure disruption, or do those topics and technologies offer a clue to his plans?The keywords lay a very specific trail of breadcrumbs. Prediction science, cognitive technologies, Cialdini, Pearl's calculus of causation. Agent-based models, storytelling, the Neo4j database his programmers will use. What could this collection of buzzwords mean?I have a pretty good idea, because the expertise Dom wants is a near-perfect description of my work. But I'm unlikely to apply.For a decade I've used exactly this combination of mathematical, economic and computing disciplines to model the economy and the human imagination, giving me a distinctive insight into what Cummings might be up to. I believe he has two ambitious plans - but a critical third step is missing.The first is advanced data science. Finding cause-and-effect levers in huge datasets; approximating when perfect decisions aren't possible. Programming languages, machine learning: essential tools of modern life. Nothing wrong with the civil service getting better at that.The second step is less neutral. Agent-based models are a tool (which I endorse) for running computer simulations of society and testing new policies. Behavioural economics and persuasion technology can sell ideas to a sceptical population: this is what made Cummings famous.But ten years of doing this has taught me a third component is indispensable. It's absent from Silicon Valley's move-fast-break-things philosophy, and from Dom's blog post. The third element is values.For humans, values are our motivation to solve problems and a measure of whether we've succeeded. AI has motivations too. Nudge theory says 'there is no neutral choice architecture', and there is no neutral goal for an algorithm. If you don't give it values, it will inherit them by default.Programmers and economists (I've been both) prefer simple values. The greatest happiness for the greatest number: the perfect algorithmic principle? Until you start to ask: are UK-resident, taxpaying EU nationals included in \"the greatest number\", or only British citizens? If someone needs £30,000 for mobility support or cancer treatment, how is that weighed against the 30 people who'll give up £1,000 to provide it?Until we give values to machines, they can't apply the good judgement that is essential to policy design.Traditional economics seeks the best way for people to get what they want. Dom's ideas will optimise that process. The next step needs cognitive economics: the study of how our brains decide what we want, before we ask how to get it. We are just starting to answer that for humans, let alone AI.To give values to algorithms, we must agree on those values. That means democratic debate, not civil service rules. Only then can we let AI loose on running the country. Policy is not just an optimisation problem, it's a set of choices about the society we want to live in. And until Cummings - and his boss - have shown us what their values are, I'm not ready to help implement them.
