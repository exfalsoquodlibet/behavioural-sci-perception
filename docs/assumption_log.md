## Twitter data acquisition

We did not further filter the tweets to only include those that were geotagged as that 
would have resulted in less than 150 tweets (out of ~14,000), the only ones with geotagging information. 

This means that we will not be able to do any analysis broken down by location (e.g., UK vs US).

We minimise the risk of including tweets generated in the USA by only filtering for the British
spelling of words (e.g. "behavioural" but NOT "behavioral") when this was an option.
