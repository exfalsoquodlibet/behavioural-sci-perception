## Twitter data acquisition

We did not further filter the tweets to only include those that were geotagged as that 
would have resulted in less than 200 tweets (out of 14,020), the only ones with geotagging information. 

This means that we will not be able to do any analysis broken down my location (e.g., UK vs US).
