The copycat tactics are not limited to healthy eating habits - junk food consumption increased by a third if people believed their friends were also indulging. Researchers warned that the approval from our friends who are chomping down on unhealthy foods may give us a dangerous 'licence to eat'. Normally it's social media stars that are thought to sway our diet. But this study suggests our influences are closer to home. The researchers from Aston University, Birmingham, said the findings could be useful for tackling bad eating habits in children using social media. Study leader Lily Hawkins, a PhD student in health psychology, said: 'This study suggests we may be influenced by our social peers more than we realise when choosing certain foods.'We seem to be subconsciously accounting for how others behave when making our own food choices.'So if we believe our friends are eating plenty of fruit and veg we're more likely to eat fruit and veg ourselves.'On the other hand, if we feel they're happy to consume lots of snacks and sugary drinks, it can give us a ""licence to overeat"" foods that are bad for our health.'The implication is that we can use social media as a tool to ""nudge"" each other's eating behaviour within friendship groups, and potentially use this knowledge as a tool for public health interventions.'                     ARE YOUR FRIENDS MAKING YOU FATTER?                    Your social circle may be the reason you are overweight, a study in March 2019 suggested.Experts warned that obesity can spread through communities like a 'social contagion'.Researchers studied hundreds of military families - who can't choose where they live - across the US.Their results revealed if you move to an area with a high rate of obesity, it increases your risk of becoming obese, too.For every percentage-point increase in the local obesity rate, the chances a person would be overweight or obese increased by up to six per cent.The risk of the parent becoming obese or overweight went up by five per cent for every single percentage increase of obesity in the area. The longer the families lived there, the more likely they were to see the weight pile on.The University of Southern California researchers said people adopt behaviours of others subconsciously. One possibility is that people with similar interests and backgrounds tend to locate in similar areas. Another explanation may be people are all influenced by the shared environment, such as opportunities for exercising and healthy eating.A third explanation may be that obesity is transmitted through social influence.In the study, published in the scientific journal Appetite, the researchers asked 369 university students to estimate the amount of fruit, veg, 'calorie-dense snacks' and sugary drinks their Facebook friends ate on a daily basis.This information was cross-referenced with the participants' own eating habits and showed that those who felt their social circles 'approved' of eating junk food consumed significantly more themselves.Meanwhile those who thought their friends ate a healthy diet ate more portions of fruit and veg. Their perceptions could have come from seeing friends' posts about the food and drink they consumed, or simply a general impression of their overall health.Scientists note that the study showed no significant link between people's eating habits and their Body Mass Index (BMI).They are now looking to track a group over time to see whether the influence of social media on eating habits has longer-term impact on weight. The most recent figures from the NHS's Health Survey for England showed that, in 2018, only 28 per cent of adults were eating the recommended five portions of fruit and vegetables per day. Aisling Pigott, a registered dietitian and spokesperson for the British Dietetic Association, said: 'Research such as this demonstrates how we are influenced by online perceptions about how others eat.'The promotion of positive health messages across social media, which are focused on promoting healthy choices and non-restrictive relationships with food and body, could nudge people into making positive decisions around the food they eat.'We do have to be mindful of the importance of 'nudging' positive behaviours and not 'shaming' food choices on social media as a health intervention.'We know that generating guilt around food is not particularly helpful when it comes to lifestyle change and maintenance.'Professor Claire Farrow, Director of Aston University's Applied Health Research Group, added: 'The important new findings from this study could help shape how we deliver interventions that help them [young people] adopt healthy eating habits from a young age - and stick with them for life.'

78,78,Chelsea player tests positive for coronavirus just hours after Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta was diagnosed - throwing football season into CHAOS following Premier League decision to go ahead with all fixtures and PM's refusal to ban mass gatherings,"March 12, 2020 Thursday","•Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta has revealed that he has tested positive for the deadly COVID-19 disease•He and the entire Arsenal first-team squad and coaching staff will be in self-isolating as a precaution•Diagnosis came less than an hour after Premier League announced this weekend's fixtures will go ahead•Chelsea midfielder Callum Hudson-Odoi also tested positive for the disease as future fixtures placed in doubt•UK officially went into 'delay' phase of coronavirus plan advising anyone with a cough or a fever to self-isolate•But Boris Johnson refused to ban mass gatherings or shut schools despite warning the crisis would get worse•The coronavirus was officially declared as a pandemic by the World Health Organisation on Wednesday                     Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta and Chelsea player Callum Hudson-Odoi have both tested positive for coronavirus just hours after the Premier League announced this weekend's fixtures will still go ahead.Arteta, 37, became the first confirmed member of staff of a Premier League team to contract the disease, which was officially labelled a pandemic by the World Health Organisation on Wednesday.News of Arteta's diagnosis came less than an hour after the Premier League announced that this weekend's fixtures would still be played as planned. He, and the entire first-team squad and coaching staff, will now be self-isolating in accordance with the most recent government guidelines.Chelsea announced Hudson-Odoi, 19, had tested positive with COVID-19 at around midnight and said the training facility in Cobham, Surrey, will be partially closed.Chelsea staff who had recent close contact with the winger will also self-isolate, the club said in a statement. The player posted a video on Twitter this morning (Friday), thanking fans for their good wishes and confirming he will be self isolating.He said: 'As you may be aware I had the virus for the last couple of days which I have recovered from. I'm following the health guidelines and self-isolating myself from everybody for the week. Hope to see everybody soon and hopefully be back on the pitch very soon.'The Premier League will hold an emergency meeting via conference call at 10.30am on Friday to decide if and how to proceed with the remaining fixtures of the season.Earlier today Prime Minister Boris Johnson chaired a meeting of Cobra emergency committee in which he refused to ban mass gatherings or shut schools despite saying 'many loved ones' will die during the escalating crisis. Arsenal were due to play Brighton on Saturday, but the South Coast club announced this evening that the match is postponed. . It is understood Arteta did not come into contact with Olympiakos owner Evangelos Marinakis, who also tested positive, during their Europa League game on February 27. There are over 590 confirmed cases of the virus in the UK, and 10 people have died from it so far. Nearly 5,000 people have died worldwide, and the number of cases has shot up to over 130,000.The prime minister today branded the virus the 'worst public health crisis in a generation' and warned that 'many more' people are going to die, but still held off drastic measures. At a press conference in Westminster, Mr Johnson formally declared that the UK's tactics have shifted from 'containing' the killer disease to merely 'delaying' its inevitable spread, after he chaired a meeting of the Cobra emergency committee. Mr Johnson said it was clear the disease will continue to spread around the world and people should brace for the 'reality' of 'severe disruption' for many months. The Government's new plan urges anyone with even mild coronavirus-like symptoms - a persistent cough or a fever - to quarantine themselves at home and to sleep alone if possible and stay at least two metres from relatives.The PM has also recommended all overseas school trips be cancelled while people over the age of 70 or those with pre-existing serious medical conditions have been told not to go on cruises.But he stopped short of more extreme measures such as closing schools and banning mass gatherings which have been adopted in Ireland, Norway, France and Italy in an effort to stem the spread of the virus.Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said this evening that Scotland was shutting down public events 'that have the potential to have an impact on our frontline emergency services'. Mr Johnson said the UK would not close schools yet even though government advisers admitted the move would help stem the outbreak. Advisers said the length of closure necessary to make the measure work could be more than 16 weeks and would at this stage therefore not be feasible. Chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance also said today he believed the true number of infections was likely to be 5,000-10,000 already. He estimated that the UK was four weeks behind the trajectory of the crisis in Italy - which has brought the country to its knees.The peak of the outbreak in the UK might not come for 10 to 14 weeks, the experts said - suggesting it will run into June. As a result of their manager's diagnosis, Arsenal's upcoming fixtures look unlikely to go ahead. The club is now attempting to track down anyone who has had close contact with Arteta in recent times. It is widely expected that Chelsea's next two games against Aston Villa on Saturday and Bayern Munich on Wednesday in the Champions League will no longer go ahead.The game in Germany was set to go ahead behind closed doors but Hudson-Odoi's diagnosis has thrown any chance of fulfilling that game next week in serious doubt. A spokesperson for the club said the teenage midfielder became unwell and had the symptoms of a 'mild cold' and hoped their staff will be back to work soon. The statement said: 'Chelsea men's team player Callum Hudson-Odoi had a positive test result for Coronavirus returned this evening [Thursday]. 'Chelsea personnel who had recent close contact with the player in the men's team building will now self-isolate in line with Government health guidelines. These will include initially the full men's team squad, coaching staff and a number of backroom staff.'It is expected that those who did not have close contact with Callum will return to work in the coming days. In the meantime, the men's team building, one of several separate buildings at our training ground, will remain closed. The rest of our training facility, Stamford Bridge and our other facilities are operating as normal.'Callum displayed symptoms similar to a mild cold on Monday morning and has not been at the training ground since then as a precaution. However, his test came in positive this evening and he will undergo a period of self-isolation. Despite testing positive for the virus, Callum is doing well and looking forward to returning to the training ground as soon as it is possible.'If Arsenal now cannot fulfil their fixtures in the next two weeks because their players are self-isolation, that also puts their FA Cup quarter-final with Sheffield United on March 22 at risk. Arsenal said in a statement: 'It is clear we will not be able to play some fixtures on their currently scheduled dates. We will update supporters who have tickets for forthcoming games with more information as soon as possible.' Arsenal's under-23 game on Friday against Tottenham, plus their under-18 against Reading and under-16 against Boreham Wood on Saturday will all be postponed, the club said. One proposal in Friday's Premier League meeting, which will be held as a conference call in the morning, will be to postpone all games until the international break later this month when they could be rescheduled. It could also see all the remaining Premier League fixtures played behind closed doors.Arsenal played Olympiacos in the Europa League a couple of weeks ago, and since then the Greek club's owner Evangelos Marinakis has tested positive for the virus. Wolves' match against Olympiacos on Thursday evening was played behind closed doors as a precaution. Most of Europe's top leagues have either suspended matches or will play games with no crowd until further notice. Arsenal have closed down the London Colney training centre after the manager received a postitive COVIC-19 result on Thursday evening. First team players participated in a training session there on Tuesday afternoon.

Both training centres will undergo a deep clean.Anyone who has not come into close contact with Arteta is expected to return to work within the next few days. Arteta said: 'This is really disappointing but I took the test after feeling poorly. I will be at work as soon as I'm allowed.' The news came less than an hour after the Premier League announced that this weekend's fixtures would be going ahead as planned. However, in the light of this development, the Premier League will now be holding an emergency meeting on Friday morning regarding future fixtures. A statement said: 'In light of Arsenal's announcement tonight confirming that their first-team coach Mikel Arteta has tested positive for COVID-19, the Premier League will convene an emergency club meeting tomorrow morning regarding future fixtures.'The Premier League will make no further comment until after that meeting.' Over the past week, Arsenal have played against Portsmouth in the FA Cup, and West Ham in the Premier League. Handshakes were banned for the Premier League match, however Arteta still came into physical contact with a number of people during the game. He fist bumped Bukayo Saka at full-time, and also embraced assistant manager Albert Stuivenberg, after hugging rival manager David Moyes before the game.Juventus revealed on Thursday that 121 people, including players, directors, and staff are now in self-isolation after defender Daniele Rugani tested positive for coronavirus. Sampdoria striker Manolo Gabbiadini has also tested positive, with Italy one of the worst-hit countries. Three Leicester players are in self-isolation and Chelsea have cancelled a training session in order to deep clean their own facility. Manchester City defender Benjamin Mendy is also in self-isolation after one of his family members tested positive. Real Madrid's match against Manchester City in the Champions League has been called off as the entire club has gone into a 15-day quarantine amid the crisis. On an unprecedented day of cancellations football league programmes in Spain, Portugal, Holland and the United States were suspended alongside postponements in rugby, tennis, golf, basketball and athletics, while England's Test series in Sri Lanka that is due to start next week came under threat and more doubts were raised over whether this summer's European Championship and Olympics will take place as planned. Will it be enough? Boris Johnson says 'MANY loved ones' will die and tells people to stay home if they have a COUGH as he brands coronavirus 'worst health crisis in a generation'... but still refuses to ban mass gatherings or shut schools                                           Boris Johnson today branded coronavirus the 'worst public health crisis in a generation' and warned that 'many more' people are going to die - but still held off drastic measures.

'At all stages we have been guided by the science. We will do the right thing at the right time,' Mr Johnson said. The number of UK cases has risen by 130 and the death toll hit 10 in the last 24 hours, with experts increasingly bracing for turmoil as the overwhelming majority of the population becomes infected and the country develops 'herd immunity'. But chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance said he believed the true number of infections was likely to be 5,000-10,000 already. He estimated that the UK was four weeks behind the trajectory of the crisis in Italy - which has brought the country to its knees.The peak of the outbreak in the UK might not come for 10-14 weeks, the experts said - suggesting it will run into June. Mr Johnson insisted comparisons to seasonal flu were wrong. 'This is more dangerous and it's going to spread further. And I must level with you and the British public: more families, many more families, are going to lose loved ones before their time,' he said. Despite the bloodcurdling warnings, Mr Johnson said the UK would not close schools yet even though government advisers admitted the move would help stem the outbreak. Advisers said the length of closure necessary to make the measure work could be more than 16 weeks and would at this stage therefore not be feasible. Chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance said it was not realistic to expect children to be cooped up that long. He said: 'It is true that there is some effect in closing schools but that effect is minimal and actually you would have to do it for 13 to 16 weeks or longer.'You do not have to be a very advanced mathematician to work out that the chances of keeping children not speaking to each other or playing with each other are zero.'Closing down schools could also put elderly grandparents at risk if they were asked to look after children, who are believed to be less susceptible to the most severe form of the disease but can still spread it.'The scientific advice is that this could do more harm than good,' Mr Johnson said. 'But we are keeping this under review and this could change as the disease spreads. Schools should only close if they are specifically advised to do so.'Mr Johnson conceded that Scotland was already banning mass gatherings, but suggested there was a 'particular issue with the resilience of their public services' north of the border, in a perceived swipe at Nicola Sturgeon after she undermined him by announcing her plans first.

'We are not saying no to that sort of measures, of course not,' Mr Johnson said. 'We are keeping it up our sleeves. But it is very important... that we get the timing right.' Chief medical officer Prof Chris Whitty added: 'We need to do it at the last point it is reasonable so people maintain their energy and enthusiasm... it is important we do not ask our fellow citizens to do it for longer than makes sense.' The FTSE plunged by more than 10 per cent today in response to the dramatic US announcement of a travel ban from Europe overnight, and growing global chaos. And in the latest high-profile victim of the outbreak, BT's chief executive, Philip Jansen, tested positive for COVID-19 on Thursday.'Having felt slightly unwell I decided as a precaution to be tested. As soon as the test results were known I isolated myself at home,' Jansen said in a statement. 'I've met several industry partners this week so felt it was the responsible thing to do to alert them to this fact as soon as I could.'Jansen said his symptoms seemed mild and he would work remotely over the coming week, avoiding disruption to the business of Britain's biggest telecoms group. The UK approach is increasingly at odds with that of other countries, with Ireland joining the list of those closing all schools and colleges and banning mass gatherings. In the first sign of splits within the UK, Nicola Sturgeon has declared that Scotland will also cancelling events with more than 500 people from the start of next week, saying that they take up too much time for emergency services.She admitted: 'These are not easy judgements. They are difficult and complicated.'The government has also made clear it will not follow Donald Trump's dramatic overnight move of closing the borders to travellers from mainland Europe. Instead Mr Johnson seems determined to take a limited response, asking those with a cold to self-quarantine, and urge vulnerable elderly people to stay indoors.Former Cabinet minister Rory Stewart this afternoon accused the PM of 'smug insular complacency, warning that without quick action there could be 100,000 cases in the UK within the next 24 days.'This is at risk of becoming an example of smug insular complacency - refusing to pay any attention to what any other country is doing or the successful public health approach in Asia,' the London Mayor hopeful said. 'We should show some humility, learn from others and act now.' Ms Sturgeon said this evening that Scotland was shutting down public events 'that have the potential to have an impact on our frontline emergency services'.'This is not a move that we are making because the science has told us it will have a significant impact on the spread of the virus: on the contrary, the scientists tell us it will not have a significant impact on the spread of the virus - although no significant impact does not equate to no impact at all,' she said.'But there are wider reasons that I consider and have judged that are important in reaching this decision.'                     Early lockdown 'can cut coronavirus infections'                    Shocking charts show how the UK Government could prevent hundreds or even thousands of deaths by taking dramatic action now to fight the killer coronavirus and 'flatten the curve' of its spiralling epidemic.Prime Minister Boris Johnson today decided not to move forward in Britain's fight against COVID-19, declining to close schools, send people home from work or ban large gatherings.But he is coming under intense scrutiny for refusing to budge - one frustrated scientist warned: 'Now is the time for the UK government to ban large gatherings, ask people to stop non-essential travel, recommend employers shift to home working and ramp up the response.'Official advice currently doesn't go much further than telling citizens to wash their hands even though the UK now has more cases than China did when Wuhan's 11million people were forced into lockdown.Scientists and critics are urging the Government to do more to prolong an inevitable surge in cases, saying that a spike of infections could cripple the NHS but spreading the cases over a longer period of time would 'flatten the curve' and make it easier for the nation to cope. An analysis of statistics has shown that areas that acted fast have slashed their death rates by up to eight times compared to those who react after the virus has taken hold.In South Korea, for example, an area home to 2.5million people was put into lockdown when just 204 people had been diagnosed and one had died. The country now has a death rate of just 0.8 per cent despite more than 7,800 cases.But in Italy, large-scale lockdowns were not brought in until Sunday, March 8, by which time it had more than 5,800 patients. There are now almost 12,500 and 827 deaths - a death rate of 6.6 per cent. 'Certain events, whether or not they need dedicated ambulance cover, we know that certain events have an impact on our policing and our front-line health services, accident and emergency and ambulance services.'At a time when pressure on those services is going to be considerable ... it is incumbent on government to do what we can to remove unnecessary burdens on our public services.'The decision is set to come into force the day after Rangers host Celtic in one of this weekend's Ladbrokes Premiership fixtures, with the champions currently 13 points clear of their rivals.Prof Whitty said the UK would not be introducing social distancing measures yet as it was not the right moment within the pandemic.But he warned that advice would be coming for elderly and vulnerable people to isolate themselves from social gatherings.He said: 'The next stage along we are going to want to do a package of things that are about putting social distancing around the people who are older and those with severe health conditions.'But we do not think it is appropriate to make a national recommendation for that at the moment because it is too early in the course of the epidemic.'If you think about what would happen if you prematurely put elderly or vulnerable in a situation where you're saying, we really want to cut down on your social interactions, to cut back on your contact with others, it has big practical implications for them and may lead to loneliness and other issues which are clearly very undesirable for them.'While we will need to move to that stage, we do not think this is the right moment along the pandemic to do so. But that point will come.'Eariler, Mr Johnson swiped at political leaders who do not 'follow the science'. In comments made before Mr Trump's announcement, he said many leaders were 'under a lot of pressure to be seen to act'. Asked whether the PM knew of Mr Trump's escalation in advance, Downing Street said today: 'UK and US officials are in regular contact.' To fight what is now officially a global pandemic, the Budget handed hospitals a £5billion fighting fund while thousands of firms will be given a business rates holiday to help avert the risk of bankruptcy.Sick pay will be reformed to ensure that employees are not penalised for going into quarantine. In a round of interviews today, Mr Sunak told the BBC: 'I make absolutely no apology for responding in the short term in scale to the immediate threat that we face from coronavirus. 'I think that's the right thing to do for the economy, we need to help businesses have a bridge to get to the other side.'His package came as the Bank of England's base rate was slashed to an historic low of just 0.25 per cent.Mr Johnson will confirm today that the UK is switching from a strategy of trying to contain the outbreak to one of trying to delay its worst effects in order to give the NHS more time to cope. The Prime Minister - one of whose Cabinet ministers went into self-isolation last night along with five other MPs - is also likely to announce a range of social-distancing measures.However, the government is not expected to go as far as Donald Trump, who yesterday told Americans he was ordering an immediate shut-down of all travel from Europe. Irish PM Leo Varadkar has declared that schools, colleges and childcare facilities are to close for two weeks.He made a live statement to the nation from Washington DC, where he is due to meet Mr Trump later as part of the annual St Patrick's Day programme of events.

'Unfortunately we must face the tragic reality that some people will die,' he said.Mr Varadkar said he was acting on fresh advice from the country's National Public Health Emergency Team.'The virus is all over the world, it will continue to spread but it can be slowed,' he said. Dr David Halpern, head of the UK's Behavioural Insights Team dubbed Britain's 'Nudge Unit' who reports directly to Mr Johnson, has suggested the 500,000 people in UK care homes or with respiratory conditions could be the only people protected.He has suggested the virus can be beaten by letting it spread through healthy people to kill it off rather than a nationwide lockdown that could allow coronavirus to rise again later in the year.Dr Halpern has revealed ministers are considering a policy of keeping high-risk groups such as the elderly or those with underlying health conditions isolated in care homes or in their own homes over the coming months.He said: 'There's going to be a point, assuming the epidemic flows and grows as it will do, where you want to cocoon, to protect those at-risk groups so they don't catch the disease.'By the time they come out of their cocooning, herd immunity has been achieved in the rest of the population'.  Deputy chief medical officer Jenny Harries was asked on the BBC if 'pretty much everyone will get it eventually'.Speaking hours after world health officials declared the coronavirus a pandemic, Trump repeatedly defended his own actions and vowed the nation would prevail in countering the virus and getting treatment on the market.'We will be suspending all travel from Europe to the United States for the next 30 days,' Trump announced, in a speech from the Oval Office to the nation. 'The new rules will go into effect Friday at midnight,' he said. The move was so sudden the acting Homeland Security secretary said he would issue full guidance on how to carry it out within 48 hours.The White House said the travel restrictions would apply to foreign nationals who have visited 26 European countries - but excluding the UK and Ireland - in the past 14 days. It will not apply to US citizens, their 'immediate' family members or legal permanent residents. But confusion remained over how exactly the rules would apply and in what time zone the deadline would be introduced. Chancellor Rishi Sunak today said the UK was not following the US example.'The advice we are getting is that there is not evidence that interventions like closing borders or travel bans are going to have a material effect on the spread of the infections,' he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.

He, and the entire first-team squad and coaching staff, will now be self-isolating in accordance with the most recent government guidelines.Chelsea announced Hudson-Odoi, 19, had tested positive with COVID-19 at around midnight and said the training facility in Cobham, Surrey, will be partially closed.Chelsea staff who had recent close contact with the winger will also self-isolate, the club said in a statement. The player posted a video on Twitter this morning (Friday), thanking fans for their good wishes and confirming he will be self isolating.He said: 'As you may be aware I had the virus for the last couple of days which I have recovered from. I'm following the health guidelines and self-isolating myself from everybody for the week. Hope to see everybody soon and hopefully be back on the pitch very soon.'The Premier League will hold an emergency meeting via conference call at 10.30am on Friday to decide if and how to proceed with the remaining fixtures of the season.Earlier today Prime Minister Boris Johnson chaired a meeting of Cobra emergency committee in which he refused to ban mass gatherings or shut schools despite saying 'many loved ones' will die during the escalating crisis. Arsenal were due to play Brighton on Saturday, but the South Coast club announced this evening that the match is postponed. . It is understood Arteta did not come into contact with Olympiakos owner Evangelos Marinakis, who also tested positive, during their Europa League game on February 27. There are over 590 confirmed cases of the virus in the UK, and 10 people have died from it so far. Nearly 5,000 people have died worldwide, and the number of cases has shot up to over 130,000.The prime minister today branded the virus the 'worst public health crisis in a generation' and warned that 'many more' people are going to die, but still held off drastic measures. At a press conference in Westminster, Mr Johnson formally declared that the UK's tactics have shifted from 'containing' the killer disease to merely 'delaying' its inevitable spread, after he chaired a meeting of the Cobra emergency committee. Mr Johnson said it was clear the disease will continue to spread around the world and people should brace for the 'reality' of 'severe disruption' for many months. The Government's new plan urges anyone with even mild coronavirus-like symptoms - a persistent cough or a fever - to quarantine themselves at home and to sleep alone if possible and stay at least two metres from relatives.The PM has also recommended all overseas school trips be cancelled while people over the age of 70 or those with pre-existing serious medical conditions have been told not to go on cruises.But he stopped short of more extreme measures such as closing schools and banning mass gatherings which have been adopted in Ireland, Norway, France and Italy in an effort to stem the spread of the virus.Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said this evening that Scotland was shutting down public events 'that have the potential to have an impact on our frontline emergency services'. Mr Johnson said the UK would not close schools yet even though government advisers admitted the move would help stem the outbreak. Advisers said the length of closure necessary to make the measure work could be more than 16 weeks and would at this stage therefore not be feasible. Chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance also said today he believed the true number of infections was likely to be 5,000-10,000 already. He estimated that the UK was four weeks behind the trajectory of the crisis in Italy - which has brought the country to its knees.The peak of the outbreak in the UK might not come for 10 to 14 weeks, the experts said - suggesting it will run into June. As a result of their manager's diagnosis, Arsenal's upcoming fixtures look unlikely to go ahead. The club is now attempting to track down anyone who has had close contact with Arteta in recent times. It is widely expected that Chelsea's next two games against Aston Villa on Saturday and Bayern Munich on Wednesday in the Champions League will no longer go ahead.The game in Germany was set to go ahead behind closed doors but Hudson-Odoi's diagnosis has thrown any chance of fulfilling that game next week in serious doubt. A spokesperson for the club said the teenage midfielder became unwell and had the symptoms of a 'mild cold' and hoped their staff will be back to work soon. The statement said: 'Chelsea men's team player Callum Hudson-Odoi had a positive test result for Coronavirus returned this evening [Thursday]. 'Chelsea personnel who had recent close contact with the player in the men's team building will now self-isolate in line with Government health guidelines. These will include initially the full men's team squad, coaching staff and a number of backroom staff.'It is expected that those who did not have close contact with Callum will return to work in the coming days. In the meantime, the men's team building, one of several separate buildings at our training ground, will remain closed. The rest of our training facility, Stamford Bridge and our other facilities are operating as normal.'Callum displayed symptoms similar to a mild cold on Monday morning and has not been at the training ground since then as a precaution. However, his test came in positive this evening and he will undergo a period of self-isolation. Despite testing positive for the virus, Callum is doing well and looking forward to returning to the training ground as soon as it is possible.'If Arsenal now cannot fulfil their fixtures in the next two weeks because their players are self-isolation, that also puts their FA Cup quarter-final with Sheffield United on March 22 at risk. Arsenal said in a statement: 'It is clear we will not be able to play some fixtures on their currently scheduled dates. We will update supporters who have tickets for forthcoming games with more information as soon as possible.' Arsenal's under-23 game on Friday against Tottenham, plus their under-18 against Reading and under-16 against Boreham Wood on Saturday will all be postponed, the club said. One proposal in Friday's Premier League meeting, which will be held as a conference call in the morning, will be to postpone all games until the international break later this month when they could be rescheduled. It could also see all the remaining Premier League fixtures played behind closed doors.Arsenal played Olympiacos in the Europa League a couple of weeks ago, and since then the Greek club's owner Evangelos Marinakis has tested positive for the virus. Wolves' match against Olympiacos on Thursday evening was played behind closed doors as a precaution. Most of Europe's top leagues have either suspended matches or will play games with no crowd until further notice. Arsenal have closed down the London Colney training centre after the manager received a postitive COVIC-19 result on Thursday evening. First team players participated in a training session there on Tuesday afternoon.

Both training centres will undergo a deep clean.Anyone who has not come into close contact with Arteta is expected to return to work within the next few days. Arteta said: 'This is really disappointing but I took the test after feeling poorly. I will be at work as soon as I'm allowed.' The news came less than an hour after the Premier League announced that this weekend's fixtures would be going ahead as planned. However, in the light of this development, the Premier League will now be holding an emergency meeting on Friday morning regarding future fixtures. A statement said: 'In light of Arsenal's announcement tonight confirming that their first-team coach Mikel Arteta has tested positive for COVID-19, the Premier League will convene an emergency club meeting tomorrow morning regarding future fixtures.'The Premier League will make no further comment until after that meeting.' Over the past week, Arsenal have played against Portsmouth in the FA Cup, and West Ham in the Premier League. Handshakes were banned for the Premier League match, however Arteta still came into physical contact with a number of people during the game. He fist bumped Bukayo Saka at full-time, and also embraced assistant manager Albert Stuivenberg, after hugging rival manager David Moyes before the game.Juventus revealed on Thursday that 121 people, including players, directors, and staff are now in self-isolation after defender Daniele Rugani tested positive for coronavirus. Sampdoria striker Manolo Gabbiadini has also tested positive, with Italy one of the worst-hit countries. Three Leicester players are in self-isolation and Chelsea have cancelled a training session in order to deep clean their own facility. Manchester City defender Benjamin Mendy is also in self-isolation after one of his family members tested positive. Real Madrid's match against Manchester City in the Champions League has been called off as the entire club has gone into a 15-day quarantine amid the crisis. On an unprecedented day of cancellations football league programmes in Spain, Portugal, Holland and the United States were suspended alongside postponements in rugby, tennis, golf, basketball and athletics, while England's Test series in Sri Lanka that is due to start next week came under threat and more doubts were raised over whether this summer's European Championship and Olympics will take place as planned. Will it be enough? Boris Johnson says 'MANY loved ones' will die and tells people to stay home if they have a COUGH as he brands coronavirus 'worst health crisis in a generation'... but still refuses to ban mass gatherings or shut schools                                           Boris Johnson today branded coronavirus the 'worst public health crisis in a generation' and warned that 'many more' people are going to die - but still held off drastic measures.

'At all stages we have been guided by the science. We will do the right thing at the right time,' Mr Johnson said. The number of UK cases has risen by 130 and the death toll hit 10 in the last 24 hours, with experts increasingly bracing for turmoil as the overwhelming majority of the population becomes infected and the country develops 'herd immunity'. But chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance said he believed the true number of infections was likely to be 5,000-10,000 already. He estimated that the UK was four weeks behind the trajectory of the crisis in Italy - which has brought the country to its knees.The peak of the outbreak in the UK might not come for 10-14 weeks, the experts said - suggesting it will run into June. Mr Johnson insisted comparisons to seasonal flu were wrong. 'This is more dangerous and it's going to spread further. And I must level with you and the British public: more families, many more families, are going to lose loved ones before their time,' he said. Despite the bloodcurdling warnings, Mr Johnson said the UK would not close schools yet even though government advisers admitted the move would help stem the outbreak. Advisers said the length of closure necessary to make the measure work could be more than 16 weeks and would at this stage therefore not be feasible. Chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance said it was not realistic to expect children to be cooped up that long. He said: 'It is true that there is some effect in closing schools but that effect is minimal and actually you would have to do it for 13 to 16 weeks or longer.'You do not have to be a very advanced mathematician to work out that the chances of keeping children not speaking to each other or playing with each other are zero.'Closing down schools could also put elderly grandparents at risk if they were asked to look after children, who are believed to be less susceptible to the most severe form of the disease but can still spread it.'The scientific advice is that this could do more harm than good,' Mr Johnson said. 'But we are keeping this under review and this could change as the disease spreads. Schools should only close if they are specifically advised to do so.'Mr Johnson conceded that Scotland was already banning mass gatherings, but suggested there was a 'particular issue with the resilience of their public services' north of the border, in a perceived swipe at Nicola Sturgeon after she undermined him by announcing her plans first.

'We are not saying no to that sort of measures, of course not,' Mr Johnson said. 'We are keeping it up our sleeves. But it is very important... that we get the timing right.' Chief medical officer Prof Chris Whitty added: 'We need to do it at the last point it is reasonable so people maintain their energy and enthusiasm... it is important we do not ask our fellow citizens to do it for longer than makes sense.' The FTSE plunged by more than 10 per cent today in response to the dramatic US announcement of a travel ban from Europe overnight, and growing global chaos. And in the latest high-profile victim of the outbreak, BT's chief executive, Philip Jansen, tested positive for COVID-19 on Thursday.'Having felt slightly unwell I decided as a precaution to be tested. As soon as the test results were known I isolated myself at home,' Jansen said in a statement. 'I've met several industry partners this week so felt it was the responsible thing to do to alert them to this fact as soon as I could.'Jansen said his symptoms seemed mild and he would work remotely over the coming week, avoiding disruption to the business of Britain's biggest telecoms group. The UK approach is increasingly at odds with that of other countries, with Ireland joining the list of those closing all schools and colleges and banning mass gatherings. In the first sign of splits within the UK, Nicola Sturgeon has declared that Scotland will also cancelling events with more than 500 people from the start of next week, saying that they take up too much time for emergency services.She admitted: 'These are not easy judgements. They are difficult and complicated.'The government has also made clear it will not follow Donald Trump's dramatic overnight move of closing the borders to travellers from mainland Europe. Instead Mr Johnson seems determined to take a limited response, asking those with a cold to self-quarantine, and urge vulnerable elderly people to stay indoors.Former Cabinet minister Rory Stewart this afternoon accused the PM of 'smug insular complacency, warning that without quick action there could be 100,000 cases in the UK within the next 24 days.'This is at risk of becoming an example of smug insular complacency - refusing to pay any attention to what any other country is doing or the successful public health approach in Asia,' the London Mayor hopeful said. 'We should show some humility, learn from others and act now.' Ms Sturgeon said this evening that Scotland was shutting down public events 'that have the potential to have an impact on our frontline emergency services'.'This is not a move that we are making because the science has told us it will have a significant impact on the spread of the virus: on the contrary, the scientists tell us it will not have a significant impact on the spread of the virus - although no significant impact does not equate to no impact at all,' she said.'But there are wider reasons that I consider and have judged that are important in reaching this decision.'                     Early lockdown 'can cut coronavirus infections'                    Shocking charts show how the UK Government could prevent hundreds or even thousands of deaths by taking dramatic action now to fight the killer coronavirus and 'flatten the curve' of its spiralling epidemic.Prime Minister Boris Johnson today decided not to move forward in Britain's fight against COVID-19, declining to close schools, send people home from work or ban large gatherings.But he is coming under intense scrutiny for refusing to budge - one frustrated scientist warned: 'Now is the time for the UK government to ban large gatherings, ask people to stop non-essential travel, recommend employers shift to home working and ramp up the response.'Official advice currently doesn't go much further than telling citizens to wash their hands even though the UK now has more cases than China did when Wuhan's 11million people were forced into lockdown.Scientists and critics are urging the Government to do more to prolong an inevitable surge in cases, saying that a spike of infections could cripple the NHS but spreading the cases over a longer period of time would 'flatten the curve' and make it easier for the nation to cope. An analysis of statistics has shown that areas that acted fast have slashed their death rates by up to eight times compared to those who react after the virus has taken hold.In South Korea, for example, an area home to 2.5million people was put into lockdown when just 204 people had been diagnosed and one had died. The country now has a death rate of just 0.8 per cent despite more than 7,800 cases.But in Italy, large-scale lockdowns were not brought in until Sunday, March 8, by which time it had more than 5,800 patients. There are now almost 12,500 and 827 deaths - a death rate of 6.6 per cent. 'Certain events, whether or not they need dedicated ambulance cover, we know that certain events have an impact on our policing and our front-line health services, accident and emergency and ambulance services.'At a time when pressure on those services is going to be considerable ... it is incumbent on government to do what we can to remove unnecessary burdens on our public services.'The decision is set to come into force the day after Rangers host Celtic in one of this weekend's Ladbrokes Premiership fixtures, with the champions currently 13 points clear of their rivals.Prof Whitty said the UK would not be introducing social distancing measures yet as it was not the right moment within the pandemic.But he warned that advice would be coming for elderly and vulnerable people to isolate themselves from social gatherings.He said: 'The next stage along we are going to want to do a package of things that are about putting social distancing around the people who are older and those with severe health conditions.'But we do not think it is appropriate to make a national recommendation for that at the moment because it is too early in the course of the epidemic.'If you think about what would happen if you prematurely put elderly or vulnerable in a situation where you're saying, we really want to cut down on your social interactions, to cut back on your contact with others, it has big practical implications for them and may lead to loneliness and other issues which are clearly very undesirable for them.'While we will need to move to that stage, we do not think this is the right moment along the pandemic to do so. But that point will come.'Eariler, Mr Johnson swiped at political leaders who do not 'follow the science'. In comments made before Mr Trump's announcement, he said many leaders were 'under a lot of pressure to be seen to act'. Asked whether the PM knew of Mr Trump's escalation in advance, Downing Street said today: 'UK and US officials are in regular contact.' To fight what is now officially a global pandemic, the Budget handed hospitals a £5billion fighting fund while thousands of firms will be given a business rates holiday to help avert the risk of bankruptcy.Sick pay will be reformed to ensure that employees are not penalised for going into quarantine. In a round of interviews today, Mr Sunak told the BBC: 'I make absolutely no apology for responding in the short term in scale to the immediate threat that we face from coronavirus. 'I think that's the right thing to do for the economy, we need to help businesses have a bridge to get to the other side.'His package came as the Bank of England's base rate was slashed to an historic low of just 0.25 per cent.Mr Johnson will confirm today that the UK is switching from a strategy of trying to contain the outbreak to one of trying to delay its worst effects in order to give the NHS more time to cope. The Prime Minister - one of whose Cabinet ministers went into self-isolation last night along with five other MPs - is also likely to announce a range of social-distancing measures.However, the government is not expected to go as far as Donald Trump, who yesterday told Americans he was ordering an immediate shut-down of all travel from Europe. Irish PM Leo Varadkar has declared that schools, colleges and childcare facilities are to close for two weeks.He made a live statement to the nation from Washington DC, where he is due to meet Mr Trump later as part of the annual St Patrick's Day programme of events.

'Unfortunately we must face the tragic reality that some people will die,' he said.Mr Varadkar said he was acting on fresh advice from the country's National Public Health Emergency Team.'The virus is all over the world, it will continue to spread but it can be slowed,' he said. Dr David Halpern, head of the UK's Behavioural Insights Team dubbed Britain's 'Nudge Unit' who reports directly to Mr Johnson, has suggested the 500,000 people in UK care homes or with respiratory conditions could be the only people protected.He has suggested the virus can be beaten by letting it spread through healthy people to kill it off rather than a nationwide lockdown that could allow coronavirus to rise again later in the year.Dr Halpern has revealed ministers are considering a policy of keeping high-risk groups such as the elderly or those with underlying health conditions isolated in care homes or in their own homes over the coming months.He said: 'There's going to be a point, assuming the epidemic flows and grows as it will do, where you want to cocoon, to protect those at-risk groups so they don't catch the disease.'By the time they come out of their cocooning, herd immunity has been achieved in the rest of the population'.  Deputy chief medical officer Jenny Harries was asked on the BBC if 'pretty much everyone will get it eventually'.Speaking hours after world health officials declared the coronavirus a pandemic, Trump repeatedly defended his own actions and vowed the nation would prevail in countering the virus and getting treatment on the market.'We will be suspending all travel from Europe to the United States for the next 30 days,' Trump announced, in a speech from the Oval Office to the nation. 'The new rules will go into effect Friday at midnight,' he said. The move was so sudden the acting Homeland Security secretary said he would issue full guidance on how to carry it out within 48 hours.The White House said the travel restrictions would apply to foreign nationals who have visited 26 European countries - but excluding the UK and Ireland - in the past 14 days. It will not apply to US citizens, their 'immediate' family members or legal permanent residents. But confusion remained over how exactly the rules would apply and in what time zone the deadline would be introduced. Chancellor Rishi Sunak today said the UK was not following the US example.'The advice we are getting is that there is not evidence that interventions like closing borders or travel bans are going to have a material effect on the spread of the infections,' he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.

[item name=video id=4181592 style=2 /]Chief medical officer Prof Chris Whitty added: 'We need to do it at the last point it is reasonable so people maintain their energy and enthusiasm... it is important we do not ask our fellow citizens to do it for longer than makes sense.' The FTSE plunged by more than 10 per cent today in response to the dramatic US announcement of a travel ban from Europe overnight, and growing global chaos. And in the latest high-profile victim of the outbreak, BT's chief executive, Philip Jansen, tested positive for COVID-19 on Thursday.'Having felt slightly unwell I decided as a precaution to be tested. As soon as the test results were known I isolated myself at home,' Jansen said in a statement. 'I've met several industry partners this week so felt it was the responsible thing to do to alert them to this fact as soon as I could.'Jansen said his symptoms seemed mild and he would work remotely over the coming week, avoiding disruption to the business of Britain's biggest telecoms group. The UK approach is increasingly at odds with that of other countries, with Ireland joining the list of those closing all schools and colleges and banning mass gatherings. In the first sign of splits within the UK, Nicola Sturgeon has declared that Scotland will also cancelling events with more than 500 people from the start of next week, saying that they take up too much time for emergency services.She admitted: 'These are not easy judgements. They are difficult and complicated.'The government has also made clear it will not follow Donald Trump's dramatic overnight move of closing the borders to travellers from mainland Europe. Instead Mr Johnson seems determined to take a limited response, asking those with a cold to self-quarantine, and urge vulnerable elderly people to stay indoors.Former Cabinet minister Rory Stewart this afternoon accused the PM of 'smug insular complacency, warning that without quick action there could be 100,000 cases in the UK within the next 24 days.'This is at risk of becoming an example of smug insular complacency - refusing to pay any attention to what any other country is doing or the successful public health approach in Asia,' the London Mayor hopeful said. 'We should show some humility, learn from others and act now.'

This stage of the UK's response has now ended.DELAY Ministers have ordered wider testing to assess prevalence in the community. Anyone with coronavirus-like symptoms is being asked to self-isolate.Sick pay provision has been bolstered to make the self-employed and low-paid workers more likely to comply. Further up the so-called 'ladder' of response options, vulnerable people could be urged to stay indoors, schools could be closed, and sports and public gatherings could be banned. Ministers say the scientific advice does not yet support that - although Ireland is closing schools, and Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon is banning gatherings of more than 500 people.The government has also rejected the US approach of barring travellers from mainland Europe for the moment. MITIGATE If the outbreak runs out of control, the NHS could cancel all non-urgent activity to focus on treating those affected.In an extreme situation, troops could be deployed to shore up the police and essential public services.Recently-retired doctors and nurses would be brought back to help plug gaps in the NHS, with many health workers expected to be infected along with regular members of the public. •Irish PM Leo Varadkar has declared that schools, colleges and childcare facilities are to close for two weeks;•Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon today declared that she is 'minded' to cancel mass gatherings of over 500 people from the start of next week to avoid them sucking up resources for police and health workers;•The US Congress is shutting the Capitol, House and Senate office buildings to public until April 1 in reaction to coronavirus;•The Electoral Commission has called for the local and mayoral polls due in May to be postponed until the Autumn;•The UK and the EU jointly announced that face to face Brexit trade talks next week would not go ahead as planned but they could be conducted using video technology;•The FTSE 100 fell by more than 9 per cent today as investors were rattled by US travel restrictions imposed by in an attempt to halt the pandemic;•The Czech Republic is closing its borders to travellers crossing from Germany and Austria and also banning the entry of foreigners coming from other risky countries to contain the coronavirus outbreak;•Norway and Lithuania are shutting down nurseries, schools and universities for at least two weeks, and Oslo has told workers to stay at least one metre apart in offices;•Labour has cancelled a conference to announce the results of its leadership contest, saying the replacement for Jeremy Corbyn will now be declared at a 'scaled back' event on April 4;•Canadian PM Justin Trudeau has self-isolated while his wife awaits the results of a coronavirus test;•The WHO warned that the travel ban announced by Mr Trump will do little to help combat coronavirus in the UK and could backfire by making people complacent;•Mr Sunak said he made 'no apology' for turning on the spending taps to counter the effects of the virus on the UK economy and society;•A Cabinet minister is awaiting the results of a coronavirus test today, with four other MPs in quarantine after health minister Nadine Dorries became the first politician to be diagnosed with the disease;•Tube and transport systems were quieter than usual as the public preempted the expected advice from government on restricting social contact;•Sporting events have been called off, with golf set to be played without crowds and the tennis tour put on hold for six weeks;•Sittings in Parliament could be scaled back and the authorities are considering closing to visitors amid fears of spread on the estate.[item name=video id=4181368 style=2 /][item name=video id=4181366 style=2 /]Early lockdown 'can cut coronavirus infections' Shocking charts show how the UK Government could prevent hundreds or even thousands of deaths by taking dramatic action now to fight the killer coronavirus and 'flatten the curve' of its spiralling epidemic.Prime Minister Boris Johnson today decided not to move forward in Britain's fight against COVID-19, declining to close schools, send people home from work or ban large gatherings.But he is coming under intense scrutiny for refusing to budge - one frustrated scientist warned: 'Now is the time for the UK government to ban large gatherings, ask people to stop non-essential travel, recommend employers shift to home working and ramp up the response.'Official advice currently doesn't go much further than telling citizens to wash their hands even though the UK now has more cases than China did when Wuhan's 11million people were forced into lockdown.Scientists and critics are urging the Government to do more to prolong an inevitable surge in cases, saying that a spike of infections could cripple the NHS but spreading the cases over a longer period of time would 'flatten the curve' and make it easier for the nation to cope. An analysis of statistics has shown that areas that acted fast have slashed their death rates by up to eight times compared to those who react after the virus has taken hold.In South Korea, for example, an area home to 2.5million people was put into lockdown when just 204 people had been diagnosed and one had died. The country now has a death rate of just 0.8 per cent despite more than 7,800 cases.But in Italy, large-scale lockdowns were not brought in until Sunday, March 8, by which time it had more than 5,800 patients. There are now almost 12,500 and 827 deaths - a death rate of 6.6 per cent. Ms Sturgeon said this evening that Scotland was shutting down public events 'that have the potential to have an impact on our frontline emergency services'.'This is not a move that we are making because the science has told us it will have a significant impact on the spread of the virus: on the contrary, the scientists tell us it will not have a significant impact on the spread of the virus - although no significant impact does not equate to no impact at all,' she said.'But there are wider reasons that I consider and have judged that are important in reaching this decision.''Certain events, whether or not they need dedicated ambulance cover, we know that certain events have an impact on our policing and our front-line health services, accident and emergency and ambulance services.'At a time when pressure on those services is going to be considerable ... it is incumbent on government to do what we can to remove unnecessary burdens on our public services.'The decision is set to come into force the day after Rangers host Celtic in one of this weekend's Ladbrokes Premiership fixtures, with the champions currently 13 points clear of their rivals.Prof Whitty said the UK would not be introducing social distancing measures yet as it was not the right moment within the pandemic.But he warned that advice would be coming for elderly and vulnerable people to isolate themselves from social gatherings.He said: 'The next stage along we are going to want to do a package of things that are about putting social distancing around the people who are older and those with severe health conditions.'But we do not think it is appropriate to make a national recommendation for that at the moment because it is too early in the course of the epidemic.'If you think about what would happen if you prematurely put elderly or vulnerable in a situation where you're saying, we really want to cut down on your social interactions, to cut back on your contact with others, it has big practical implications for them and may lead to loneliness and other issues which are clearly very undesirable for them.'While we will need to move to that stage, we do not think this is the right moment along the pandemic to do so. But that point will come.'Eariler, Mr Johnson swiped at political leaders who do not 'follow the science'. In comments made before Mr Trump's announcement, he said many leaders were 'under a lot of pressure to be seen to act'. Asked whether the PM knew of Mr Trump's escalation in advance, Downing Street said today: 'UK and US officials are in regular contact.' To fight what is now officially a global pandemic, the Budget handed hospitals a £5billion fighting fund while thousands of firms will be given a business rates holiday to help avert the risk of bankruptcy.Sick pay will be reformed to ensure that employees are not penalised for going into quarantine. In a round of interviews today, Mr Sunak told the BBC: 'I make absolutely no apology for responding in the short term in scale to the immediate threat that we face from coronavirus. 'Sleep alone, don't go for a walk and don't shake your dirty laundry': Government issues advice for people self-isolating   The Government issued a how-to guide for people forced to quarantine this afternoon.It came as Boris Johnson and his medical advisers said anyone with symptoms of coronavirus should stay at home for seven days. The guidance provides practical advice, including keeping away from all other human beings as much as possible.It includes: •You cannot go for a walk but you can use your own garden.•You can buy food and other supplies online but you must warn drivers to leave goods outside and do not invite them in.•Stay in a well-ventilated room with a window that can be opened.•Stay in a different room to other people you live with.•If that isn't possible stay two metres or three steps away from other people.•Sleep alone if possible.•Do not have visitors.•Use your own toothbrushes, eating and drinking utensils, dishes, drinks, towels, washcloths or bedlinen.•Use the kitchen at different times to others in the house and eat alone.•Use a dishwasher if you have one.•If you are breastfeeding, consider asking someone else to feed the baby using expressed milk in a bottle.•Bag personal waste like used tissues inside two bags and keep it away from other household waste for 72 hours before adding to refuse.•Do not shake dirty laundry; this minimises the possibility of dispersing virus through the air.•If you don't have a washing machine wait until after you isolation before going to a launderette.•Keep hydrated by drinking water.•Clean your hands frequently with soap and water for at least 20 seconds.'I think that's the right thing to do for the economy, we need to help businesses have a bridge to get to the other side.'His package came as the Bank of England's base rate was slashed to an historic low of just 0.25 per cent.Mr Johnson will confirm today that the UK is switching from a strategy of trying to contain the outbreak to one of trying to delay its worst effects in order to give the NHS more time to cope. The Prime Minister - one of whose Cabinet ministers went into self-isolation last night along with five other MPs - is also likely to announce a range of social-distancing measures.However, the government is not expected to go as far as Donald Trump, who yesterday told Americans he was ordering an immediate shut-down of all travel from Europe. Irish PM Leo Varadkar has declared that schools, colleges and childcare facilities are to close for two weeks.He made a live statement to the nation from Washington DC, where he is due to meet Mr Trump later as part of the annual St Patrick's Day programme of events. 'Unfortunately we must face the tragic reality that some people will die,' he said.Mr Varadkar said he was acting on fresh advice from the country's National Public Health Emergency Team.'The virus is all over the world, it will continue to spread but it can be slowed,' he said. Dr David Halpern, head of the UK's Behavioural Insights Team dubbed Britain's 'Nudge Unit' who reports directly to Mr Johnson, has suggested the 500,000 people in UK care homes or with respiratory conditions could be the only people protected.He has suggested the virus can be beaten by letting it spread through healthy people to kill it off rather than a nationwide lockdown that could allow coronavirus to rise again later in the year.Dr Halpern has revealed ministers are considering a policy of keeping high-risk groups such as the elderly or those with underlying health conditions isolated in care homes or in their own homes over the coming months.He said: 'There's going to be a point, assuming the epidemic flows and grows as it will do, where you want to cocoon, to protect those at-risk groups so they don't catch the disease.'By the time they come out of their cocooning, herd immunity has been achieved in the rest of the population'.                      FTSE tumbles again on fears of economic chaos                     The London Stock Exchange's leading index of companies today plummeted as much as 10.9 per cent, wiping almost £160 billion off the value of its constituents.Early in the day investors reacted to the World Health Organisation's upgrade of the Covid-19 outbreak to a global pandemic.However the index fell further still in the afternoon, hitting an eight-year low after markets opened down in the US and the European Central Bank unveiled a coronavirus stimulus package, but kept interest rates steady.Within moments of the FTSE 100 opening, it sank more than 300 points, to levels not seen for eight years. More than £520 billion has been wiped since February 21 - a fall of 28%.It means the index is technically in a 'bear market' where the value of shares has fallen by more than 20%.Deputy chief medical officer Jenny Harries was asked on the BBC if 'pretty much everyone will get it eventually'.'The thing about a new virus is, of course, nobody has antibodies ready-made to it. This virus is having a field day, the desire will be to infect as many people as it can,' she said.Dr Harries said it was possible that 'up to 80 per cent of the population' could contract the virus, but added that it was a 'very high estimate'.Scottish First minister Nicola Sturgeon said it was not possible to make the virus 'go away'.'This is a serious situation. We cannot make this virus go away. It is highly likely now that significant numbers of us are going to get this virus,' she said.'The vast majority will have very mild illness and the clear focus right now is on doing everything we can to protect those who are more susceptible to serious illness, but we cannot make this go away, we need to focus on how we manage this outbreak, delay the spread and reduce the numbers infected at any one time.'Scottish Secretary Alister Jack told BBC Radio Scotland's Good Morning Scotland programme there is 'no doubt we are not going to be able to contain it for very much longer' and that efforts will now focus on delaying the spread of the virus to 'put less pressure on the NHS'. Speaking hours after world health officials declared the coronavirus a pandemic, Trump repeatedly defended his own actions and vowed the nation would prevail in countering the virus and getting treatment on the market.'We will be suspending all travel from Europe to the United States for the next 30 days,' Trump announced, in a speech from the Oval Office to the nation. 'The new rules will go into effect Friday at midnight,' he said. The move was so sudden the acting Homeland Security secretary said he would issue full guidance on how to carry it out within 48 hours.                     WHAT IS HERD IMMUNITY?                    Herd immunity is a situation in which a population of people is protected from a disease because so many of them are unaffected by it that it cannot spread. To cause an outbreak a disease-causing bacteria or virus must have a continuous supply of potential victims who are not immune to it.Immunity is when your body knows exactly how to fight off a certain type of infection because it has encountered it before, either by having the illness in the past or through a vaccine.When a virus or bacteria enters the body the immune system creates substances called antibodies, which are designed to destroy one specific type of bug.When these have been created once, some of them remain in the body and the body also remembers how to make them again. This provides long-term protection, or immunity, against an illness.If nobody is immune to an illness - as was the case at the beginning of the coronavirus outbreak - it can spread like wildfire.However, if, for example, half of people have developed immunity - from a past infection or a vaccine - there are only half as many people the illness can spread to.As more and more people become immune the bug finds it harder and harder to spread until its pool of victims becomes so small it can no longer spread at all.The threshold for herd immunity is different for various illnesses, depending on how contagious they are - for measles, around 95 per cent of people must be vaccinated to it spreading.For polio, which is less contagious, the threshold is about 80-85 per cent, according to the Oxford Vaccine Group.The White House said the travel restrictions would apply to foreign nationals who have visited 26 European countries - but excluding the UK and Ireland - in the past 14 days. It will not apply to US citizens, their 'immediate' family members or legal permanent residents. But confusion remained over how exactly the rules would apply and in what time zone the deadline would be introduced. Chancellor Rishi Sunak today said the UK was not following the US example.'The advice we are getting is that there is not evidence that interventions like closing borders or travel bans are going to have a material effect on the spread of the infections,' he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. 'That is why we have taken the decisions that we have.' A video posted on the No10 Twitter feed yesterday shows Mr Johnson chatting with Deputy Chief Medical Officer Jenny Harries.Mr Johnson said: 'It's noticeable that there are some countries where they have banned big sporting events and stopped mass gatherings of one kind or another. Tell us why so far the medical advice in this country is not to do that?'Dr Harries replied that 'expert modellers' had looked at what would happen with the virus. 'In general those sorts of events and big gatherings are not seen as something that is going to have a big effect. So we don't want to disrupt people's lives,' she said.The FTSE index of Britain's leading companies fell 365 points or 6.22 per cent to 5,511 shortly after opening today - its lowest level since February 2016.The falls were in reaction to Mr Trump's intervention, and came despite the Bank of England slashing interest rates from 0.75 per cent to 0.25 per cent and the Budget plan.                      Norway goes into lock-down over coronavirus despite no deaths so far                    Norway's government announced its most complete peacetime shutdown today in a bid to keep coronavirus at bay.Prime Minister Erna Solberg 'the strongest and most intrusive measures' seen outside of war would take effect from this evening.The strict measures included closing schools and universities and banning sporting events.Health workers have been banned from going abroad and all other citizens have been advised not to. 'The measures will have a significant effect on our individual freedoms,' Ms Solberg said. Norway has so far had 621 confirmed cases of COVID-19, with no deaths. Cultural events will be cancelled and Norwegians were asked to avoid public transport and work from home.Bars, public swimming pools, gyms, hairdressers, massage and tattoo parlours, among others will be closed.Restaurants need to ensure that guests are able to keep a minimum distance of one metre from each other and can no longer serve buffets.In addition, the government said all people returning from trips outside the Nordic region must be quarantined for two weeks.Most of the measures introduced will remain in place until March 26 to start with, health minister Bent Hoie said.Speaking before Mr Trump's speech last night, Mr Johnson said: 'There's obviously people under a lot pf pressure - politicians government around the world under a lot of pressure to be seen to act. So they may do things that are not necessarily dictated by the science.'Dr Harries said: 'I am absolutely delighted that we are following the science and the evidence.' She added: 'We have got very clear advice about when we should intervene and that is exactly what I think we should do.' Mr Sunak admitted yesterday that the epidemic was now likely to cause 'temporary disruption to the economy', with millions of workers having to take time off sick, firms struggling with supply problems and shops and restaurants hit by a dramatic fall in trade.'The combination of those effects will have a significant impact on the UK economy,' he said. 'But it will be temporary. People will return to work.'Supply chains will return to normal. Life will return to normal. For a period, it's going to be tough. But I'm confident that our economic performance will recover.'The emergency package, which was only finalised in the early hours of yesterday, overshadowed a series of massive spending decisions that set the Government's economic course for the next four years.Mr Sunak pledged to increase total spending by 22 per cent by 2024, taking the size of the state to more than £1trillion for the first time. Much of the spending will be fuelled by borrowing, with the national debt now on track to top £2trillion by the time of the next election.There will be a rise in the threshold for paying national insurance that delivers an immediate £100 tax cut for 31million workers. The OBR yesterday warned that the coronavirus could lead to a prolonged slowdown, adding: 'Recession this year is quite possible if the spread of coronavirus causes widespread economic disruption.' Mr Sunak said he was ready to make further interventions to ensure that good businesses were not driven to the wall.He said yesterday's £30billion package comprised £12billion of direct spending and £18billion of broader stimulus to the economy.'While the world may slow down, we will act here with a response that is brave and bold, taking decisions now for our future prosperity,' the Chancellor added. 'We are investing in world class infrastructure, and to lead the world in the industries and technologies of the future.'Mr Sunak said the 'central decision' was to increase spending over existing plans by £175billion.The overall tax burden will not rise, mainly because of a decision to abandon a cut in corporation tax. The Treasury admitted the spending might not meet earlier fiscal rules.Some senior Tories voiced reservations. Theresa May said the Conservatives must never fall into Labour's trap of believing that all problems could be fixed by unconstrained spending.The former prime minister added: 'While spending a lot of money may be popular and may seem the natural thing to do, there is of course that necessity of having a realistic assessment of the longer-term impact.'[There is] a necessity to ensure that we have that restraint and caution that enables us to make sure the public finances continue to be strong into the future.'",'herd_immunity,,"(8, ""the number of uk cases has risen by 130 and the death toll hit 10 in the last 24 hours, with experts increasingly bracing for turmoil as the overwhelming majority of the population becomes infected and the country develops 'herd_immunity'."")",80

The Prime Minister said it was clear the disease will continue to spread around the world and people should brace for the 'reality' of 'severe disruption' for many months.At a press conference in Westminster, Mr Johnson formally declared that the UK's tactics have shifted from 'containing' the killer disease to merely 'delaying' its inevitable spread, after he chaired a meeting of the Cobra emergency committee. The Government's new plan urges anyone with even mild coronavirus-like symptoms - a persistent cough or a fever - to quarantine themselves at home and to sleep alone if possible and stay at least two metres from relatives.The PM has also recommended all overseas school trips be cancelled while people over the age of 70 or those with pre-existing serious medical conditions have been told not to go on cruises.But he stopped short of more extreme measures such as closing schools and banning mass gatherings which have been adopted in Ireland, Norway, France and Italy in an effort to stem the spread of the virus. 'At all stages we have been guided by the science. We will do the right thing at the right time,' Mr Johnson said. The number of UK cases has risen by 130 and the death toll hit 10 in the last 24 hours, with experts increasingly bracing for turmoil as the overwhelming majority of the population becomes infected and the country develops 'herd immunity'. But chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance said he believed the true number of infections was likely to be 5,000-10,000 already. He estimated that the UK was four weeks behind the trajectory of the crisis in Italy - which has brought the country to its knees.The peak of the outbreak in the UK might not come for 10-14 weeks, the experts said - suggesting it will run into June. [item name=video id=4181624 style=2 /]Mr Johnson insisted comparisons to seasonal flu were wrong. 'This is more dangerous and it's going to spread further. And I must level with you and the British public: more families, many more families, are going to lose loved ones before their time,' he said. Despite the bloodcurdling warnings, Mr Johnson said the UK would not close schools yet even though government advisers admitted the move would help stem the outbreak. Advisers said the length of closure necessary to make the measure work could be more than 16 weeks and would at this stage therefore not be feasible. Chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance said it was not realistic to expect children to be cooped up that long. He said: 'It is true that there is some effect in closing schools but that effect is minimal and actually you would have to do it for 13 to 16 weeks or longer.'You do not have to be a very advanced mathematician to work out that the chances of keeping children not speaking to each other or playing with each other are zero.'Closing down schools could also put elderly grandparents at risk if they were asked to look after children, who are believed to be less susceptible to the most severe form of the disease but can still spread it.'The scientific advice is that this could do more harm than good,' Mr Johnson said. 'But we are keeping this under review and this could change as the disease spreads. Schools should only close if they are specifically advised to do so.'Mr Johnson conceded that Scotland was already banning mass gatherings, but suggested there was a 'particular issue with the resilience of their public services' north of the border, in a perceived swipe at Nicola Sturgeon after she undermined him by announcing her plans first.'We are not saying no to that sort of measures, of course not,' Mr Johnson said. 'We are keeping it up our sleeves. But it is very important... that we get the timing right.' [item name=video id=4181592 style=2 /]Chief medical officer Prof Chris Whitty added: 'We need to do it at the last point it is reasonable so people maintain their energy and enthusiasm... it is important we do not ask our fellow citizens to do it for longer than makes sense.' The FTSE plunged by more than 10 per cent today in response to the dramatic US announcement of a travel ban from Europe overnight, and growing global chaos. And in the latest high-profile victim of the outbreak, BT's chief executive, Philip Jansen, tested positive for COVID-19 on Thursday.'Having felt slightly unwell I decided as a precaution to be tested. As soon as the test results were known I isolated myself at home,' Jansen said in a statement.

MITIGATE If the outbreak runs out of control, the NHS could cancel all non-urgent activity to focus on treating those affected.In an extreme situation, troops could be deployed to shore up the police and essential public services.Recently-retired doctors and nurses would be brought back to help plug gaps in the NHS, with many health workers expected to be infected along with regular members of the public. •Irish PM Leo Varadkar has declared that schools, colleges and childcare facilities are to close for two weeks;•Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon today declared that she is 'minded' to cancel mass gatherings of over 500 people from the start of next week to avoid them sucking up resources for police and health workers;•The US Congress is shutting the Capitol, House and Senate office buildings to public until April 1 in reaction to coronavirus;•The Electoral Commission has called for the local and mayoral polls due in May to be postponed until the Autumn;•The UK and the EU jointly announced that face to face Brexit trade talks next week would not go ahead as planned but they could be conducted using video technology;•The FTSE 100 fell by more than 9 per cent today as investors were rattled by US travel restrictions imposed by in an attempt to halt the pandemic;•The Czech Republic is closing its borders to travellers crossing from Germany and Austria and also banning the entry of foreigners coming from other risky countries to contain the coronavirus outbreak;•Norway and Lithuania are shutting down nurseries, schools and universities for at least two weeks, and Oslo has told workers to stay at least one metre apart in offices;•Labour has cancelled a conference to announce the results of its leadership contest, saying the replacement for Jeremy Corbyn will now be declared at a 'scaled back' event on April 4;•Canadian PM Justin Trudeau has self-isolated while his wife awaits the results of a coronavirus test;•The WHO warned that the travel ban announced by Mr Trump will do little to help combat coronavirus in the UK and could backfire by making people complacent;•Mr Sunak said he made 'no apology' for turning on the spending taps to counter the effects of the virus on the UK economy and society;•A Cabinet minister is awaiting the results of a coronavirus test today, with four other MPs in quarantine after health minister Nadine Dorries became the first politician to be diagnosed with the disease;•Tube and transport systems were quieter than usual as the public preempted the expected advice from government on restricting social contact;•Sporting events have been called off, with golf set to be played without crowds and the tennis tour put on hold for six weeks;•Sittings in Parliament could be scaled back and the authorities are considering closing to visitors amid fears of spread on the estate.[item name=video id=4181368 style=2 /][item name=video id=4181366 style=2 /]Early lockdown 'can cut coronavirus infections' Shocking charts show how the UK Government could prevent hundreds or even thousands of deaths by taking dramatic action now to fight the killer coronavirus and 'flatten the curve' of its spiralling epidemic.Prime Minister Boris Johnson today decided not to move forward in Britain's fight against COVID-19, declining to close schools, send people home from work or ban large gatherings.But he is coming under intense scrutiny for refusing to budge - one frustrated scientist warned: 'Now is the time for the UK government to ban large gatherings, ask people to stop non-essential travel, recommend employers shift to home working and ramp up the response.'Official advice currently doesn't go much further than telling citizens to wash their hands even though the UK now has more cases than China did when Wuhan's 11million people were forced into lockdown.Scientists and critics are urging the Government to do more to prolong an inevitable surge in cases, saying that a spike of infections could cripple the NHS but spreading the cases over a longer period of time would 'flatten the curve' and make it easier for the nation to cope. An analysis of statistics has shown that areas that acted fast have slashed their death rates by up to eight times compared to those who react after the virus has taken hold.In South Korea, for example, an area home to 2.5million people was put into lockdown when just 204 people had been diagnosed and one had died. The country now has a death rate of just 0.8 per cent despite more than 7,800 cases.But in Italy, large-scale lockdowns were not brought in until Sunday, March 8, by which time it had more than 5,800 patients. There are now almost 12,500 and 827 deaths - a death rate of 6.6 per cent. Ms Sturgeon said this evening that Scotland was shutting down public events 'that have the potential to have an impact on our frontline emergency services'.'This is not a move that we are making because the science has told us it will have a significant impact on the spread of the virus: on the contrary, the scientists tell us it will not have a significant impact on the spread of the virus - although no significant impact does not equate to no impact at all,' she said.'But there are wider reasons that I consider and have judged that are important in reaching this decision.''Certain events, whether or not they need dedicated ambulance cover, we know that certain events have an impact on our policing and our front-line health services, accident and emergency and ambulance services.'At a time when pressure on those services is going to be considerable ... it is incumbent on government to do what we can to remove unnecessary burdens on our public services.'The decision is set to come into force the day after Rangers host Celtic in one of this weekend's Ladbrokes Premiership fixtures, with the champions currently 13 points clear of their rivals.Prof Whitty said the UK would not be introducing social distancing measures yet as it was not the right moment within the pandemic.But he warned that advice would be coming for elderly and vulnerable people to isolate themselves from social gatherings.He said: 'The next stage along we are going to want to do a package of things that are about putting social distancing around the people who are older and those with severe health conditions.'But we do not think it is appropriate to make a national recommendation for that at the moment because it is too early in the course of the epidemic.'If you think about what would happen if you prematurely put elderly or vulnerable in a situation where you're saying, we really want to cut down on your social interactions, to cut back on your contact with others, it has big practical implications for them and may lead to loneliness and other issues which are clearly very undesirable for them.'While we will need to move to that stage, we do not think this is the right moment along the pandemic to do so. But that point will come.'Eariler, Mr Johnson swiped at political leaders who do not 'follow the science'. In comments made before Mr Trump's announcement, he said many leaders were 'under a lot of pressure to be seen to act'. Asked whether the PM knew of Mr Trump's escalation in advance, Downing Street said today: 'UK and US officials are in regular contact.' To fight what is now officially a global pandemic, the Budget handed hospitals a £5billion fighting fund while thousands of firms will be given a business rates holiday to help avert the risk of bankruptcy.Sick pay will be reformed to ensure that employees are not penalised for going into quarantine. In a round of interviews today, Mr Sunak told the BBC: 'I make absolutely no apology for responding in the short term in scale to the immediate threat that we face from coronavirus. 'Sleep alone, don't go for a walk and don't shake your dirty laundry': Government issues advice for people self-isolating   The Government issued a how-to guide for people forced to quarantine this afternoon.It came as Boris Johnson and his medical advisers said anyone with symptoms of coronavirus should stay at home for seven days. The guidance provides practical advice, including keeping away from all other human beings as much as possible.It includes: •You cannot go for a walk but you can use your own garden.•You can buy food and other supplies online but you must warn drivers to leave goods outside and do not invite them in.•Stay in a well-ventilated room with a window that can be opened.•Stay in a different room to other people you live with.•If that isn't possible stay two metres or three steps away from other people.•Sleep alone if possible.•Do not have visitors.•Use your own toothbrushes, eating and drinking utensils, dishes, drinks, towels, washcloths or bedlinen.•Use the kitchen at different times to others in the house and eat alone.•Use a dishwasher if you have one.•If you are breastfeeding, consider asking someone else to feed the baby using expressed milk in a bottle.•Bag personal waste like used tissues inside two bags and keep it away from other household waste for 72 hours before adding to refuse.•Do not shake dirty laundry; this minimises the possibility of dispersing virus through the air.•If you don't have a washing machine wait until after you isolation before going to a launderette.•Keep hydrated by drinking water.•Clean your hands frequently with soap and water for at least 20 seconds.'I think that's the right thing to do for the economy, we need to help businesses have a bridge to get to the other side.'His package came as the Bank of England's base rate was slashed to an historic low of just 0.25 per cent.Mr Johnson will confirm today that the UK is switching from a strategy of trying to contain the outbreak to one of trying to delay its worst effects in order to give the NHS more time to cope. The Prime Minister - one of whose Cabinet ministers went into self-isolation last night along with five other MPs - is also likely to announce a range of social-distancing measures.However, the government is not expected to go as far as Donald Trump, who yesterday told Americans he was ordering an immediate shut-down of all travel from Europe. Irish PM Leo Varadkar has declared that schools, colleges and childcare facilities are to close for two weeks.He made a live statement to the nation from Washington DC, where he is due to meet Mr Trump later as part of the annual St Patrick's Day programme of events. 'Unfortunately we must face the tragic reality that some people will die,' he said.Mr Varadkar said he was acting on fresh advice from the country's National Public Health Emergency Team.'The virus is all over the world, it will continue to spread but it can be slowed,' he said. Dr David Halpern, head of the UK's Behavioural Insights Team dubbed Britain's 'Nudge Unit' who reports directly to Mr Johnson, has suggested the 500,000 people in UK care homes or with respiratory conditions could be the only people protected.He has suggested the virus can be beaten by letting it spread through healthy people to kill it off rather than a nationwide lockdown that could allow coronavirus to rise again later in the year.Dr Halpern has revealed ministers are considering a policy of keeping high-risk groups such as the elderly or those with underlying health conditions isolated in care homes or in their own homes over the coming months.He said: 'There's going to be a point, assuming the epidemic flows and grows as it will do, where you want to cocoon, to protect those at-risk groups so they don't catch the disease.'By the time they come out of their cocooning, herd immunity has been achieved in the rest of the population'.                      FTSE tumbles again on fears of economic chaos                     The London Stock Exchange's leading index of companies today plummeted as much as 10.9 per cent, wiping almost £160 billion off the value of its constituents.Early in the day investors reacted to the World Health Organisation's upgrade of the Covid-19 outbreak to a global pandemic.However the index fell further still in the afternoon, hitting an eight-year low after markets opened down in the US and the European Central Bank unveiled a coronavirus stimulus package, but kept interest rates steady.Within moments of the FTSE 100 opening, it sank more than 300 points, to levels not seen for eight years. More than £520 billion has been wiped since February 21 - a fall of 28%.It means the index is technically in a 'bear market' where the value of shares has fallen by more than 20%.Deputy chief medical officer Jenny Harries was asked on the BBC if 'pretty much everyone will get it eventually'.'The thing about a new virus is, of course, nobody has antibodies ready-made to it. This virus is having a field day, the desire will be to infect as many people as it can,' she said.Dr Harries said it was possible that 'up to 80 per cent of the population' could contract the virus, but added that it was a 'very high estimate'.Scottish First minister Nicola Sturgeon said it was not possible to make the virus 'go away'.'This is a serious situation. We cannot make this virus go away. It is highly likely now that significant numbers of us are going to get this virus,' she said.'The vast majority will have very mild illness and the clear focus right now is on doing everything we can to protect those who are more susceptible to serious illness, but we cannot make this go away, we need to focus on how we manage this outbreak, delay the spread and reduce the numbers infected at any one time.'Scottish Secretary Alister Jack told BBC Radio Scotland's Good Morning Scotland programme there is 'no doubt we are not going to be able to contain it for very much longer' and that efforts will now focus on delaying the spread of the virus to 'put less pressure on the NHS'. Speaking hours after world health officials declared the coronavirus a pandemic, Trump repeatedly defended his own actions and vowed the nation would prevail in countering the virus and getting treatment on the market.'We will be suspending all travel from Europe to the United States for the next 30 days,' Trump announced, in a speech from the Oval Office to the nation. 'The new rules will go into effect Friday at midnight,' he said. The move was so sudden the acting Homeland Security secretary said he would issue full guidance on how to carry it out within 48 hours.                     WHAT IS HERD IMMUNITY?                    Herd immunity is a situation in which a population of people is protected from a disease because so many of them are unaffected by it that it cannot spread. To cause an outbreak a disease-causing bacteria or virus must have a continuous supply of potential victims who are not immune to it.Immunity is when your body knows exactly how to fight off a certain type of infection because it has encountered it before, either by having the illness in the past or through a vaccine.When a virus or bacteria enters the body the immune system creates substances called antibodies, which are designed to destroy one specific type of bug.When these have been created once, some of them remain in the body and the body also remembers how to make them again. This provides long-term protection, or immunity, against an illness.If nobody is immune to an illness - as was the case at the beginning of the coronavirus outbreak - it can spread like wildfire.However, if, for example, half of people have developed immunity - from a past infection or a vaccine - there are only half as many people the illness can spread to.As more and more people become immune the bug finds it harder and harder to spread until its pool of victims becomes so small it can no longer spread at all.The threshold for herd immunity is different for various illnesses, depending on how contagious they are - for measles, around 95 per cent of people must be vaccinated to it spreading.For polio, which is less contagious, the threshold is about 80-85 per cent, according to the Oxford Vaccine Group.The White House said the travel restrictions would apply to foreign nationals who have visited 26 European countries - but excluding the UK and Ireland - in the past 14 days. It will not apply to US citizens, their 'immediate' family members or legal permanent residents. But confusion remained over how exactly the rules would apply and in what time zone the deadline would be introduced. Chancellor Rishi Sunak today said the UK was not following the US example.'The advice we are getting is that there is not evidence that interventions like closing borders or travel bans are going to have a material effect on the spread of the infections,' he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. 'That is why we have taken the decisions that we have.' A video posted on the No10 Twitter feed yesterday shows Mr Johnson chatting with Deputy Chief Medical Officer Jenny Harries.Mr Johnson said: 'It's noticeable that there are some countries where they have banned big sporting events and stopped mass gatherings of one kind or another. Tell us why so far the medical advice in this country is not to do that?'Dr Harries replied that 'expert modellers' had looked at what would happen with the virus. 'In general those sorts of events and big gatherings are not seen as something that is going to have a big effect. So we don't want to disrupt people's lives,' she said.The FTSE index of Britain's leading companies fell 365 points or 6.22 per cent to 5,511 shortly after opening today - its lowest level since February 2016.The falls were in reaction to Mr Trump's intervention, and came despite the Bank of England slashing interest rates from 0.75 per cent to 0.25 per cent and the Budget plan.                      Norway goes into lock-down over coronavirus despite no deaths so far                    Norway's government announced its most complete peacetime shutdown today in a bid to keep coronavirus at bay.Prime Minister Erna Solberg 'the strongest and most intrusive measures' seen outside of war would take effect from this evening.The strict measures included closing schools and universities and banning sporting events.Health workers have been banned from going abroad and all other citizens have been advised not to. 'The measures will have a significant effect on our individual freedoms,' Ms Solberg said. Norway has so far had 621 confirmed cases of COVID-19, with no deaths. Cultural events will be cancelled and Norwegians were asked to avoid public transport and work from home.Bars, public swimming pools, gyms, hairdressers, massage and tattoo parlours, among others will be closed.Restaurants need to ensure that guests are able to keep a minimum distance of one metre from each other and can no longer serve buffets.In addition, the government said all people returning from trips outside the Nordic region must be quarantined for two weeks.Most of the measures introduced will remain in place until March 26 to start with, health minister Bent Hoie said.Speaking before Mr Trump's speech last night, Mr Johnson said: 'There's obviously people under a lot pf pressure - politicians government around the world under a lot of pressure to be seen to act. So they may do things that are not necessarily dictated by the science.'Dr Harries said: 'I am absolutely delighted that we are following the science and the evidence.' She added: 'We have got very clear advice about when we should intervene and that is exactly what I think we should do.' Mr Sunak admitted yesterday that the epidemic was now likely to cause 'temporary disruption to the economy', with millions of workers having to take time off sick, firms struggling with supply problems and shops and restaurants hit by a dramatic fall in trade.'The combination of those effects will have a significant impact on the UK economy,' he said. 'But it will be temporary. People will return to work.'Supply chains will return to normal. Life will return to normal. For a period, it's going to be tough. But I'm confident that our economic performance will recover.'The emergency package, which was only finalised in the early hours of yesterday, overshadowed a series of massive spending decisions that set the Government's economic course for the next four years.Mr Sunak pledged to increase total spending by 22 per cent by 2024, taking the size of the state to more than £1trillion for the first time. Much of the spending will be fuelled by borrowing, with the national debt now on track to top £2trillion by the time of the next election.There will be a rise in the threshold for paying national insurance that delivers an immediate £100 tax cut for 31million workers. The OBR yesterday warned that the coronavirus could lead to a prolonged slowdown, adding: 'Recession this year is quite possible if the spread of coronavirus causes widespread economic disruption.' Mr Sunak said he was ready to make further interventions to ensure that good businesses were not driven to the wall.He said yesterday's £30billion package comprised £12billion of direct spending and £18billion of broader stimulus to the economy.'While the world may slow down, we will act here with a response that is brave and bold, taking decisions now for our future prosperity,' the Chancellor added. 'We are investing in world class infrastructure, and to lead the world in the industries and technologies of the future.'Mr Sunak said the 'central decision' was to increase spending over existing plans by £175billion.The overall tax burden will not rise, mainly because of a decision to abandon a cut in corporation tax. The Treasury admitted the spending might not meet earlier fiscal rules.Some senior Tories voiced reservations. Theresa May said the Conservatives must never fall into Labour's trap of believing that all problems could be fixed by unconstrained spending.The former prime minister added: 'While spending a lot of money may be popular and may seem the natural thing to do, there is of course that necessity of having a realistic assessment of the longer-term impact.'[There is] a necessity to ensure that we have that restraint and caution that enables us to make sure the public finances continue to be strong into the future.'",'nudge_unit,,"(101, ""dr david halpern, head of the uk's behavioural_insights_team dubbed britain's 'nudge_unit' who reports directly to mr johnson, has suggested the 500,000 people in uk care homes or with respiratory conditions could be the only people protected."")",81

But the strict protocol will raise concerns that infected patients are going undetected, left to spread the disease.One retired intensive care doctor said he had friends who were repeatedly refused tests earlier this month after developing severe flu-like symptoms following a ski trip.The group had been to the Ischgl resort in Austria, which is not currently on NHS 111's list of high-risk countries - although some nations consider it a risk area.The 55 year-year-old, who gave his name only as Andrew, told the Guardian: These people are saying they are as ill as they've ever been, and they still can't do a test.' He added that he had also never been so ill' and had hoped to be tested. The NHS yesterday announced it would start to test 10,000 people a day - up from 1,500. But patients are only offered a test if they have been to high risk' countries including China, Iran, South Korea or Italy, or have knowingly come into contact with an infected individual.Sam Freedman, chief executive of the international, non-profit Education Partnerships Group, said the system had a major flaw.'He added on Twitter: Unfortunately I have a cough and a fever. Turns out I can't get a test because I haven't been to any affected countries or come into contact with a known case. Even though I have been through an airport and to a concert.'Another patient, Sam Butler, tweeted: I've got the worst flu I've ever had (despite flu jab)... It fits the description of COVID exactly, but NHS 111 says it isn't, because I haven't been abroad.'A spokesman for Public Health England said they are testing people with symptoms who are most likely' to be infected.   PLAN TO COCOON' CARE HOMESTHE ELDERLY and care home residents will be cocooned' from the outside world to protect them from coronavirus.Ministers are considering a policy of keeping high-risk groups apart from the wider population until herd immunity' has been established.Dr David Halpern, chief executive of the Government-owned Behavioural Insights team, also suggested that volunteers would be recruited to help out in care homes.

Mr Stewart, who led the UK's effort to fight ebola in Africa in 2019, said: 'I think we can be very tough, and clear, [with the British public]. This is the worst pandemic we have had for 100 years.'The Government's approach is essentially defeatist. They are saying we cannot suppress this. They say there is no point in spending a huge amount of money trying to suppress this, instead they are trying to manage the increase. We are taking far too much risk. 'I think that is a dangerous thing to do. I don't think if we allow this to spread it can be managed in that way.'And when you start getting serious numbers of people dying and the terrible choices that have to be made in hospitals, people will think that paying the cost early, now, was the right thing to do'.However, Downing Street hit back and said 'we are very clear where we take our advice from' - pointing to the contributions made by the Chief Medical Officer and the government's Chief Scientific Adviser. Number 10 also said action had been taken on care homes: 'We have set out that if people have concerns about their health or any symptoms they should not be visiting care homes.' But Mr Stewart, who is running to be the next Mayor of London as an independent, added: 'I'm absolutely confident that acting early is the better option. I would be shutting all schools and banning all gatherings immediately.'I think it is too pessimistic and defeatist and we should be taking the approach seen in China and South Korea that have actually reduced the number of cases. It can be done. It requires very tough and extreme measures.'The Government questions whether the public is up for the kind of measures we have seen in other countries. I disagree, I believe the British public will do what others have done'.Debate is raging over whether the Prime Minister has gone far enough to protect the UK's 66million people from the pandemic.The official number of coronavirus cases in the UK yesterday jumped by 134 to 596 with 10 deaths - but the Government's chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance said the true number was probably up to 10,000 cases and growing rapidly. But Mr Johnson has still held off drastic measures enforced across Europe such as banning mass gatherings and closing schools, telling Britons that the most important measure remains to wash hands for 20 seconds - and told people to stay at home for seven days if they have a new persistent cough or a high temperature. A ban on flights to and from Europe - like the one announced by US President Donald Trump - was also dismissed by the Government yesterday. Asked about the decision not to cancel large gatherings yet, with 70,000 at Cheltenham for the Gold Cup today, Jeremy Hunt told the BBC's Newsnight: 'I think it is surprising and concerning that we're not doing any of it at all when we have just four weeks before we get to the stage that Italy is at.'He added: 'The issue is not whether you or I might get infected at a football match, it's who we go on to meet.' English football's leaders have taken matters in to their own hands today as players and managers fell ill, with all professional matches including the Premier League cancelled until April 3 at the earliest. [item name=video id=4183448 style=2 /][item name=video id=4183106 style=2 /][related]Italy - the world's worst-hit country after China - is in complete lockdown as the country's tally of deaths has topped 1,000 with more than 15,000 patients infected by the virus. In response to the growing threat across Europe, Ireland yesterday closed all schools, colleges and nurseries and banned gatherings of more than 500 people. Norway's Prime Minister Erna Solberg last night put the country on a footing never seen in peacetime, despite having recorded no coronavirus deaths yet. Ms Solberg took all the Irish steps as well as banning all health workers from leaving the country, and forcing anyone returning from abroad into quarantine, including the king and queen who have been on a state visit to Jordan. But controversially the British Government appears to be pursuing a policy of 'herd immunity' - where the majority of the healthy population will get and fight off the virus so that the disease cannot be spread easily any more. The elderly and ill will be 'cocooned' from the outside world to protect them for weeks or even months. Critics have warned the policy is high risk because there have been multiple reports in China of people getting it twice - and concerns from experts that coronavirus could mutate and infect hundreds of thousands again in the coming years unless there is a vaccine.In other developments today to the escalating global crisis, which has seen more than 131,000 patients across the world get infected: •A Chinese spokesman accused the US military of bringing the coronavirus to Wuhan - the Chinese city where the COVID-19 outbreak began at the end of December;•A 37-year-old US woman who beat the infection claimed she didn't suffer the tell-tale symptom of a cough and instead only had a headache and tingling arms and legs;•French President Emmanuel Macron declared the pandemic as France's worst health crisis in a century and announced schools, universities and day-care centres would be shut from Monday;•Portuguese Prime Minister Antonio Costa ordered the shut-down of schools and universities and placed limits on the number of people in nightclubs, restaurants and shopping centres at any one time;•Belgium announced the closure of all schools, restaurants, cafes and nightclubs and also banned recreational and sporting events in its fight to contain the growing epidemic;•Danish authorities called on shoppers to avoid excessive stockpiling after it closed schools and universities and suspended indoor events with more than 100 participants;•Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon revealed gatherings of 500 people or more would be stopped from Monday and school trips would be cancelled;•Germany shut nightclubs and schools after Chancellor Angela Merkel warned that up to 70 per cent of the country's population - 58million people - could contract the coronavirus;•Spain locked down four towns in Catalonia, shut schools and universities and suspended Parliament after its deputy prime minister was in self-isolation after his wife tested positive for the virus;•An Italian medical chief died of the coronavirus at the age of 67, as the death toll in the country - the centre of Europe's escalating crisis - jumped to over 1,000;•Australia's Prime Minister Scott Morrison announced the government will effectively ban 'non essential' public gatherings of more than 500 people from Monday.Sir Patrick Vallance, the UK's chief scientific adviser, has today defended the Government's approach and its lack of hardline response along the lines seen across Europe.He told Sky News: 'We've got a panel of very world leading scientists across epidemiology, mathematical modelling, virology, clinicians, and we're taking input from leading academics to try and come up with a plan that actually does what we want to do.'It doesn't mean that the others are doing something wrong, and in fact much of the advice and much of the actions, if you look at them, they are trying to achieve the same thing.'And that is to try to reduce the peak of the epidemic, flatten it and broaden it so that you don't end up with so much intense pressure on healthcare systems at one time'.He added: 'And mass gatherings of course are a place where you can potentially get infection from somebody, but the alternative is also important that if you're not at a mass gathering, you're at a small gathering, and most of the transmission of these types of viruses occur in small gatherings, not in big gatherings'. Sir Patrick insists that telling people with cold and flu-like symptoms to stay at home for a week will have an impact.He said: 'The measures that were announced, which is about self-isolation, even if you've got very mild symptoms, will mean a large number of people actually at home, being isolated because of this infection.'That's a very big measure actually, it's going to have quite a big impact across a number of households and a number of people, so I don't think that's a trivial measure at all.'And all the modelling suggests that these sorts of measures, and the other two that we discussed yesterday, the ones that have the biggest impact'.Boris Johnson yesterday branded coronavirus the 'worst public health crisis in a generation' and warned that 'many more' people are going to die - but still held off drastic measures. Mr Hunt, chair of the Commons health and social care committee, said he was also 'personally surprised that we're still allowing external visits to care homes'. The Prime Minister said it was clear the disease will continue to spread around the world and people should brace for the 'reality' of 'severe disruption' for many months.At a press conference in Westminster, Mr Johnson formally declared that the UK's tactics have shifted from 'containing' the killer disease to merely 'delaying' its inevitable spread, after he chaired a meeting of the Cobra emergency committee. The Government's new plan urges anyone with even mild coronavirus-like symptoms - a persistent cough or a fever - to quarantine themselves at home and to sleep alone if possible and stay at least two metres from relatives.The PM has also recommended all overseas school trips be cancelled while people over the age of 70 or those with pre-existing serious medical conditions have been told not to go on cruises.But he stopped short of more extreme measures such as closing schools and banning mass gatherings which have been adopted in Ireland, Norway, France and Italy in an effort to stem the spread of the virus. 'At all stages we have been guided by the science. We will do the right thing at the right time,' Mr Johnson said. The number of UK cases has risen by 130 and the death toll hit 10 in the last 24 hours, with experts increasingly bracing for turmoil as the overwhelming majority of the population becomes infected and the country develops 'herd immunity'. But chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance said he believed the true number of infections was likely to be 5,000-10,000 already. He estimated that the UK was four weeks behind the trajectory of the crisis in Italy - which has brought the country to its knees.The peak of the outbreak in the UK might not come for 10-14 weeks, the experts said - suggesting it will run into June.

WHAT IS HERD IMMUNITY AND WILL IT EVEN WORK?  Herd immunity is a situation in which a population of people is protected from a disease because so many of them are unaffected by it that it cannot spread. To cause an outbreak a disease-causing bacteria or virus must have a continuous supply of potential victims who are not immune to it.Immunity is when your body knows exactly how to fight off a certain type of infection because it has encountered it before, either by having the illness in the past or through a vaccine.When a virus or bacteria enters the body the immune system creates substances called antibodies, which are designed to destroy one specific type of bug.When these have been created once, some of them remain in the body and the body also remembers how to make them again. This provides long-term protection, or immunity, against an illness.If nobody is immune to an illness - as was the case at the beginning of the coronavirus outbreak - it can spread like wildfire.However, if, for example, half of people have developed immunity - from a past infection or a vaccine - there are only half as many people the illness can spread to.As more and more people become immune the bug finds it harder and harder to spread until its pool of victims becomes so small it can no longer spread at all.The threshold for herd immunity is different for various illnesses, depending on how contagious they are - for measles, around 95 per cent of people must be vaccinated to it spreading.For polio, which is less contagious, the threshold is about 80-85 per cent, according to the Oxford Vaccine Group.'This is more dangerous and it's going to spread further. And I must level with you and the British public: more families, many more families, are going to lose loved ones before their time,' he said. Despite the bloodcurdling warnings, Mr Johnson said the UK would not close schools yet even though government advisers admitted the move would help stem the outbreak. Advisers said the length of closure necessary to make the measure work could be more than 16 weeks and would at this stage therefore not be feasible. Chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance said it was not realistic to expect children to be cooped up that long. He said: 'It is true that there is some effect in closing schools but that effect is minimal and actually you would have to do it for 13 to 16 weeks or longer.'You do not have to be a very advanced mathematician to work out that the chances of keeping children not speaking to each other or playing with each other are zero.'Closing down schools could also put elderly grandparents at risk if they were asked to look after children, who are believed to be less susceptible to the most severe form of the disease but can still spread it.'The scientific advice is that this could do more harm than good,' Mr Johnson said. 'But we are keeping this under review and this could change as the disease spreads. Schools should only close if they are specifically advised to do so.'Mr Johnson conceded that Scotland was already banning mass gatherings, but suggested there was a 'particular issue with the resilience of their public services' north of the border, in a perceived swipe at Nicola Sturgeon after she undermined him by announcing her plans first.'We are not saying no to that sort of measures, of course not,' Mr Johnson said. 'We are keeping it up our sleeves. But it is very important... that we get the timing right.' [item name=video id=4183030 style=2 /]'Sleep alone, don't go for a walk and don't shake your dirty laundry': Government issues advice for people self-isolating   The Government issued a how-to guide for people forced to quarantine this afternoon.It came as Boris Johnson and his medical advisers said anyone with symptoms of coronavirus should stay at home for seven days. The guidance provides practical advice, including keeping away from all other human beings as much as possible.It includes: •You cannot go for a walk but you can use your own garden.•You can buy food and other supplies online but you must warn drivers to leave goods outside and do not invite them in.•Stay in a well-ventilated room with a window that can be opened.•Stay in a different room to other people you live with.•If that isn't possible stay two metres or three steps away from other people.•Sleep alone if possible.•Do not have visitors.•Use your own toothbrushes, eating and drinking utensils, dishes, drinks, towels, washcloths or bedlinen.•Use the kitchen at different times to others in the house and eat alone.•Use a dishwasher if you have one.•If you are breastfeeding, consider asking someone else to feed the baby using expressed milk in a bottle.•Bag personal waste like used tissues inside two bags and keep it away from other household waste for 72 hours before adding to refuse.•Do not shake dirty laundry; this minimises the possibility of dispersing virus through the air.•If you don't have a washing machine wait until after you isolation before going to a launderette.•Keep hydrated by drinking water.•Clean your hands frequently with soap and water for at least 20 seconds.Chief medical officer Prof Chris Whitty added: 'We need to do it at the last point it is reasonable so people maintain their energy and enthusiasm... it is important we do not ask our fellow citizens to do it for longer than makes sense.' The FTSE plunged by more than 10 per cent yesterday in response to the dramatic US announcement of a travel ban from Europe overnight, and growing global chaos. And in the latest high-profile victim of the outbreak, BT's chief executive, Philip Jansen, tested positive for COVID-19 on Thursday.'Having felt slightly unwell I decided as a precaution to be tested. As soon as the test results were known I isolated myself at home,' Jansen said in a statement. 'I've met several industry partners this week so felt it was the responsible thing to do to alert them to this fact as soon as I could.'Jansen said his symptoms seemed mild and he would work remotely over the coming week, avoiding disruption to the business of Britain's biggest telecoms group. The UK approach is increasingly at odds with that of other countries, with Ireland joining the list of those closing all schools and colleges and banning mass gatherings. In the first sign of splits within the UK, Nicola Sturgeon has declared that Scotland will also cancelling events with more than 500 people from the start of next week, saying that they take up too much time for emergency services.She admitted: 'These are not easy judgements. They are difficult and complicated.'The government has also made clear it will not follow Donald Trump's dramatic overnight move of closing the borders to travellers from mainland Europe. Instead Mr Johnson seems determined to take a limited response, asking those with a cold to self-quarantine, and urge vulnerable elderly people to stay indoors.How the UK's coronavirus 'battle plan' could unfold  CONTAIN Testing individuals reporting symptoms or returning from infected areas, isolating those who have coronavirus.Tracing how they contracted the virus, and everyone they might have come into contact with while infectious.Powers have been taken to force people into quarantine if they refuse to comply voluntarily. This stage of the UK's response has now ended.DELAY Ministers have ordered wider testing to assess prevalence in the community. Anyone with coronavirus-like symptoms is being asked to self-isolate.Sick pay provision has been bolstered to make the self-employed and low-paid workers more likely to comply. Further up the so-called 'ladder' of response options, vulnerable people could be urged to stay indoors, schools could be closed, and sports and public gatherings could be banned. Ministers say the scientific advice does not yet support that - although Ireland is closing schools, and Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon is banning gatherings of more than 500 people.The government has also rejected the US approach of barring travellers from mainland Europe for the moment. MITIGATE If the outbreak runs out of control, the NHS could cancel all non-urgent activity to focus on treating those affected.In an extreme situation, troops could be deployed to shore up the police and essential public services.Recently-retired doctors and nurses would be brought back to help plug gaps in the NHS, with many health workers expected to be infected along with regular members of the public. Former Cabinet minister Rory Stewart this afternoon accused the PM of 'smug insular complacency, warning that without quick action there could be 100,000 cases in the UK within the next 24 days.'This is at risk of becoming an example of smug insular complacency - refusing to pay any attention to what any other country is doing or the successful public health approach in Asia,' the London Mayor hopeful said. 'We should show some humility, learn from others and act now.' On another day of frantic activity by politicians and health experts around the globe: •Irish PM Leo Varadkar has declared that schools, colleges and childcare facilities are to close for two weeks;•Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon declared that she is 'minded' to cancel mass gatherings of over 500 people from the start of next week to avoid them sucking up resources for police and health workers;•The US Congress is shutting the Capitol, House and Senate office buildings to public until April 1 in reaction to coronavirus;•The Electoral Commission has called for the local and mayoral polls due in May to be postponed until the Autumn;•The UK and the EU jointly announced that face to face Brexit trade talks next week would not go ahead as planned but they could be conducted using video technology;•The FTSE 100 fell by more than 9 per cent as investors were rattled by US travel restrictions imposed by in an attempt to halt the pandemic;•The Czech Republic is closing its borders to travellers crossing from Germany and Austria and also banning the entry of foreigners coming from other risky countries to contain the coronavirus outbreak;•Norway and Lithuania are shutting down nurseries, schools and universities for at least two weeks, and Oslo has told workers to stay at least one metre apart in offices;•Labour has cancelled a conference to announce the results of its leadership contest, saying the replacement for Jeremy Corbyn will now be declared at a 'scaled back' event on April 4;•Canadian PM Justin Trudeau has self-isolated while his wife awaits the results of a coronavirus test;•The WHO warned that the travel ban announced by Mr Trump will do little to help combat coronavirus in the UK and could backfire by making people complacent;•Mr Sunak said he made 'no apology' for turning on the spending taps to counter the effects of the virus on the UK economy and society;•A Cabinet minister is awaiting the results of a coronavirus test, with four other MPs in quarantine after health minister Nadine Dorries became the first politician to be diagnosed with the disease;•Tube and transport systems were quieter than usual as the public preempted the expected advice from government on restricting social contact;•Sporting events have been called off, with golf set to be played without crowds and the tennis tour put on hold for six weeks;•Sittings in Parliament could be scaled back and the authorities are considering closing to visitors amid fears of spread on the estate.                     Early lockdown 'can cut coronavirus infections'                    Shocking charts show how the UK Government could prevent hundreds or even thousands of deaths by taking dramatic action now to fight the killer coronavirus and 'flatten the curve' of its spiralling epidemic.Prime Minister Boris Johnson decided not to move forward in Britain's fight against COVID-19, declining to close schools, send people home from work or ban large gatherings.But he is coming under intense scrutiny for refusing to budge - one frustrated scientist warned: 'Now is the time for the UK government to ban large gatherings, ask people to stop non-essential travel, recommend employers shift to home working and ramp up the response.'Official advice currently doesn't go much further than telling citizens to wash their hands even though the UK now has more cases than China did when Wuhan's 11million people were forced into lockdown.Scientists and critics are urging the Government to do more to prolong an inevitable surge in cases, saying that a spike of infections could cripple the NHS but spreading the cases over a longer period of time would 'flatten the curve' and make it easier for the nation to cope. An analysis of statistics has shown that areas that acted fast have slashed their death rates by up to eight times compared to those who react after the virus has taken hold.In South Korea, for example, an area home to 2.5million people was put into lockdown when just 204 people had been diagnosed and one had died. The country now has a death rate of just 0.8 per cent despite more than 7,800 cases.But in Italy, large-scale lockdowns were not brought in until Sunday, March 8, by which time it had more than 5,800 patients. There are now almost 12,500 and 827 deaths - a death rate of 6.6 per cent. Ms Sturgeon said this evening that Scotland was shutting down public events 'that have the potential to have an impact on our frontline emergency services'.'This is not a move that we are making because the science has told us it will have a significant impact on the spread of the virus: on the contrary, the scientists tell us it will not have a significant impact on the spread of the virus - although no significant impact does not equate to no impact at all,' she said.'But there are wider reasons that I consider and have judged that are important in reaching this decision.''Certain events, whether or not they need dedicated ambulance cover, we know that certain events have an impact on our policing and our front-line health services, accident and emergency and ambulance services.'At a time when pressure on those services is going to be considerable ... it is incumbent on government to do what we can to remove unnecessary burdens on our public services.'The decision is set to come into force the day after Rangers host Celtic in one of this weekend's Ladbrokes Premiership fixtures, with the champions currently 13 points clear of their rivals.Prof Whitty said the UK would not be introducing social distancing measures yet as it was not the right moment within the pandemic.But he warned that advice would be coming for elderly and vulnerable people to isolate themselves from social gatherings.He said: 'The next stage along we are going to want to do a package of things that are about putting social distancing around the people who are older and those with severe health conditions.'But we do not think it is appropriate to make a national recommendation for that at the moment because it is too early in the course of the epidemic.'If you think about what would happen if you prematurely put elderly or vulnerable in a situation where you're saying, we really want to cut down on your social interactions, to cut back on your contact with others, it has big practical implications for them and may lead to loneliness and other issues which are clearly very undesirable for them.'While we will need to move to that stage, we do not think this is the right moment along the pandemic to do so. But that point will come.'Eariler, Mr Johnson swiped at political leaders who do not 'follow the science'. In comments made before Mr Trump's announcement, he said many leaders were 'under a lot of pressure to be seen to act'. Asked whether the PM knew of Mr Trump's escalation in advance, Downing Street said: 'UK and US officials are in regular contact.' To fight what is now officially a global pandemic, the Budget handed hospitals a £5billion fighting fund while thousands of firms will be given a business rates holiday to help avert the risk of bankruptcy.Sick pay will be reformed to ensure that employees are not penalised for going into quarantine. In a round of interviews, Mr Sunak told the BBC: 'I make absolutely no apology for responding in the short term in scale to the immediate threat that we face from coronavirus. 'I think that's the right thing to do for the economy, we need to help businesses have a bridge to get to the other side.'His package came as the Bank of England's base rate was slashed to an historic low of just 0.25 per cent. Irish PM Leo Varadkar has declared that schools, colleges and childcare facilities are to close for two weeks.He made a live statement to the nation from Washington DC, where he is due to meet Mr Trump later as part of the annual St Patrick's Day programme of events. 'Unfortunately we must face the tragic reality that some people will die,' he said.Mr Varadkar said he was acting on fresh advice from the country's National Public Health Emergency Team.'The virus is all over the world, it will continue to spread but it can be slowed,' he said. Dr David Halpern, head of the UK's Behavioural Insights Team dubbed Britain's 'Nudge Unit' who reports directly to Mr Johnson, has suggested the 500,000 people in UK care homes or with respiratory conditions could be the only people protected.He has suggested the virus can be beaten by letting it spread through healthy people to kill it off rather than a nationwide lockdown that could allow coronavirus to rise again later in the year.Dr Halpern has revealed ministers are considering a policy of keeping high-risk groups such as the elderly or those with underlying health conditions isolated in care homes or in their own homes over the coming months.He said: 'There's going to be a point, assuming the epidemic flows and grows as it will do, where you want to cocoon, to protect those at-risk groups so they don't catch the disease.'By the time they come out of their cocooning, herd immunity has been achieved in the rest of the population'. Deputy chief medical officer Jenny Harries was asked on the BBC if 'pretty much everyone will get it eventually'.'The thing about a new virus is, of course, nobody has antibodies ready-made to it. This virus is having a field day, the desire will be to infect as many people as it can,' she said.Dr Harries said it was possible that 'up to 80 per cent of the population' could contract the virus, but added that it was a 'very high estimate'.Scottish First minister Nicola Sturgeon said it was not possible to make the virus 'go away'.'This is a serious situation. We cannot make this virus go away. It is highly likely now that significant numbers of us are going to get this virus,' she said.'The vast majority will have very mild illness and the clear focus right now is on doing everything we can to protect those who are more susceptible to serious illness, but we cannot make this go away, we need to focus on how we manage this outbreak, delay the spread and reduce the numbers infected at any one time.'Scottish Secretary Alister Jack told BBC Radio Scotland's Good Morning Scotland programme there is 'no doubt we are not going to be able to contain it for very much longer' and that efforts will now focus on delaying the spread of the virus to 'put less pressure on the NHS'. Speaking hours after world health officials declared the coronavirus a pandemic, Trump repeatedly defended his own actions and vowed the nation would prevail in countering the virus and getting treatment on the market.'We will be suspending all travel from Europe to the United States for the next 30 days,' Trump announced, in a speech from the Oval Office to the nation. 'The new rules will go into effect Friday at midnight,' he said. The move was so sudden the acting Homeland Security secretary said he would issue full guidance on how to carry it out within 48 hours.The White House said the travel restrictions would apply to foreign nationals who have visited 26 European countries - but excluding the UK and Ireland - in the past 14 days. It will not apply to US citizens, their 'immediate' family members or legal permanent residents. But confusion remained over how exactly the rules would apply and in what time zone the deadline would be introduced. Chancellor Rishi Sunak said the UK was not following the US example.'The advice we are ...",'herd_immunity,,"(34, ""but controversially the british government appears to be pursuing a policy of 'herd_immunity' - where the majority of the healthy population will get and fight off the virus so that the disease cannot be spread easily any more."")",88

Mr Stewart, who led the UK's effort to fight ebola in Africa in 2019, said: 'I think we can be very tough, and clear, [with the British public]. This is the worst pandemic we have had for 100 years.'The Government's approach is essentially defeatist. They are saying we cannot suppress this. They say there is no point in spending a huge amount of money trying to suppress this, instead they are trying to manage the increase. We are taking far too much risk. 'I think that is a dangerous thing to do. I don't think if we allow this to spread it can be managed in that way.'And when you start getting serious numbers of people dying and the terrible choices that have to be made in hospitals, people will think that paying the cost early, now, was the right thing to do'.However, Downing Street hit back and said 'we are very clear where we take our advice from' - pointing to the contributions made by the Chief Medical Officer and the government's Chief Scientific Adviser. Number 10 also said action had been taken on care homes: 'We have set out that if people have concerns about their health or any symptoms they should not be visiting care homes.' But Mr Stewart, who is running to be the next Mayor of London as an independent, added: 'I'm absolutely confident that acting early is the better option. I would be shutting all schools and banning all gatherings immediately.'I think it is too pessimistic and defeatist and we should be taking the approach seen in China and South Korea that have actually reduced the number of cases. It can be done. It requires very tough and extreme measures.'The Government questions whether the public is up for the kind of measures we have seen in other countries. I disagree, I believe the British public will do what others have done'.Debate is raging over whether the Prime Minister has gone far enough to protect the UK's 66million people from the pandemic.The official number of coronavirus cases in the UK yesterday jumped by 134 to 596 with 10 deaths - but the Government's chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance said the true number was probably up to 10,000 cases and growing rapidly. But Mr Johnson has still held off drastic measures enforced across Europe such as banning mass gatherings and closing schools, telling Britons that the most important measure remains to wash hands for 20 seconds - and told people to stay at home for seven days if they have a new persistent cough or a high temperature. A ban on flights to and from Europe - like the one announced by US President Donald Trump - was also dismissed by the Government yesterday. Asked about the decision not to cancel large gatherings yet, with 70,000 at Cheltenham for the Gold Cup today, Jeremy Hunt told the BBC's Newsnight: 'I think it is surprising and concerning that we're not doing any of it at all when we have just four weeks before we get to the stage that Italy is at.'He added: 'The issue is not whether you or I might get infected at a football match, it's who we go on to meet.' English football's leaders have taken matters in to their own hands today as players and managers fell ill, with all professional matches including the Premier League cancelled until April 3 at the earliest. [item name=video id=4183448 style=2 /][item name=video id=4183106 style=2 /][related]Italy - the world's worst-hit country after China - is in complete lockdown as the country's tally of deaths has topped 1,000 with more than 15,000 patients infected by the virus. In response to the growing threat across Europe, Ireland yesterday closed all schools, colleges and nurseries and banned gatherings of more than 500 people. Norway's Prime Minister Erna Solberg last night put the country on a footing never seen in peacetime, despite having recorded no coronavirus deaths yet. Ms Solberg took all the Irish steps as well as banning all health workers from leaving the country, and forcing anyone returning from abroad into quarantine, including the king and queen who have been on a state visit to Jordan. But controversially the British Government appears to be pursuing a policy of 'herd immunity' - where the majority of the healthy population will get and fight off the virus so that the disease cannot be spread easily any more. The elderly and ill will be 'cocooned' from the outside world to protect them for weeks or even months. Critics have warned the policy is high risk because there have been multiple reports in China of people getting it twice - and concerns from experts that coronavirus could mutate and infect hundreds of thousands again in the coming years unless there is a vaccine.In other developments today to the escalating global crisis, which has seen more than 131,000 patients across the world get infected: •A Chinese spokesman accused the US military of bringing the coronavirus to Wuhan - the Chinese city where the COVID-19 outbreak began at the end of December;•A 37-year-old US woman who beat the infection claimed she didn't suffer the tell-tale symptom of a cough and instead only had a headache and tingling arms and legs;•French President Emmanuel Macron declared the pandemic as France's worst health crisis in a century and announced schools, universities and day-care centres would be shut from Monday;•Portuguese Prime Minister Antonio Costa ordered the shut-down of schools and universities and placed limits on the number of people in nightclubs, restaurants and shopping centres at any one time;•Belgium announced the closure of all schools, restaurants, cafes and nightclubs and also banned recreational and sporting events in its fight to contain the growing epidemic;•Danish authorities called on shoppers to avoid excessive stockpiling after it closed schools and universities and suspended indoor events with more than 100 participants;•Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon revealed gatherings of 500 people or more would be stopped from Monday and school trips would be cancelled;•Germany shut nightclubs and schools after Chancellor Angela Merkel warned that up to 70 per cent of the country's population - 58million people - could contract the coronavirus;•Spain locked down four towns in Catalonia, shut schools and universities and suspended Parliament after its deputy prime minister was in self-isolation after his wife tested positive for the virus;•An Italian medical chief died of the coronavirus at the age of 67, as the death toll in the country - the centre of Europe's escalating crisis - jumped to over 1,000;•Australia's Prime Minister Scott Morrison announced the government will effectively ban 'non essential' public gatherings of more than 500 people from Monday.Sir Patrick Vallance, the UK's chief scientific adviser, has today defended the Government's approach and its lack of hardline response along the lines seen across Europe.He told Sky News: 'We've got a panel of very world leading scientists across epidemiology, mathematical modelling, virology, clinicians, and we're taking input from leading academics to try and come up with a plan that actually does what we want to do.'It doesn't mean that the others are doing something wrong, and in fact much of the advice and much of the actions, if you look at them, they are trying to achieve the same thing.'And that is to try to reduce the peak of the epidemic, flatten it and broaden it so that you don't end up with so much intense pressure on healthcare systems at one time'.He added: 'And mass gatherings of course are a place where you can potentially get infection from somebody, but the alternative is also important that if you're not at a mass gathering, you're at a small gathering, and most of the transmission of these types of viruses occur in small gatherings, not in big gatherings'. Sir Patrick insists that telling people with cold and flu-like symptoms to stay at home for a week will have an impact.He said: 'The measures that were announced, which is about self-isolation, even if you've got very mild symptoms, will mean a large number of people actually at home, being isolated because of this infection.'That's a very big measure actually, it's going to have quite a big impact across a number of households and a number of people, so I don't think that's a trivial measure at all.'And all the modelling suggests that these sorts of measures, and the other two that we discussed yesterday, the ones that have the biggest impact'.Boris Johnson yesterday branded coronavirus the 'worst public health crisis in a generation' and warned that 'many more' people are going to die - but still held off drastic measures. Mr Hunt, chair of the Commons health and social care committee, said he was also 'personally surprised that we're still allowing external visits to care homes'. The Prime Minister said it was clear the disease will continue to spread around the world and people should brace for the 'reality' of 'severe disruption' for many months.At a press conference in Westminster, Mr Johnson formally declared that the UK's tactics have shifted from 'containing' the killer disease to merely 'delaying' its inevitable spread, after he chaired a meeting of the Cobra emergency committee. The Government's new plan urges anyone with even mild coronavirus-like symptoms - a persistent cough or a fever - to quarantine themselves at home and to sleep alone if possible and stay at least two metres from relatives.The PM has also recommended all overseas school trips be cancelled while people over the age of 70 or those with pre-existing serious medical conditions have been told not to go on cruises.But he stopped short of more extreme measures such as closing schools and banning mass gatherings which have been adopted in Ireland, Norway, France and Italy in an effort to stem the spread of the virus. 'At all stages we have been guided by the science. We will do the right thing at the right time,' Mr Johnson said. The number of UK cases has risen by 130 and the death toll hit 10 in the last 24 hours, with experts increasingly bracing for turmoil as the overwhelming majority of the population becomes infected and the country develops 'herd immunity'. But chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance said he believed the true number of infections was likely to be 5,000-10,000 already. He estimated that the UK was four weeks behind the trajectory of the crisis in Italy - which has brought the country to its knees.The peak of the outbreak in the UK might not come for 10-14 weeks, the experts said - suggesting it will run into June. [item name=video id=4183034 style=2 /][item name=module id=1163133 style=153 /][item name=video id=4183922 style=2 /][item name=video id=4185768 style=2 /]Mr Johnson insisted comparisons to seasonal flu were wrong. WHAT IS HERD IMMUNITY AND WILL IT EVEN WORK?  Herd immunity is a situation in which a population of people is protected from a disease because so many of them are unaffected by it that it cannot spread. To cause an outbreak a disease-causing bacteria or virus must have a continuous supply of potential victims who are not immune to it.Immunity is when your body knows exactly how to fight off a certain type of infection because it has encountered it before, either by having the illness in the past or through a vaccine.When a virus or bacteria enters the body the immune system creates substances called antibodies, which are designed to destroy one specific type of bug.When these have been created once, some of them remain in the body and the body also remembers how to make them again. This provides long-term protection, or immunity, against an illness.If nobody is immune to an illness - as was the case at the beginning of the coronavirus outbreak - it can spread like wildfire.However, if, for example, half of people have developed immunity - from a past infection or a vaccine - there are only half as many people the illness can spread to.As more and more people become immune the bug finds it harder and harder to spread until its pool of victims becomes so small it can no longer spread at all.The threshold for herd immunity is different for various illnesses, depending on how contagious they are - for measles, around 95 per cent of people must be vaccinated to it spreading.For polio, which is less contagious, the threshold is about 80-85 per cent, according to the Oxford Vaccine Group.'This is more dangerous and it's going to spread further. And I must level with you and the British public: more families, many more families, are going to lose loved ones before their time,' he said. Despite the bloodcurdling warnings, Mr Johnson said the UK would not close schools yet even though government advisers admitted the move would help stem the outbreak. Advisers said the length of closure necessary to make the measure work could be more than 16 weeks and would at this stage therefore not be feasible. Chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance said it was not realistic to expect children to be cooped up that long. He said: 'It is true that there is some effect in closing schools but that effect is minimal and actually you would have to do it for 13 to 16 weeks or longer.'You do not have to be a very advanced mathematician to work out that the chances of keeping children not speaking to each other or playing with each other are zero.'Closing down schools could also put elderly grandparents at risk if they were asked to look after children, who are believed to be less susceptible to the most severe form of the disease but can still spread it.'The scientific advice is that this could do more harm than good,' Mr Johnson said. 'But we are keeping this under review and this could change as the disease spreads. Schools should only close if they are specifically advised to do so.'Mr Johnson conceded that Scotland was already banning mass gatherings, but suggested there was a 'particular issue with the resilience of their public services' north of the border, in a perceived swipe at Nicola Sturgeon after she undermined him by announcing her plans first.'We are not saying no to that sort of measures, of course not,' Mr Johnson said. 'We are keeping it up our sleeves. But it is very important... that we get the timing right.' [item name=video id=4183030 style=2 /]'Sleep alone, don't go for a walk and don't shake your dirty laundry': Government issues advice for people self-isolating   The Government issued a how-to guide for people forced to quarantine this afternoon.It came as Boris Johnson and his medical advisers said anyone with symptoms of coronavirus should stay at home for seven days. The guidance provides practical advice, including keeping away from all other human beings as much as possible.It includes: •You cannot go for a walk but you can use your own garden.•You can buy food and other supplies online but you must warn drivers to leave goods outside and do not invite them in.•Stay in a well-ventilated room with a window that can be opened.•Stay in a different room to other people you live with.•If that isn't possible stay two metres or three steps away from other people.•Sleep alone if possible.•Do not have visitors.•Use your own toothbrushes, eating and drinking utensils, dishes, drinks, towels, washcloths or bedlinen.•Use the kitchen at different times to others in the house and eat alone.•Use a dishwasher if you have one.•If you are breastfeeding, consider asking someone else to feed the baby using expressed milk in a bottle.•Bag personal waste like used tissues inside two bags and keep it away from other household waste for 72 hours before adding to refuse.•Do not shake dirty laundry; this minimises the possibility of dispersing virus through the air.•If you don't have a washing machine wait until after you isolation before going to a launderette.•Keep hydrated by drinking water.•Clean your hands frequently with soap and water for at least 20 seconds.Chief medical officer Prof Chris Whitty added: 'We need to do it at the last point it is reasonable so people maintain their energy and enthusiasm... it is important we do not ask our fellow citizens to do it for longer than makes sense.' The FTSE plunged by more than 10 per cent yesterday in response to the dramatic US announcement of a travel ban from Europe overnight, and growing global chaos. And in the latest high-profile victim of the outbreak, BT's chief executive, Philip Jansen, tested positive for COVID-19 on Thursday.'Having felt slightly unwell I decided as a precaution to be tested. As soon as the test results were known I isolated myself at home,' Jansen said in a statement. 'I've met several industry partners this week so felt it was the responsible thing to do to alert them to this fact as soon as I could.'Jansen said his symptoms seemed mild and he would work remotely over the coming week, avoiding disruption to the business of Britain's biggest telecoms group. The UK approach is increasingly at odds with that of other countries, with Ireland joining the list of those closing all schools and colleges and banning mass gatherings. In the first sign of splits within the UK, Nicola Sturgeon has declared that Scotland will also cancelling events with more than 500 people from the start of next week, saying that they take up too much time for emergency services.She admitted: 'These are not easy judgements. They are difficult and complicated.'The government has also made clear it will not follow Donald Trump's dramatic overnight move of closing the borders to travellers from mainland Europe. Instead Mr Johnson seems determined to take a limited response, asking those with a cold to self-quarantine, and urge vulnerable elderly people to stay indoors.How the UK's coronavirus 'battle plan' could unfold  CONTAIN Testing individuals reporting symptoms or returning from infected areas, isolating those who have coronavirus.Tracing how they contracted the virus, and everyone they might have come into contact with while infectious.Powers have been taken to force people into quarantine if they refuse to comply voluntarily. This stage of the UK's response has now ended.DELAY Ministers have ordered wider testing to assess prevalence in the community. Anyone with coronavirus-like symptoms is being asked to self-isolate.Sick pay provision has been bolstered to make the self-employed and low-paid workers more likely to comply. Further up the so-called 'ladder' of response options, vulnerable people could be urged to stay indoors, schools could be closed, and sports and public gatherings could be banned. Ministers say the scientific advice does not yet support that - although Ireland is closing schools, and Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon is banning gatherings of more than 500 people.The government has also rejected the US approach of barring travellers from mainland Europe for the moment. MITIGATE If the outbreak runs out of control, the NHS could cancel all non-urgent activity to focus on treating those affected.In an extreme situation, troops could be deployed to shore up the police and essential public services.Recently-retired doctors and nurses would be brought back to help plug gaps in the NHS, with many health workers expected to be infected along with regular members of the public. Former Cabinet minister Rory Stewart this afternoon accused the PM of 'smug insular complacency, warning that without quick action there could be 100,000 cases in the UK within the next 24 days.'This is at risk of becoming an example of smug insular complacency - refusing to pay any attention to what any other country is doing or the successful public health approach in Asia,' the London Mayor hopeful said. 'We should show some humility, learn from others and act now.' On another day of frantic activity by politicians and health experts around the globe: •Irish PM Leo Varadkar has declared that schools, colleges and childcare facilities are to close for two weeks;•Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon declared that she is 'minded' to cancel mass gatherings of over 500 people from the start of next week to avoid them sucking up resources for police and health workers;•The US Congress is shutting the Capitol, House and Senate office buildings to public until April 1 in reaction to coronavirus;•The Electoral Commission has called for the local and mayoral polls due in May to be postponed until the Autumn;•The UK and the EU jointly announced that face to face Brexit trade talks next week would not go ahead as planned but they could be conducted using video technology;•The FTSE 100 fell by more than 9 per cent as investors were rattled by US travel restrictions imposed by in an attempt to halt the pandemic;•The Czech Republic is closing its borders to travellers crossing from Germany and Austria and also banning the entry of foreigners coming from other risky countries to contain the coronavirus outbreak;•Norway and Lithuania are shutting down nurseries, schools and universities for at least two weeks, and Oslo has told workers to stay at least one metre apart in offices;•Labour has cancelled a conference to announce the results of its leadership contest, saying the replacement for Jeremy Corbyn will now be declared at a 'scaled back' event on April 4;•Canadian PM Justin Trudeau has self-isolated while his wife awaits the results of a coronavirus test;•The WHO warned that the travel ban announced by Mr Trump will do little to help combat coronavirus in the UK and could backfire by making people complacent;•Mr Sunak said he made 'no apology' for turning on the spending taps to counter the effects of the virus on the UK economy and society;•A Cabinet minister is awaiting the results of a coronavirus test, with four other MPs in quarantine after health minister Nadine Dorries became the first politician to be diagnosed with the disease;•Tube and transport systems were quieter than usual as the public preempted the expected advice from government on restricting social contact;•Sporting events have been called off, with golf set to be played without crowds and the tennis tour put on hold for six weeks;•Sittings in Parliament could be scaled back and the authorities are considering closing to visitors amid fears of spread on the estate.                     Early lockdown 'can cut coronavirus infections'                    Shocking charts show how the UK Government could prevent hundreds or even thousands of deaths by taking dramatic action now to fight the killer coronavirus and 'flatten the curve' of its spiralling epidemic.Prime Minister Boris Johnson decided not to move forward in Britain's fight against COVID-19, declining to close schools, send people home from work or ban large gatherings.But he is coming under intense scrutiny for refusing to budge - one frustrated scientist warned: 'Now is the time for the UK government to ban large gatherings, ask people to stop non-essential travel, recommend employers shift to home working and ramp up the response.'Official advice currently doesn't go much further than telling citizens to wash their hands even though the UK now has more cases than China did when Wuhan's 11million people were forced into lockdown.Scientists and critics are urging the Government to do more to prolong an inevitable surge in cases, saying that a spike of infections could cripple the NHS but spreading the cases over a longer period of time would 'flatten the curve' and make it easier for the nation to cope. An analysis of statistics has shown that areas that acted fast have slashed their death rates by up to eight times compared to those who react after the virus has taken hold.In South Korea, for example, an area home to 2.5million people was put into lockdown when just 204 people had been diagnosed and one had died. The country now has a death rate of just 0.8 per cent despite more than 7,800 cases.But in Italy, large-scale lockdowns were not brought in until Sunday, March 8, by which time it had more than 5,800 patients. There are now almost 12,500 and 827 deaths - a death rate of 6.6 per cent. Ms Sturgeon said this evening that Scotland was shutting down public events 'that have the potential to have an impact on our frontline emergency services'.'This is not a move that we are making because the science has told us it will have a significant impact on the spread of the virus: on the contrary, the scientists tell us it will not have a significant impact on the spread of the virus - although no significant impact does not equate to no impact at all,' she said.'But there are wider reasons that I consider and have judged that are important in reaching this decision.''Certain events, whether or not they need dedicated ambulance cover, we know that certain events have an impact on our policing and our front-line health services, accident and emergency and ambulance services.'At a time when pressure on those services is going to be considerable ... it is incumbent on government to do what we can to remove unnecessary burdens on our public services.'The decision is set to come into force the day after Rangers host Celtic in one of this weekend's Ladbrokes Premiership fixtures, with the champions currently 13 points clear of their rivals.Prof Whitty said the UK would not be introducing social distancing measures yet as it was not the right moment within the pandemic.But he warned that advice would be coming for elderly and vulnerable people to isolate themselves from social gatherings.He said: 'The next stage along we are going to want to do a package of things that are about putting social distancing around the people who are older and those with severe health conditions.'But we do not think it is appropriate to make a national recommendation for that at the moment because it is too early in the course of the epidemic.'If you think about what would happen if you prematurely put elderly or vulnerable in a situation where you're saying, we really want to cut down on your social interactions, to cut back on your contact with others, it has big practical implications for them and may lead to loneliness and other issues which are clearly very undesirable for them.'While we will need to move to that stage, we do not think this is the right moment along the pandemic to do so. But that point will come.'Eariler, Mr Johnson swiped at political leaders who do not 'follow the science'. In comments made before Mr Trump's announcement, he said many leaders were 'under a lot of pressure to be seen to act'. Asked whether the PM knew of Mr Trump's escalation in advance, Downing Street said: 'UK and US officials are in regular contact.' To fight what is now officially a global pandemic, the Budget handed hospitals a £5billion fighting fund while thousands of firms will be given a business rates holiday to help avert the risk of bankruptcy.Sick pay will be reformed to ensure that employees are not penalised for going into quarantine. In a round of interviews, Mr Sunak told the BBC: 'I make absolutely no apology for responding in the short term in scale to the immediate threat that we face from coronavirus. 'I think that's the right thing to do for the economy, we need to help businesses have a bridge to get to the other side.'His package came as the Bank of England's base rate was slashed to an historic low of just 0.25 per cent. Irish PM Leo Varadkar has declared that schools, colleges and childcare facilities are to close for two weeks.He made a live statement to the nation from Washington DC, where he is due to meet Mr Trump later as part of the annual St Patrick's Day programme of events. 'Unfortunately we must face the tragic reality that some people will die,' he said.Mr Varadkar said he was acting on fresh advice from the country's National Public Health Emergency Team.'The virus is all over the world, it will continue to spread but it can be slowed,' he said. Dr David Halpern, head of the UK's Behavioural Insights Team dubbed Britain's 'Nudge Unit' who reports directly to Mr Johnson, has suggested the 500,000 people in UK care homes or with respiratory conditions could be the only people protected.He has suggested the virus can be beaten by letting it spread through healthy people to kill it off rather than a nationwide lockdown that could allow coronavirus to rise again later in the year.Dr Halpern has revealed ministers are considering a policy of keeping high-risk groups such as the elderly or those with underlying health conditions isolated in care homes or in their own homes over the coming months.He said: 'There's going to be a point, assuming the epidemic flows and grows as it will do, where you want to cocoon, to protect those at-risk groups so they don't catch the disease.'By the time they come out of their cocooning, herd immunity has been achieved in the rest of the population'. Deputy chief medical officer Jenny Harries was asked on the BBC if 'pretty much everyone will get it eventually'.'The thing about a new virus is, of course, nobody has antibodies ready-made to it. This virus is having a field day, the desire will be to infect as many people as it can,' she said.Dr Harries said it was possible that 'up to 80 per cent of the population' could contract the virus, but added that it was a 'very high estimate'.Scottish First minister Nicola Sturgeon said it was not possible to make the virus 'go away'.'This is a serious situation. We cannot make this virus go away. It is highly likely now that significant numbers of us are going to get this virus,' she said.'The vast majority will have very mild illness and the clear focus right now is on doing everything we can to protect those who are more susceptible to serious illness, but we cannot make this go away, we need to focus on how we manage this outbreak, delay the spread and reduce the numbers infected at any one time.'Scottish Secretary Alister Jack told BBC Radio Scotland's Good Morning Scotland programme there is 'no doubt we are not going to be able to contain it for very much longer' and that efforts will now focus on delaying the spread of the virus to 'put less pressure on the NHS'. Speaking hours after world health officials declared the coronavirus a pandemic, Trump repeatedly defended his own actions and vowed the nation would prevail in countering the virus and getting treatment on the market.'We will be suspending all travel from Europe to the United States for the next 30 days,' Trump announced, in a speech from the Oval Office to the nation. 'The new rules will go into effect Friday at midnight,' he said. The move was so sudden the acting Homeland Security secretary said he would issue full guidance on how to carry it out within 48 hours.The White House said the travel restrictions would apply to foreign nationals who have visited 26 European countries - but excluding the UK and Ireland - in the past 14 days. It will not apply to US citizens, their 'immediate' family members or legal permanent residents. But confusion remained over how exactly the rules would apply and in what time zone the deadline would be introduced. Chancellor Rishi Sunak said the UK was not following the US example.'The advice we are ...",'herd_immunity,,"(56, ""the number of uk cases has risen by 130 and the death toll hit 10 in the last 24 hours, with experts increasingly bracing for turmoil as the overwhelming majority of the population becomes infected and the country develops 'herd_immunity'."")",89

Mr Stewart, who led the UK's effort to fight ebola in Africa in 2019, said: 'I think we can be very tough, and clear, [with the British public]. This is the worst pandemic we have had for 100 years.'The Government's approach is essentially defeatist. They are saying we cannot suppress this. They say there is no point in spending a huge amount of money trying to suppress this, instead they are trying to manage the increase. We are taking far too much risk. 'I think that is a dangerous thing to do. I don't think if we allow this to spread it can be managed in that way.'And when you start getting serious numbers of people dying and the terrible choices that have to be made in hospitals, people will think that paying the cost early, now, was the right thing to do'.However, Downing Street hit back and said 'we are very clear where we take our advice from' - pointing to the contributions made by the Chief Medical Officer and the government's Chief Scientific Adviser. Number 10 also said action had been taken on care homes: 'We have set out that if people have concerns about their health or any symptoms they should not be visiting care homes.' But Mr Stewart, who is running to be the next Mayor of London as an independent, added: 'I'm absolutely confident that acting early is the better option. I would be shutting all schools and banning all gatherings immediately.'I think it is too pessimistic and defeatist and we should be taking the approach seen in China and South Korea that have actually reduced the number of cases. It can be done. It requires very tough and extreme measures.'The Government questions whether the public is up for the kind of measures we have seen in other countries. I disagree, I believe the British public will do what others have done'.Debate is raging over whether the Prime Minister has gone far enough to protect the UK's 66million people from the pandemic.The official number of coronavirus cases in the UK yesterday jumped by 134 to 596 with 10 deaths - but the Government's chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance said the true number was probably up to 10,000 cases and growing rapidly. But Mr Johnson has still held off drastic measures enforced across Europe such as banning mass gatherings and closing schools, telling Britons that the most important measure remains to wash hands for 20 seconds - and told people to stay at home for seven days if they have a new persistent cough or a high temperature. A ban on flights to and from Europe - like the one announced by US President Donald Trump - was also dismissed by the Government yesterday. Asked about the decision not to cancel large gatherings yet, with 70,000 at Cheltenham for the Gold Cup today, Jeremy Hunt told the BBC's Newsnight: 'I think it is surprising and concerning that we're not doing any of it at all when we have just four weeks before we get to the stage that Italy is at.'He added: 'The issue is not whether you or I might get infected at a football match, it's who we go on to meet.' English football's leaders have taken matters in to their own hands today as players and managers fell ill, with all professional matches including the Premier League cancelled until April 3 at the earliest. [item name=video id=4183448 style=2 /][item name=video id=4183106 style=2 /][related]Italy - the world's worst-hit country after China - is in complete lockdown as the country's tally of deaths has topped 1,000 with more than 15,000 patients infected by the virus. In response to the growing threat across Europe, Ireland yesterday closed all schools, colleges and nurseries and banned gatherings of more than 500 people. Norway's Prime Minister Erna Solberg last night put the country on a footing never seen in peacetime, despite having recorded no coronavirus deaths yet. Ms Solberg took all the Irish steps as well as banning all health workers from leaving the country, and forcing anyone returning from abroad into quarantine, including the king and queen who have been on a state visit to Jordan. But controversially the British Government appears to be pursuing a policy of 'herd immunity' - where the majority of the healthy population will get and fight off the virus so that the disease cannot be spread easily any more. The elderly and ill will be 'cocooned' from the outside world to protect them for weeks or even months. Critics have warned the policy is high risk because there have been multiple reports in China of people getting it twice - and concerns from experts that coronavirus could mutate and infect hundreds of thousands again in the coming years unless there is a vaccine.In other developments today to the escalating global crisis, which has seen more than 131,000 patients across the world get infected: •A Chinese spokesman accused the US military of bringing the coronavirus to Wuhan - the Chinese city where the COVID-19 outbreak began at the end of December;•A 37-year-old US woman who beat the infection claimed she didn't suffer the tell-tale symptom of a cough and instead only had a headache and tingling arms and legs;•French President Emmanuel Macron declared the pandemic as France's worst health crisis in a century and announced schools, universities and day-care centres would be shut from Monday;•Portuguese Prime Minister Antonio Costa ordered the shut-down of schools and universities and placed limits on the number of people in nightclubs, restaurants and shopping centres at any one time;•Belgium announced the closure of all schools, restaurants, cafes and nightclubs and also banned recreational and sporting events in its fight to contain the growing epidemic;•Danish authorities called on shoppers to avoid excessive stockpiling after it closed schools and universities and suspended indoor events with more than 100 participants;•Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon revealed gatherings of 500 people or more would be stopped from Monday and school trips would be cancelled;•Germany shut nightclubs and schools after Chancellor Angela Merkel warned that up to 70 per cent of the country's population - 58million people - could contract the coronavirus;•Spain locked down four towns in Catalonia, shut schools and universities and suspended Parliament after its deputy prime minister was in self-isolation after his wife tested positive for the virus;•An Italian medical chief died of the coronavirus at the age of 67, as the death toll in the country - the centre of Europe's escalating crisis - jumped to over 1,000;•Australia's Prime Minister Scott Morrison announced the government will effectively ban 'non essential' public gatherings of more than 500 people from Monday.Sir Patrick Vallance, the UK's chief scientific adviser, has today defended the Government's approach and its lack of hardline response along the lines seen across Europe.He told Sky News: 'We've got a panel of very world leading scientists across epidemiology, mathematical modelling, virology, clinicians, and we're taking input from leading academics to try and come up with a plan that actually does what we want to do.'It doesn't mean that the others are doing something wrong, and in fact much of the advice and much of the actions, if you look at them, they are trying to achieve the same thing.'And that is to try to reduce the peak of the epidemic, flatten it and broaden it so that you don't end up with so much intense pressure on healthcare systems at one time'.He added: 'And mass gatherings of course are a place where you can potentially get infection from somebody, but the alternative is also important that if you're not at a mass gathering, you're at a small gathering, and most of the transmission of these types of viruses occur in small gatherings, not in big gatherings'. Sir Patrick insists that telling people with cold and flu-like symptoms to stay at home for a week will have an impact.He said: 'The measures that were announced, which is about self-isolation, even if you've got very mild symptoms, will mean a large number of people actually at home, being isolated because of this infection.'That's a very big measure actually, it's going to have quite a big impact across a number of households and a number of people, so I don't think that's a trivial measure at all.'And all the modelling suggests that these sorts of measures, and the other two that we discussed yesterday, the ones that have the biggest impact'.Boris Johnson yesterday branded coronavirus the 'worst public health crisis in a generation' and warned that 'many more' people are going to die - but still held off drastic measures. Mr Hunt, chair of the Commons health and social care committee, said he was also 'personally surprised that we're still allowing external visits to care homes'. The Prime Minister said it was clear the disease will continue to spread around the world and people should brace for the 'reality' of 'severe disruption' for many months.At a press conference in Westminster, Mr Johnson formally declared that the UK's tactics have shifted from 'containing' the killer disease to merely 'delaying' its inevitable spread, after he chaired a meeting of the Cobra emergency committee. The Government's new plan urges anyone with even mild coronavirus-like symptoms - a persistent cough or a fever - to quarantine themselves at home and to sleep alone if possible and stay at least two metres from relatives.The PM has also recommended all overseas school trips be cancelled while people over the age of 70 or those with pre-existing serious medical conditions have been told not to go on cruises.But he stopped short of more extreme measures such as closing schools and banning mass gatherings which have been adopted in Ireland, Norway, France and Italy in an effort to stem the spread of the virus. 'At all stages we have been guided by the science. We will do the right thing at the right time,' Mr Johnson said. The number of UK cases has risen by 130 and the death toll hit 10 in the last 24 hours, with experts increasingly bracing for turmoil as the overwhelming majority of the population becomes infected and the country develops 'herd immunity'. But chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance said he believed the true number of infections was likely to be 5,000-10,000 already. He estimated that the UK was four weeks behind the trajectory of the crisis in Italy - which has brought the country to its knees.The peak of the outbreak in the UK might not come for 10-14 weeks, the experts said - suggesting it will run into June. [item name=video id=4183034 style=2 /][item name=module id=1163133 style=153 /][item name=video id=4183922 style=2 /][item name=video id=4185768 style=2 /]Mr Johnson insisted comparisons to seasonal flu were wrong. WHAT IS HERD IMMUNITY AND WILL IT EVEN WORK?  Herd immunity is a situation in which a population of people is protected from a disease because so many of them are unaffected by it that it cannot spread. To cause an outbreak a disease-causing bacteria or virus must have a continuous supply of potential victims who are not immune to it.Immunity is when your body knows exactly how to fight off a certain type of infection because it has encountered it before, either by having the illness in the past or through a vaccine.When a virus or bacteria enters the body the immune system creates substances called antibodies, which are designed to destroy one specific type of bug.When these have been created once, some of them remain in the body and the body also remembers how to make them again. This provides long-term protection, or immunity, against an illness.If nobody is immune to an illness - as was the case at the beginning of the coronavirus outbreak - it can spread like wildfire.However, if, for example, half of people have developed immunity - from a past infection or a vaccine - there are only half as many people the illness can spread to.As more and more people become immune the bug finds it harder and harder to spread until its pool of victims becomes so small it can no longer spread at all.The threshold for herd immunity is different for various illnesses, depending on how contagious they are - for measles, around 95 per cent of people must be vaccinated to it spreading.For polio, which is less contagious, the threshold is about 80-85 per cent, according to the Oxford Vaccine Group.'This is more dangerous and it's going to spread further. And I must level with you and the British public: more families, many more families, are going to lose loved ones before their time,' he said. Despite the bloodcurdling warnings, Mr Johnson said the UK would not close schools yet even though government advisers admitted the move would help stem the outbreak. Advisers said the length of closure necessary to make the measure work could be more than 16 weeks and would at this stage therefore not be feasible. Chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance said it was not realistic to expect children to be cooped up that long. He said: 'It is true that there is some effect in closing schools but that effect is minimal and actually you would have to do it for 13 to 16 weeks or longer.'You do not have to be a very advanced mathematician to work out that the chances of keeping children not speaking to each other or playing with each other are zero.'Closing down schools could also put elderly grandparents at risk if they were asked to look after children, who are believed to be less susceptible to the most severe form of the disease but can still spread it.'The scientific advice is that this could do more harm than good,' Mr Johnson said. 'But we are keeping this under review and this could change as the disease spreads. Schools should only close if they are specifically advised to do so.'Mr Johnson conceded that Scotland was already banning mass gatherings, but suggested there was a 'particular issue with the resilience of their public services' north of the border, in a perceived swipe at Nicola Sturgeon after she undermined him by announcing her plans first.'We are not saying no to that sort of measures, of course not,' Mr Johnson said. 'We are keeping it up our sleeves. But it is very important... that we get the timing right.' [item name=video id=4183030 style=2 /]'Sleep alone, don't go for a walk and don't shake your dirty laundry': Government issues advice for people self-isolating   The Government issued a how-to guide for people forced to quarantine this afternoon.It came as Boris Johnson and his medical advisers said anyone with symptoms of coronavirus should stay at home for seven days. The guidance provides practical advice, including keeping away from all other human beings as much as possible.It includes: •You cannot go for a walk but you can use your own garden.•You can buy food and other supplies online but you must warn drivers to leave goods outside and do not invite them in.•Stay in a well-ventilated room with a window that can be opened.•Stay in a different room to other people you live with.•If that isn't possible stay two metres or three steps away from other people.•Sleep alone if possible.•Do not have visitors.•Use your own toothbrushes, eating and drinking utensils, dishes, drinks, towels, washcloths or bedlinen.•Use the kitchen at different times to others in the house and eat alone.•Use a dishwasher if you have one.•If you are breastfeeding, consider asking someone else to feed the baby using expressed milk in a bottle.•Bag personal waste like used tissues inside two bags and keep it away from other household waste for 72 hours before adding to refuse.•Do not shake dirty laundry; this minimises the possibility of dispersing virus through the air.•If you don't have a washing machine wait until after you isolation before going to a launderette.•Keep hydrated by drinking water.•Clean your hands frequently with soap and water for at least 20 seconds.Chief medical officer Prof Chris Whitty added: 'We need to do it at the last point it is reasonable so people maintain their energy and enthusiasm... it is important we do not ask our fellow citizens to do it for longer than makes sense.' The FTSE plunged by more than 10 per cent yesterday in response to the dramatic US announcement of a travel ban from Europe overnight, and growing global chaos. And in the latest high-profile victim of the outbreak, BT's chief executive, Philip Jansen, tested positive for COVID-19 on Thursday.'Having felt slightly unwell I decided as a precaution to be tested. As soon as the test results were known I isolated myself at home,' Jansen said in a statement. 'I've met several industry partners this week so felt it was the responsible thing to do to alert them to this fact as soon as I could.'Jansen said his symptoms seemed mild and he would work remotely over the coming week, avoiding disruption to the business of Britain's biggest telecoms group. The UK approach is increasingly at odds with that of other countries, with Ireland joining the list of those closing all schools and colleges and banning mass gatherings. In the first sign of splits within the UK, Nicola Sturgeon has declared that Scotland will also cancelling events with more than 500 people from the start of next week, saying that they take up too much time for emergency services.She admitted: 'These are not easy judgements. They are difficult and complicated.'The government has also made clear it will not follow Donald Trump's dramatic overnight move of closing the borders to travellers from mainland Europe. Instead Mr Johnson seems determined to take a limited response, asking those with a cold to self-quarantine, and urge vulnerable elderly people to stay indoors.How the UK's coronavirus 'battle plan' could unfold  CONTAIN Testing individuals reporting symptoms or returning from infected areas, isolating those who have coronavirus.Tracing how they contracted the virus, and everyone they might have come into contact with while infectious.Powers have been taken to force people into quarantine if they refuse to comply voluntarily. This stage of the UK's response has now ended.DELAY Ministers have ordered wider testing to assess prevalence in the community. Anyone with coronavirus-like symptoms is being asked to self-isolate.Sick pay provision has been bolstered to make the self-employed and low-paid workers more likely to comply. Further up the so-called 'ladder' of response options, vulnerable people could be urged to stay indoors, schools could be closed, and sports and public gatherings could be banned. Ministers say the scientific advice does not yet support that - although Ireland is closing schools, and Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon is banning gatherings of more than 500 people.The government has also rejected the US approach of barring travellers from mainland Europe for the moment. MITIGATE If the outbreak runs out of control, the NHS could cancel all non-urgent activity to focus on treating those affected.In an extreme situation, troops could be deployed to shore up the police and essential public services.Recently-retired doctors and nurses would be brought back to help plug gaps in the NHS, with many health workers expected to be infected along with regular members of the public. Former Cabinet minister Rory Stewart this afternoon accused the PM of 'smug insular complacency, warning that without quick action there could be 100,000 cases in the UK within the next 24 days.'This is at risk of becoming an example of smug insular complacency - refusing to pay any attention to what any other country is doing or the successful public health approach in Asia,' the London Mayor hopeful said. 'We should show some humility, learn from others and act now.' On another day of frantic activity by politicians and health experts around the globe: •Irish PM Leo Varadkar has declared that schools, colleges and childcare facilities are to close for two weeks;•Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon declared that she is 'minded' to cancel mass gatherings of over 500 people from the start of next week to avoid them sucking up resources for police and health workers;•The US Congress is shutting the Capitol, House and Senate office buildings to public until April 1 in reaction to coronavirus;•The Electoral Commission has called for the local and mayoral polls due in May to be postponed until the Autumn;•The UK and the EU jointly announced that face to face Brexit trade talks next week would not go ahead as planned but they could be conducted using video technology;•The FTSE 100 fell by more than 9 per cent as investors were rattled by US travel restrictions imposed by in an attempt to halt the pandemic;•The Czech Republic is closing its borders to travellers crossing from Germany and Austria and also banning the entry of foreigners coming from other risky countries to contain the coronavirus outbreak;•Norway and Lithuania are shutting down nurseries, schools and universities for at least two weeks, and Oslo has told workers to stay at least one metre apart in offices;•Labour has cancelled a conference to announce the results of its leadership contest, saying the replacement for Jeremy Corbyn will now be declared at a 'scaled back' event on April 4;•Canadian PM Justin Trudeau has self-isolated while his wife awaits the results of a coronavirus test;•The WHO warned that the travel ban announced by Mr Trump will do little to help combat coronavirus in the UK and could backfire by making people complacent;•Mr Sunak said he made 'no apology' for turning on the spending taps to counter the effects of the virus on the UK economy and society;•A Cabinet minister is awaiting the results of a coronavirus test, with four other MPs in quarantine after health minister Nadine Dorries became the first politician to be diagnosed with the disease;•Tube and transport systems were quieter than usual as the public preempted the expected advice from government on restricting social contact;•Sporting events have been called off, with golf set to be played without crowds and the tennis tour put on hold for six weeks;•Sittings in Parliament could be scaled back and the authorities are considering closing to visitors amid fears of spread on the estate.                     Early lockdown 'can cut coronavirus infections'                    Shocking charts show how the UK Government could prevent hundreds or even thousands of deaths by taking dramatic action now to fight the killer coronavirus and 'flatten the curve' of its spiralling epidemic.Prime Minister Boris Johnson decided not to move forward in Britain's fight against COVID-19, declining to close schools, send people home from work or ban large gatherings.But he is coming under intense scrutiny for refusing to budge - one frustrated scientist warned: 'Now is the time for the UK government to ban large gatherings, ask people to stop non-essential travel, recommend employers shift to home working and ramp up the response.'Official advice currently doesn't go much further than telling citizens to wash their hands even though the UK now has more cases than China did when Wuhan's 11million people were forced into lockdown.Scientists and critics are urging the Government to do more to prolong an inevitable surge in cases, saying that a spike of infections could cripple the NHS but spreading the cases over a longer period of time would 'flatten the curve' and make it easier for the nation to cope. An analysis of statistics has shown that areas that acted fast have slashed their death rates by up to eight times compared to those who react after the virus has taken hold.In South Korea, for example, an area home to 2.5million people was put into lockdown when just 204 people had been diagnosed and one had died. The country now has a death rate of just 0.8 per cent despite more than 7,800 cases.But in Italy, large-scale lockdowns were not brought in until Sunday, March 8, by which time it had more than 5,800 patients. There are now almost 12,500 and 827 deaths - a death rate of 6.6 per cent. Ms Sturgeon said this evening that Scotland was shutting down public events 'that have the potential to have an impact on our frontline emergency services'.'This is not a move that we are making because the science has told us it will have a significant impact on the spread of the virus: on the contrary, the scientists tell us it will not have a significant impact on the spread of the virus - although no significant impact does not equate to no impact at all,' she said.'But there are wider reasons that I consider and have judged that are important in reaching this decision.''Certain events, whether or not they need dedicated ambulance cover, we know that certain events have an impact on our policing and our front-line health services, accident and emergency and ambulance services.'At a time when pressure on those services is going to be considerable ... it is incumbent on government to do what we can to remove unnecessary burdens on our public services.'The decision is set to come into force the day after Rangers host Celtic in one of this weekend's Ladbrokes Premiership fixtures, with the champions currently 13 points clear of their rivals.Prof Whitty said the UK would not be introducing social distancing measures yet as it was not the right moment within the pandemic.But he warned that advice would be coming for elderly and vulnerable people to isolate themselves from social gatherings.He said: 'The next stage along we are going to want to do a package of things that are about putting social distancing around the people who are older and those with severe health conditions.'But we do not think it is appropriate to make a national recommendation for that at the moment because it is too early in the course of the epidemic.'If you think about what would happen if you prematurely put elderly or vulnerable in a situation where you're saying, we really want to cut down on your social interactions, to cut back on your contact with others, it has big practical implications for them and may lead to loneliness and other issues which are clearly very undesirable for them.'While we will need to move to that stage, we do not think this is the right moment along the pandemic to do so. But that point will come.'Eariler, Mr Johnson swiped at political leaders who do not 'follow the science'. In comments made before Mr Trump's announcement, he said many leaders were 'under a lot of pressure to be seen to act'. Asked whether the PM knew of Mr Trump's escalation in advance, Downing Street said: 'UK and US officials are in regular contact.' To fight what is now officially a global pandemic, the Budget handed hospitals a £5billion fighting fund while thousands of firms will be given a business rates holiday to help avert the risk of bankruptcy.Sick pay will be reformed to ensure that employees are not penalised for going into quarantine. In a round of interviews, Mr Sunak told the BBC: 'I make absolutely no apology for responding in the short term in scale to the immediate threat that we face from coronavirus. 'I think that's the right thing to do for the economy, we need to help businesses have a bridge to get to the other side.'His package came as the Bank of England's base rate was slashed to an historic low of just 0.25 per cent. Irish PM Leo Varadkar has declared that schools, colleges and childcare facilities are to close for two weeks.He made a live statement to the nation from Washington DC, where he is due to meet Mr Trump later as part of the annual St Patrick's Day programme of events. 'Unfortunately we must face the tragic reality that some people will die,' he said.Mr Varadkar said he was acting on fresh advice from the country's National Public Health Emergency Team.'The virus is all over the world, it will continue to spread but it can be slowed,' he said. Dr David Halpern, head of the UK's Behavioural Insights Team dubbed Britain's 'Nudge Unit' who reports directly to Mr Johnson, has suggested the 500,000 people in UK care homes or with respiratory conditions could be the only people protected.He has suggested the virus can be beaten by letting it spread through healthy people to kill it off rather than a nationwide lockdown that could allow coronavirus to rise again later in the year.Dr Halpern has revealed ministers are considering a policy of keeping high-risk groups such as the elderly or those with underlying health conditions isolated in care homes or in their own homes over the coming months.He said: 'There's going to be a point, assuming the epidemic flows and grows as it will do, where you want to cocoon, to protect those at-risk groups so they don't catch the disease.'By the time they come out of their cocooning, herd immunity has been achieved in the rest of the population'. Deputy chief medical officer Jenny Harries was asked on the BBC if 'pretty much everyone will get it eventually'.'The thing about a new virus is, of course, nobody has antibodies ready-made to it. This virus is having a field day, the desire will be to infect as many people as it can,' she said.Dr Harries said it was possible that 'up to 80 per cent of the population' could contract the virus, but added that it was a 'very high estimate'.Scottish First minister Nicola Sturgeon said it was not possible to make the virus 'go away'.'This is a serious situation. We cannot make this virus go away. It is highly likely now that significant numbers of us are going to get this virus,' she said.'The vast majority will have very mild illness and the clear focus right now is on doing everything we can to protect those who are more susceptible to serious illness, but we cannot make this go away, we need to focus on how we manage this outbreak, delay the spread and reduce the numbers infected at any one time.'Scottish Secretary Alister Jack told BBC Radio Scotland's Good Morning Scotland programme there is 'no doubt we are not going to be able to contain it for very much longer' and that efforts will now focus on delaying the spread of the virus to 'put less pressure on the NHS'. Speaking hours after world health officials declared the coronavirus a pandemic, Trump repeatedly defended his own actions and vowed the nation would prevail in countering the virus and getting treatment on the market.'We will be suspending all travel from Europe to the United States for the next 30 days,' Trump announced, in a speech from the Oval Office to the nation. 'The new rules will go into effect Friday at midnight,' he said. The move was so sudden the acting Homeland Security secretary said he would issue full guidance on how to carry it out within 48 hours.The White House said the travel restrictions would apply to foreign nationals who have visited 26 European countries - but excluding the UK and Ireland - in the past 14 days. It will not apply to US citizens, their 'immediate' family members or legal permanent residents. But confusion remained over how exactly the rules would apply and in what time zone the deadline would be introduced.

Social media users reported quieter than usual trains travelling to cities including London, Glasgow, Edinburgh, Sheffield, Newcastle, Birmingham and Cambridge.One Twitter user said: 'It's so quiet for the rush hour train to Newcastle ... everyone in scarves or masks and you can tell the sheer fear has hit.' Another wrote: 'Eerily quiet on the trains this morning but business as usual on the ward. Has the feel of those weird days between Christmas and New Year.' The mass stayaway came after the Prime Minister said people with even mild symptoms, including a continuous cough or high temperature, must stay at home for at least seven days.Boris Johnson's guidance was issued yesterday with between 5,000 and 10,000 people in the UK already thought to be infected with coronavirus, when the official figures show 596 cases and ten deaths. The Government's softer approach to shutting down communities when compared to other countries has triggered a row as critics including former ministers Jeremy Hunt and Rory Stewart branding the decision to keep schools open and not to ban major gatherings 'concerning' and 'dangerous'.As the UK's coronavirus situation escalates, global developments include: •A Chinese spokesman accused the US military of bringing the coronavirus to Wuhan - the Chinese city where the COVID-19 outbreak began at the end of December;•A 37-year-old US woman who beat the infection claimed she didn't suffer the tell-tale symptom of a cough and instead only had a headache and tingling arms and legs;•French President Emmanuel Macron declared the pandemic as France's worst health crisis in a century and announced schools, universities and day-care centres would be shut from Monday;•Portuguese Prime Minister Antonio Costa ordered the shut-down of schools and universities and placed limits on the number of people in nightclubs, restaurants and shopping centres at any one time;•Belgium announced the closure of all schools, restaurants, cafes and nightclubs and also banned recreational and sporting events in its fight to contain the growing epidemic;•Danish authorities called on shoppers to avoid excessive stockpiling after it closed schools and universities and suspended indoor events with more than 100 participants;•Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon revealed gatherings of 500 people or more would be stopped from Monday and school trips would be cancelled;•Germany shut nightclubs and schools after Chancellor Angela Merkel warned that up to 70 per cent of the country's population - 58million people - could contract the coronavirus;•Spain locked down four towns in Catalonia, shut schools and universities and suspended Parliament after its deputy prime minister was in self-isolation after his wife tested positive for the virus;•An Italian medical chief died of the coronavirus at the age of 67, as the death toll in the country - the centre of Europe's escalating crisis - jumped to over 1,000;•Australia's Prime Minister Scott Morrison announced the government will effectively ban 'non essential' public gatherings of more than 500 people from Monday.[related]What to do if a worker has coronavirus  By MINI SETTY, a partner in employment law at Langleys SolicitorsIf an employee has coronavirus then the business' usual sickness absence policy will come into effect. All employers should have an effective sickness absence policy, which will help them manage workplace absences consistently and effectively.Ahead of any further spread of coronavirus, it is recommended that employers should remind their employees of the required standards of attendance and what is expected from them. This is also a good opportunity to remind workers of hygiene standards and other policies of the business.Businesses should also consider implementing an infectious diseases strategy which details the Company's response to the spread of infectious diseases. This will safeguard a business from any similar future outbreaks. Arriving at Manchester Piccadilly train station this morning was project manager Rizwan Atcha, 37, who told MailOnline: 'I've come from Bolton, the train was eerie.'Normally you can't get any space but today there was more than usual. I'm assuming that was because of the virus. 'I have driven to Manchester before but it takes twice as long. In terms of taking the risk I'm ready to meet my maker.' Nick Parker, 44, a mortgage lender from Buckingham, said: 'I come through from Milton Keynes once or twice a week.'It was quieter than normal and so was the station, no one was acting strangely but that's because there was only about four people in the carriage. You've just got to get on with things.'Leszek Monouszko, 34, a flight attendant from Dubai, added: 'I've come on the train from Manchester Airport, I came into Manchester yesterday as I work as a flight attendant.'I'm worried for my work but my health not so much. I think people our age should not be worried so much.'While exact passenger numbers were not available, the Rail Delivery Group confirmed they are lower than usual.A spokesman said: 'Our primary focus during the coronavirus outbreak is to keep our passengers and our people safe, and the country moving.'He added: 'While the Government is not advising people to avoid public transport, unless they are showing symptoms of coronavirus, and rail companies are enhancing their cleaning on trains and at stations, we are seeing fewer people choosing to travel.' The Government's decision not to announced stricter rules on travelling or gathering in crowds has prompted a political row, with Tory ex-ministers slamming Mr Johnson's course of action. Jeremy Hunt, former Health Secretary and now chair of the Commons health and social care select committee, believes the PM must do more to encourage social distancing - and was particularly concerned care homes are not being told to ban visitors. While Rory Stewart, London mayor candidate who led the UK's effort to fight Ebola in Africa in 2019, said: 'I think we can be very tough, and clear [with the British public]. This is the worst pandemic we have had for 100 years.'The Government's approach is essentially defeatist. They are saying we cannot suppress this. They say there is no point in spending a huge amount of money trying to suppress this, instead they are trying to manage the increase. We are taking far too much risk.'I think that is a dangerous thing to do. I don't think if we allow this to spread it can be managed in that way.'And when you start getting serious numbers of people dying and the terrible choices that have to be made in hospitals, people will think that paying the cost early, now, was the right thing to do.'Mr Stewart, who is now an independent politician after leaving the Conservative Party, added: 'I'm absolutely confident that acting early is the better option. I would be shutting all schools and banning all gatherings immediately.'I think it is too pessimistic and defeatist and we should be taking the approach seen in China and South Korea that have actually reduced the number of cases. It can be done. It requires very tough and extreme measures.'The Government questions whether the public is up for the kind of measures we have seen in other countries. I disagree, I believe the British public will do what others have done'.Debate is raging over whether the Prime Minister has gone far enough to protect the UK's 66million people from the pandemic.The official number of coronavirus cases in the UK yesterday jumped by 134 to 596 with 10 deaths - but the Government's chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance said the true number was probably up to 10,000 cases and growing rapidly. But Mr Johnson has still held off drastic measures enforced across Europe such as banning mass gatherings and closing schools, telling Britons that the most important measure remains to wash hands for 20 seconds - and told people to stay at home for seven days if they have a new persistent cough or a high temperature. A ban on flights to and from Europe - like the one announced by US President Donald Trump - was also dismissed by the Government yesterday. Asked about the decision not to cancel large gatherings yet, with 70,000 at Cheltenham for the Gold Cup today, Jeremy Hunt told the BBC's Newsnight: 'I think it is surprising and concerning that we're not doing any of it at all when we have just four weeks before we get to the stage that Italy is at.' What is the government guidance on the virus?  SymptomsThe most common symptoms of coronavirus (COVID-19) are recent onset of:•new continuous cough and/or•high temperatureFor most people, coronavirus (COVID-19) will be a mild infectionKey messagesif you have symptoms of coronavirus infection (COVID-19), however mild, stay at home and do not leave your house for 7 days from when your symptoms started.

If your symptoms worsen during home isolation or are no better after 7 days contact NHS 111 online. If you have no internet access, you should call NHS 111. For a medical emergency dial 999.Mini Setty, a partner in employment law at Langleys Solicitors said: 'As the UK attempts to delay the peak of the virus, millions of Britons are getting ready to work from home and considering ways to 'socially distance' themselves from others.'Thousands of businesses, are frantically making plans to better enable remote working during this time, setting up conference facilities to connect businesses with their clients and putting in place operational strategies in the event a member of their workforce tests positive for COVID-19 or their offices have to shut'.Adam Pennington, employment law solicitor at Stephensons, told MailOnline: 'As the coronavirus pandemic takes a firm grip in the UK, it's clear that many businesses are now exploring options for staff to work from home wherever possible. It's expected that thousands of workers will take up home working opportunities over the next few weeks and from what we have seen many have already begun to do so. 'An IWG Global Workplace survey found 61 per cent of companies currently allow their staff to work remotely, meaning as many as 20 million UK workers already can work from home as pandemic worsens and the safeguarding measures continue.'If schools and universities are asked to close by the Government, the number of people working from home will surge in the coming days.'Meanwhile in the West Midlands, Birmingham New Street train station was busy as usual but passengers spoke of 'emptier trains' and lots of 'hand sanitizer'. Paul Burne, 35, a father of two who works as a sales manager, said he had to reduce his travelling due to coronavirus.He said: 'I travel almost every day because of my work and I think trains are as busy as always, I can't see a massive amount of change.'I haven't seen many people taking any precautions apart from hand sanitizer. I try to be as hygienic as possible. I'm more careful of what I eat and try to keep fit and healthy.'I have already reduced my trips as much as I could, but am a bit more reluctant to travel to London due to the congestion so overall I've made some slight changes.' Sophie Pearce, 18, a student, said: 'I travel every day to go to college so I think I am more at risk. There are so many people on the train and you don't know who's washed their hands or not, who's got it or not.'I would certainly not take the train at all and stay home if I could. Trains are busy as always I don't think people have stopped travelling because of coronavirus'.Another student, Jasmine Gardener, 18, said: 'There aren't many people taking precautions. I've only seen a few using hand sanitizer- as soon as someone coughs though, you notice everyone turning around.'I use hand sanitizer and wash my hands but I'm not that worried yet. If I could stay at home I would though, just because I get the train every day.'The Government has now ordered school trips to be stopped and people over 70 with serious medical conditions not to go on cruises. Officials have also warned the advice is likely to develop so that entire households could be told to self-isolate.The Government said it would not move to close schools yet as the evidence for its effectiveness is lacking, though this will be kept under review.It is also considering banning large events, mostly due to the burden such events place on public services.[item name=video id=4183972 style=2 /]High-profile people to be diagnosed with Covid-19 include Arsenal head coach Mikel Arteta and BT boss Philip Jansen.Chelsea's full squad has also gone into self-isolation after winger Callum Hudson-Odoi tested positive for coronavirus.England's Chief Medical Officer, Professor Chris Whitty, said the peak of the outbreak is most likely still 10 to 14 weeks away.He said it is feared people will become 'fatigued' by more stringent measures if they are brought in too soon and therefore they would lose their maximum effect.The number of people who have tested positive for the virus in the UK rose to 596 while the death toll in British hospitals is ten.A Rail Delivery Group spokesman said: 'Our primary focus during the coronavirus outbreak is to keep our passengers and our people safe, and the country moving. 'While the government is not advising people to avoid public transport, unless they are showing symptoms of coronavirus, and rail companies are enhancing their cleaning on trains and at stations, we are seeing fewer people choosing to travel.'Popular sites in London such as the Tate Modern and Tower of London have also been left deserted, along with shopping areas of Piccadilly Circus and Regent Street.The Tate Modern's iconic Turbine Hall was almost empty. The art gallery usually gets more than 15,000 visitors each day, according to the latest figures.The National Theatre appeared deserted, despite several matinee showings. Staff members running a carousel by the London Eye said they feared they could go bust.At the Shard - a chance to see a view of London from the UK's highest building - only a couple of people waited in line, and staff members tried to hawk people from the street.The Tower of London, where visitors wait to see the Crown Jewels, was also deserted. A tour guide said: 'For the last two days it has been really quiet.'She added that the tourist attraction had 'contingency plans' in place as more stringent measures in place. Meanwhile there was no queue at St Paul's Cathedral.Many venues have slapped up signs warning people to wash their hands more frequently, and be wary of the Coronavirus.Meanwhile it emerged that a London Underground driver has tested positive for coronavirus. The man, who works on the Tube's Jubilee Line, had been off work this week after returning from holiday in Vietnam.An internal message to staff said the driver, based at the North Greenwich depot, had been self-isolating but had tested positive for Covid-19.'The operator is receiving support from health services and is continuing to follow Public Health England (PHE) advice to self-isolate.[item name=video id=4183318 style=2 /]'The train operator has recently returned from a trip abroad, where it is thought the illness may have been contracted,' said the memo.A Transport for London spokesman said the driver was receiving support from health services, adding that he was not working in a customer-facing area.'The safety of our staff and customers is our top priority and we are taking all necessary precautions.'The areas where the driver worked are being cleaned, including the depot and the trains, in line with guidance from Public Health England with whom we are working closely.'TfL has introduced an enhanced cleaning regime using additional substances to prevent the spread of the deadly virus on the city's public transport.The busiest stations and key interchanges are to being cleaned more regularly - even during the day.And TfL is at the final stages of testing a new, long-lasting cleaning agent that would provide anti-viral protection for up to 30 days.It hopes to begin using the new cleaner in the next couple of weeks, alongside specialist hygiene back-pack equipment to spray disinfectant across the network.Two ex-Tory ministers today tore apart Boris Johnson's 'risky' decision not to lockdown Britain to tackle the coronavirus 'national emergency' with Jeremy Hunt revealing he is 'surprised and concerned' and Rory Stewart calling the PM's plans to allow millions to be infected 'pessimistic' and 'defeatist'.Mr Hunt, who is now chair of the Commons health and social care select committee, believes the PM must do more to encourage social distancing - and was particularly concerned care homes are not being told to ban visitors.

[item name=video id=4183476 style=2 /][item name=video id=4183478 style=2 /]Italy - the world's worst-hit country after China - is in complete lockdown as the country's tally of deaths has topped 1,000 with more than 15,000 patients infected by the virus. In response to the growing threat across Europe, Ireland yesterday closed all schools, colleges and nurseries and banned gatherings of more than 500 people. Norway's Prime Minister Erna Solberg last night put the country on a footing never seen in peacetime, despite having recorded no coronavirus deaths yet. Ms Solberg took all the Irish steps as well as banning all health workers from leaving the country, and forcing anyone returning from abroad into quarantine, including the king and queen who have been on a state visit to Jordan. But controversially the British Government appears to be pursuing a policy of 'herd immunity' - where the majority of the healthy population will get and fight off the virus so that the disease cannot be spread easily any more. The elderly and ill will be 'cocooned' from the outside world to protect them for weeks or even months. Critics have warned the policy is high risk because there have been multiple reports in China of people getting it twice - and concerns from experts that coronavirus could mutate and infect hundreds of thousands again in the coming years unless there is a vaccine.In other developments today to the escalating global crisis, which has seen more than 131,000 patients across the world get infected: •A Chinese spokesman accused the US military of bringing the coronavirus to Wuhan - the Chinese city where the COVID-19 outbreak began at the end of December;•A 37-year-old US woman who beat the infection claimed she didn't suffer the tell-tale symptom of a cough and instead only had a headache and tingling arms and legs;•French President Emmanuel Macron declared the pandemic as France's worst health crisis in a century and announced schools, universities and day-care centres would be shut from Monday;•Portuguese Prime Minister Antonio Costa ordered the shut-down of schools and universities and placed limits on the number of people in nightclubs, restaurants and shopping centres at any one time;•Belgium announced the closure of all schools, restaurants, cafes and nightclubs and also banned recreational and sporting events in its fight to contain the growing epidemic;•Danish authorities called on shoppers to avoid excessive stockpiling after it closed schools and universities and suspended indoor events with more than 100 participants;•Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon revealed gatherings of 500 people or more would be stopped from Monday and school trips would be cancelled;•Germany shut nightclubs and schools after Chancellor Angela Merkel warned that up to 70 per cent of the country's population - 58million people - could contract the coronavirus;•Spain locked down four towns in Catalonia, shut schools and universities and suspended Parliament after its deputy prime minister was in self-isolation after his wife tested positive for the virus;•An Italian medical chief died of the coronavirus at the age of 67, as the death toll in the country - the centre of Europe's escalating crisis - jumped to over 1,000;•Australia's Prime Minister Scott Morrison announced the government will effectively ban 'non essential' public gatherings of more than 500 people from Monday.Sir Patrick Vallance, the UK's chief scientific adviser, has today defended the Government's approach and its lack of hardline response along the lines seen across Europe.He told Sky News: 'We've got a panel of very world leading scientists across epidemiology, mathematical modelling, virology, clinicians, and we're taking input from leading academics to try and come up with a plan that actually does what we want to do.'It doesn't mean that the others are doing something wrong, and in fact much of the advice and much of the actions, if you look at them, they are trying to achieve the same thing.'And that is to try to reduce the peak of the epidemic, flatten it and broaden it so that you don't end up with so much intense pressure on healthcare systems at one time'.He added: 'And mass gatherings of course are a place where you can potentially get infection from somebody, but the alternative is also important that if you're not at a mass gathering, you're at a small gathering, and most of the transmission of these types of viruses occur in small gatherings, not in big gatherings'. Sir Patrick insists that telling people with cold and flu-like symptoms to stay at home for a week will have an impact.He said: 'The measures that were announced, which is about self-isolation, even if you've got very mild symptoms, will mean a large number of people actually at home, being isolated because of this infection.'That's a very big measure actually, it's going to have quite a big impact across a number of households and a number of people, so I don't think that's a trivial measure at all.'And all the modelling suggests that these sorts of measures, and the other two that we discussed yesterday, the ones that have the biggest impact'.Boris Johnson yesterday branded coronavirus the 'worst public health crisis in a generation' and warned that 'many more' people are going to die - but still held off drastic measures. Mr Hunt, chair of the Commons health and social care committee, said he was also 'personally surprised that we're still allowing external visits to care homes'. The Prime Minister said it was clear the disease will continue to spread around the world and people should brace for the 'reality' of 'severe disruption' for many months.At a press conference in Westminster, Mr Johnson formally declared that the UK's tactics have shifted from 'containing' the killer disease to merely 'delaying' its inevitable spread, after he chaired a meeting of the Cobra emergency committee. The Government's new plan urges anyone with even mild coronavirus-like symptoms - a persistent cough or a fever - to quarantine themselves at home and to sleep alone if possible and stay at least two metres from relatives.The PM has also recommended all overseas school trips be cancelled while people over the age of 70 or those with pre-existing serious medical conditions have been told not to go on cruises.But he stopped short of more extreme measures such as closing schools and banning mass gatherings which have been adopted in Ireland, Norway, France and Italy in an effort to stem the spread of the virus. 'At all stages we have been guided by the science. We will do the right thing at the right time,' Mr Johnson said. The number of UK cases has risen by 130 and the death toll hit 10 in the last 24 hours, with experts increasingly bracing for turmoil as the overwhelming majority of the population becomes infected and the country develops 'herd immunity'. But chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance said he believed the true number of infections was likely to be 5,000-10,000 already. He estimated that the UK was four weeks behind the trajectory of the crisis in Italy - which has brought the country to its knees.The peak of the outbreak in the UK might not come for 10-14 weeks, the experts said - suggesting it will run into June. [item name=video id=4183462 style=2 /][item name=module id=1163133 style=153 /]Mr Johnson insisted comparisons to seasonal flu were wrong. WHAT IS HERD IMMUNITY AND WILL IT EVEN WORK?  Herd immunity is a situation in which a population of people is protected from a disease because so many of them are unaffected by it that it cannot spread. To cause an outbreak a disease-causing bacteria or virus must have a continuous supply of potential victims who are not immune to it.Immunity is when your body knows exactly how to fight off a certain type of infection because it has encountered it before, either by having the illness in the past or through a vaccine.When a virus or bacteria enters the body the immune system creates substances called antibodies, which are designed to destroy one specific type of bug.When these have been created once, some of them remain in the body and the body also remembers how to make them again. This provides long-term protection, or immunity, against an illness.If nobody is immune to an illness - as was the case at the beginning of the coronavirus outbreak - it can spread like wildfire.However, if, for example, half of people have developed immunity - from a past infection or a vaccine - there are only half as many people the illness can spread to.As more and more people become immune the bug finds it harder and harder to spread until its pool of victims becomes so small it can no longer spread at all.The threshold for herd immunity is different for various illnesses, depending on how contagious they are - for measles, around 95 per cent of people must be vaccinated to it spreading.For polio, which is less contagious, the threshold is about 80-85 per cent, according to the Oxford Vaccine Group.'This is more dangerous and it's going to spread further. And I must level with you and the British public: more families, many more families, are going to lose loved ones before their time,' he said. Despite the bloodcurdling warnings, Mr Johnson said the UK would not close schools yet even though government advisers admitted the move would help stem the outbreak. Advisers said the length of closure necessary to make the measure work could be more than 16 weeks and would at this stage therefore not be feasible. Chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance said it was not realistic to expect children to be cooped up that long. He said: 'It is true that there is some effect in closing schools but that effect is minimal and actually you would have to do it for 13 to 16 weeks or longer.'You do not have to be a very advanced mathematician to work out that the chances of keeping children not speaking to each other or playing with each other are zero.'Closing down schools could also put elderly grandparents at risk if they were asked to look after children, who are believed to be less susceptible to the most severe form of the disease but can still spread it.'The scientific advice is that this could do more harm than good,' Mr Johnson said. 'But we are keeping this under review and this could change as the disease spreads. Schools should only close if they are specifically advised to do so.'Mr Johnson conceded that Scotland was already banning mass gatherings, but suggested there was a 'particular issue with the resilience of their public services' north of the border, in a perceived swipe at Nicola Sturgeon after she undermined him by announcing her plans first.'We are not saying no to that sort of measures, of course not,' Mr Johnson said. 'We are keeping it up our sleeves. But it is very important... that we get the timing right.'

Social media users reported quieter than usual trains travelling to cities including London, Glasgow, Edinburgh, Sheffield, Newcastle, Birmingham and Cambridge.One Twitter user said: 'It's so quiet for the rush hour train to Newcastle ... everyone in scarves or masks and you can tell the sheer fear has hit.' Another wrote: 'Eerily quiet on the trains this morning but business as usual on the ward. Has the feel of those weird days between Christmas and New Year.' The mass stayaway came after the Prime Minister said people with even mild symptoms, including a continuous cough or high temperature, must stay at home for at least seven days.Boris Johnson's guidance was issued yesterday with between 5,000 and 10,000 people in the UK already thought to be infected with coronavirus, when the official figures show 596 cases and ten deaths. The Government's softer approach to shutting down communities when compared to other countries has triggered a row as critics including former ministers Jeremy Hunt and Rory Stewart branding the decision to keep schools open and not to ban major gatherings 'concerning' and 'dangerous'.As the UK's coronavirus situation escalates, global developments include: •A Chinese spokesman accused the US military of bringing the coronavirus to Wuhan - the Chinese city where the COVID-19 outbreak began at the end of December;•A 37-year-old US woman who beat the infection claimed she didn't suffer the tell-tale symptom of a cough and instead only had a headache and tingling arms and legs;•French President Emmanuel Macron declared the pandemic as France's worst health crisis in a century and announced schools, universities and day-care centres would be shut from Monday;•Portuguese Prime Minister Antonio Costa ordered the shut-down of schools and universities and placed limits on the number of people in nightclubs, restaurants and shopping centres at any one time;•Belgium announced the closure of all schools, restaurants, cafes and nightclubs and also banned recreational and sporting events in its fight to contain the growing epidemic;•Danish authorities called on shoppers to avoid excessive stockpiling after it closed schools and universities and suspended indoor events with more than 100 participants;•Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon revealed gatherings of 500 people or more would be stopped from Monday and school trips would be cancelled;•Germany shut nightclubs and schools after Chancellor Angela Merkel warned that up to 70 per cent of the country's population - 58million people - could contract the coronavirus;•Spain locked down four towns in Catalonia, shut schools and universities and suspended Parliament after its deputy prime minister was in self-isolation after his wife tested positive for the virus;•An Italian medical chief died of the coronavirus at the age of 67, as the death toll in the country - the centre of Europe's escalating crisis - jumped to over 1,000;•Australia's Prime Minister Scott Morrison announced the government will effectively ban 'non essential' public gatherings of more than 500 people from Monday.[related]What to do if a worker has coronavirus  By MINI SETTY, a partner in employment law at Langleys SolicitorsIf an employee has coronavirus then the business' usual sickness absence policy will come into effect. All employers should have an effective sickness absence policy, which will help them manage workplace absences consistently and effectively.Ahead of any further spread of coronavirus, it is recommended that employers should remind their employees of the required standards of attendance and what is expected from them. This is also a good opportunity to remind workers of hygiene standards and other policies of the business.Businesses should also consider implementing an infectious diseases strategy which details the Company's response to the spread of infectious diseases. This will safeguard a business from any similar future outbreaks. Arriving at Manchester Piccadilly train station this morning was project manager Rizwan Atcha, 37, who told MailOnline: 'I've come from Bolton, the train was eerie.'Normally you can't get any space but today there was more than usual. I'm assuming that was because of the virus. 'I have driven to Manchester before but it takes twice as long. In terms of taking the risk I'm ready to meet my maker.' Nick Parker, 44, a mortgage lender from Buckingham, said: 'I come through from Milton Keynes once or twice a week.'It was quieter than normal and so was the station, no one was acting strangely but that's because there was only about four people in the carriage. You've just got to get on with things.'Leszek Monouszko, 34, a flight attendant from Dubai, added: 'I've come on the train from Manchester Airport, I came into Manchester yesterday as I work as a flight attendant.'I'm worried for my work but my health not so much. I think people our age should not be worried so much.'While exact passenger numbers were not available, the Rail Delivery Group confirmed they are lower than usual.A spokesman said: 'Our primary focus during the coronavirus outbreak is to keep our passengers and our people safe, and the country moving.'He added: 'While the Government is not advising people to avoid public transport, unless they are showing symptoms of coronavirus, and rail companies are enhancing their cleaning on trains and at stations, we are seeing fewer people choosing to travel.' The Government's decision not to announced stricter rules on travelling or gathering in crowds has prompted a political row, with Tory ex-ministers slamming Mr Johnson's course of action. Jeremy Hunt, former Health Secretary and now chair of the Commons health and social care select committee, believes the PM must do more to encourage social distancing - and was particularly concerned care homes are not being told to ban visitors. While Rory Stewart, London mayor candidate who led the UK's effort to fight Ebola in Africa in 2019, said: 'I think we can be very tough, and clear [with the British public]. This is the worst pandemic we have had for 100 years.'The Government's approach is essentially defeatist. They are saying we cannot suppress this. They say there is no point in spending a huge amount of money trying to suppress this, instead they are trying to manage the increase. We are taking far too much risk.'I think that is a dangerous thing to do. I don't think if we allow this to spread it can be managed in that way.'And when you start getting serious numbers of people dying and the terrible choices that have to be made in hospitals, people will think that paying the cost early, now, was the right thing to do.'Mr Stewart, who is now an independent politician after leaving the Conservative Party, added: 'I'm absolutely confident that acting early is the better option. I would be shutting all schools and banning all gatherings immediately.'I think it is too pessimistic and defeatist and we should be taking the approach seen in China and South Korea that have actually reduced the number of cases. It can be done. It requires very tough and extreme measures.'The Government questions whether the public is up for the kind of measures we have seen in other countries. I disagree, I believe the British public will do what others have done'.Debate is raging over whether the Prime Minister has gone far enough to protect the UK's 66million people from the pandemic.The official number of coronavirus cases in the UK yesterday jumped by 134 to 596 with 10 deaths - but the Government's chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance said the true number was probably up to 10,000 cases and growing rapidly. But Mr Johnson has still held off drastic measures enforced across Europe such as banning mass gatherings and closing schools, telling Britons that the most important measure remains to wash hands for 20 seconds - and told people to stay at home for seven days if they have a new persistent cough or a high temperature. A ban on flights to and from Europe - like the one announced by US President Donald Trump - was also dismissed by the Government yesterday. Asked about the decision not to cancel large gatherings yet, with 70,000 at Cheltenham for the Gold Cup today, Jeremy Hunt told the BBC's Newsnight: 'I think it is surprising and concerning that we're not doing any of it at all when we have just four weeks before we get to the stage that Italy is at.' What is the government guidance on the virus?  SymptomsThe most common symptoms of coronavirus (COVID-19) are recent onset of:•new continuous cough and/or•high temperatureFor most people, coronavirus (COVID-19) will be a mild infectionKey messagesif you have symptoms of coronavirus infection (COVID-19), however mild, stay at home and do not leave your house for 7 days from when your symptoms started. (See Ending Isolation section below for more information)this action will help protect others in your community whilst you are infectious.plan ahead and ask others for help to ensure that you can successfully stay at home.ask your employer, friends and family to help you to get the things you need to stay at home.stay at least 2 metres (about 3 steps) away from other people in your home whenever possible.sleep alone, if that is possible.wash your hands regularly for 20 seconds, each time using soap and water.stay away from vulnerable individuals such as the elderly and those with underlying health conditions as much as possible.you do not need to call NHS111 to go into self-isolation. If your symptoms worsen during home isolation or are no better after 7 days contact NHS 111 online. If you have no internet access, you should call NHS 111. For a medical emergency dial 999.Mini Setty, a partner in employment law at Langleys Solicitors said: 'As the UK attempts to delay the peak of the virus, millions of Britons are getting ready to work from home and considering ways to 'socially distance' themselves from others.'Thousands of businesses, are frantically making plans to better enable remote working during this time, setting up conference facilities to connect businesses with their clients and putting in place operational strategies in the event a member of their workforce tests positive for COVID-19 or their offices have to shut'.Adam Pennington, employment law solicitor at Stephensons, told MailOnline: 'As the coronavirus pandemic takes a firm grip in the UK, it's clear that many businesses are now exploring options for staff to work from home wherever possible. It's expected that thousands of workers will take up home working opportunities over the next few weeks and from what we have seen many have already begun to do so. 'An IWG Global Workplace survey found 61 per cent of companies currently allow their staff to work remotely, meaning as many as 20 million UK workers already can work from home as pandemic worsens and the safeguarding measures continue.'If schools and universities are asked to close by the Government, the number of people working from home will surge in the coming days.'Meanwhile in the West Midlands, Birmingham New Street train station was busy as usual but passengers spoke of 'emptier trains' and lots of 'hand sanitizer'. Paul Burne, 35, a father of two who works as a sales manager, said he had to reduce his travelling due to coronavirus.He said: 'I travel almost every day because of my work and I think trains are as busy as always, I can't see a massive amount of change.'I haven't seen many people taking any precautions apart from hand sanitizer. I try to be as hygienic as possible. I'm more careful of what I eat and try to keep fit and healthy.'I have already reduced my trips as much as I could, but am a bit more reluctant to travel to London due to the congestion so overall I've made some slight changes.' Sophie Pearce, 18, a student, said: 'I travel every day to go to college so I think I am more at risk. There are so many people on the train and you don't know who's washed their hands or not, who's got it or not.'I would certainly not take the train at all and stay home if I could. Trains are busy as always I don't think people have stopped travelling because of coronavirus'.Another student, Jasmine Gardener, 18, said: 'There aren't many people taking precautions. I've only seen a few using hand sanitizer- as soon as someone coughs though, you notice everyone turning around.'I use hand sanitizer and wash my hands but I'm not that worried yet. If I could stay at home I would though, just because I get the train every day.'The Government has now ordered school trips to be stopped and people over 70 with serious medical conditions not to go on cruises. Officials have also warned the advice is likely to develop so that entire households could be told to self-isolate.The Government said it would not move to close schools yet as the evidence for its effectiveness is lacking, though this will be kept under review.It is also considering banning large events, mostly due to the burden such events place on public services.[item name=video id=4183972 style=2 /]High-profile people to be diagnosed with Covid-19 include Arsenal head coach Mikel Arteta and BT boss Philip Jansen.Chelsea's full squad has also gone into self-isolation after winger Callum Hudson-Odoi tested positive for coronavirus.England's Chief Medical Officer, Professor Chris Whitty, said the peak of the outbreak is most likely still 10 to 14 weeks away.He said it is feared people will become 'fatigued' by more stringent measures if they are brought in too soon and therefore they would lose their maximum effect.The number of people who have tested positive for the virus in the UK rose to 596 while the death toll in British hospitals is ten.A Rail Delivery Group spokesman said: 'Our primary focus during the coronavirus outbreak is to keep our passengers and our people safe, and the country moving. 'While the government is not advising people to avoid public transport, unless they are showing symptoms of coronavirus, and rail companies are enhancing their cleaning on trains and at stations, we are seeing fewer people choosing to travel.'Popular sites in London such as the Tate Modern and Tower of London have also been left deserted, along with shopping areas of Piccadilly Circus and Regent Street.The Tate Modern's iconic Turbine Hall was almost empty. The art gallery usually gets more than 15,000 visitors each day, according to the latest figures.The National Theatre appeared deserted, despite several matinee showings. Staff members running a carousel by the London Eye said they feared they could go bust.At the Shard - a chance to see a view of London from the UK's highest building - only a couple of people waited in line, and staff members tried to hawk people from the street.The Tower of London, where visitors wait to see the Crown Jewels, was also deserted. A tour guide said: 'For the last two days it has been really quiet.'She added that the tourist attraction had 'contingency plans' in place as more stringent measures in place. Meanwhile there was no queue at St Paul's Cathedral.Many venues have slapped up signs warning people to wash their hands more frequently, and be wary of the Coronavirus.Meanwhile it emerged that a London Underground driver has tested positive for coronavirus. The man, who works on the Tube's Jubilee Line, had been off work this week after returning from holiday in Vietnam.An internal message to staff said the driver, based at the North Greenwich depot, had been self-isolating but had tested positive for Covid-19.'The operator is receiving support from health services and is continuing to follow Public Health England (PHE) advice to self-isolate.[item name=video id=4183318 style=2 /]'The train operator has recently returned from a trip abroad, where it is thought the illness may have been contracted,' said the memo.A Transport for London spokesman said the driver was receiving support from health services, adding that he was not working in a customer-facing area.'The safety of our staff and customers is our top priority and we are taking all necessary precautions.'The areas where the driver worked are being cleaned, including the depot and the trains, in line with guidance from Public Health England with whom we are working closely.'TfL has introduced an enhanced cleaning regime using additional substances to prevent the spread of the deadly virus on the city's public transport.The busiest stations and key interchanges are to being cleaned more regularly - even during the day.And TfL is at the final stages of testing a new, long-lasting cleaning agent that would provide anti-viral protection for up to 30 days.It hopes to begin using the new cleaner in the next couple of weeks, alongside specialist hygiene back-pack equipment to spray disinfectant across the network.Two ex-Tory ministers today tore apart Boris Johnson's 'risky' decision not to lockdown Britain to tackle the coronavirus 'national emergency' with Jeremy Hunt revealing he is 'surprised and concerned' and Rory Stewart calling the PM's plans to allow millions to be infected 'pessimistic' and 'defeatist'.Mr Hunt, who is now chair of the Commons health and social care select committee, believes the PM must do more to encourage social distancing - and was particularly concerned care homes are not being told to ban visitors.

[item name=video id=4183476 style=2 /][item name=video id=4183478 style=2 /]Italy - the world's worst-hit country after China - is in complete lockdown as the country's tally of deaths has topped 1,000 with more than 15,000 patients infected by the virus. In response to the growing threat across Europe, Ireland yesterday closed all schools, colleges and nurseries and banned gatherings of more than 500 people. Norway's Prime Minister Erna Solberg last night put the country on a footing never seen in peacetime, despite having recorded no coronavirus deaths yet. Ms Solberg took all the Irish steps as well as banning all health workers from leaving the country, and forcing anyone returning from abroad into quarantine, including the king and queen who have been on a state visit to Jordan. But controversially the British Government appears to be pursuing a policy of 'herd immunity' - where the majority of the healthy population will get and fight off the virus so that the disease cannot be spread easily any more. The elderly and ill will be 'cocooned' from the outside world to protect them for weeks or even months. Critics have warned the policy is high risk because there have been multiple reports in China of people getting it twice - and concerns from experts that coronavirus could mutate and infect hundreds of thousands again in the coming years unless there is a vaccine.In other developments today to the escalating global crisis, which has seen more than 131,000 patients across the world get infected: •A Chinese spokesman accused the US military of bringing the coronavirus to Wuhan - the Chinese city where the COVID-19 outbreak began at the end of December;•A 37-year-old US woman who beat the infection claimed she didn't suffer the tell-tale symptom of a cough and instead only had a headache and tingling arms and legs;•French President Emmanuel Macron declared the pandemic as France's worst health crisis in a century and announced schools, universities and day-care centres would be shut from Monday;•Portuguese Prime Minister Antonio Costa ordered the shut-down of schools and universities and placed limits on the number of people in nightclubs, restaurants and shopping centres at any one time;•Belgium announced the closure of all schools, restaurants, cafes and nightclubs and also banned recreational and sporting events in its fight to contain the growing epidemic;•Danish authorities called on shoppers to avoid excessive stockpiling after it closed schools and universities and suspended indoor events with more than 100 participants;•Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon revealed gatherings of 500 people or more would be stopped from Monday and school trips would be cancelled;•Germany shut nightclubs and schools after Chancellor Angela Merkel warned that up to 70 per cent of the country's population - 58million people - could contract the coronavirus;•Spain locked down four towns in Catalonia, shut schools and universities and suspended Parliament after its deputy prime minister was in self-isolation after his wife tested positive for the virus;•An Italian medical chief died of the coronavirus at the age of 67, as the death toll in the country - the centre of Europe's escalating crisis - jumped to over 1,000;•Australia's Prime Minister Scott Morrison announced the government will effectively ban 'non essential' public gatherings of more than 500 people from Monday.Sir Patrick Vallance, the UK's chief scientific adviser, has today defended the Government's approach and its lack of hardline response along the lines seen across Europe.He told Sky News: 'We've got a panel of very world leading scientists across epidemiology, mathematical modelling, virology, clinicians, and we're taking input from leading academics to try and come up with a plan that actually does what we want to do.'It doesn't mean that the others are doing something wrong, and in fact much of the advice and much of the actions, if you look at them, they are trying to achieve the same thing.'And that is to try to reduce the peak of the epidemic, flatten it and broaden it so that you don't end up with so much intense pressure on healthcare systems at one time'.He added: 'And mass gatherings of course are a place where you can potentially get infection from somebody, but the alternative is also important that if you're not at a mass gathering, you're at a small gathering, and most of the transmission of these types of viruses occur in small gatherings, not in big gatherings'. Sir Patrick insists that telling people with cold and flu-like symptoms to stay at home for a week will have an impact.He said: 'The measures that were announced, which is about self-isolation, even if you've got very mild symptoms, will mean a large number of people actually at home, being isolated because of this infection.'That's a very big measure actually, it's going to have quite a big impact across a number of households and a number of people, so I don't think that's a trivial measure at all.'And all the modelling suggests that these sorts of measures, and the other two that we discussed yesterday, the ones that have the biggest impact'.Boris Johnson yesterday branded coronavirus the 'worst public health crisis in a generation' and warned that 'many more' people are going to die - but still held off drastic measures. Mr Hunt, chair of the Commons health and social care committee, said he was also 'personally surprised that we're still allowing external visits to care homes'. The Prime Minister said it was clear the disease will continue to spread around the world and people should brace for the 'reality' of 'severe disruption' for many months.At a press conference in Westminster, Mr Johnson formally declared that the UK's tactics have shifted from 'containing' the killer disease to merely 'delaying' its inevitable spread, after he chaired a meeting of the Cobra emergency committee. The Government's new plan urges anyone with even mild coronavirus-like symptoms - a persistent cough or a fever - to quarantine themselves at home and to sleep alone if possible and stay at least two metres from relatives.The PM has also recommended all overseas school trips be cancelled while people over the age of 70 or those with pre-existing serious medical conditions have been told not to go on cruises.But he stopped short of more extreme measures such as closing schools and banning mass gatherings which have been adopted in Ireland, Norway, France and Italy in an effort to stem the spread of the virus. 'At all stages we have been guided by the science. We will do the right thing at the right time,' Mr Johnson said. The number of UK cases has risen by 130 and the death toll hit 10 in the last 24 hours, with experts increasingly bracing for turmoil as the overwhelming majority of the population becomes infected and the country develops 'herd immunity'. But chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance said he believed the true number of infections was likely to be 5,000-10,000 already. He estimated that the UK was four weeks behind the trajectory of the crisis in Italy - which has brought the country to its knees.The peak of the outbreak in the UK might not come for 10-14 weeks, the experts said - suggesting it will run into June. [item name=video id=4183462 style=2 /][item name=module id=1163133 style=153 /]Mr Johnson insisted comparisons to seasonal flu were wrong. WHAT IS HERD IMMUNITY AND WILL IT EVEN WORK?  Herd immunity is a situation in which a population of people is protected from a disease because so many of them are unaffected by it that it cannot spread. To cause an outbreak a disease-causing bacteria or virus must have a continuous supply of potential victims who are not immune to it.Immunity is when your body knows exactly how to fight off a certain type of infection because it has encountered it before, either by having the illness in the past or through a vaccine.When a virus or bacteria enters the body the immune system creates substances called antibodies, which are designed to destroy one specific type of bug.When these have been created once, some of them remain in the body and the body also remembers how to make them again. This provides long-term protection, or immunity, against an illness.If nobody is immune to an illness - as was the case at the beginning of the coronavirus outbreak - it can spread like wildfire.However, if, for example, half of people have developed immunity - from a past infection or a vaccine - there are only half as many people the illness can spread to.As more and more people become immune the bug finds it harder and harder to spread until its pool of victims becomes so small it can no longer spread at all.The threshold for herd immunity is different for various illnesses, depending on how contagious they are - for measles, around 95 per cent of people must be vaccinated to it spreading.For polio, which is less contagious, the threshold is about 80-85 per cent, according to the Oxford Vaccine Group.'This is more dangerous and it's going to spread further. And I must level with you and the British public: more families, many more families, are going to lose loved ones before their time,' he said. Despite the bloodcurdling warnings, Mr Johnson said the UK would not close schools yet even though government advisers admitted the move would help stem the outbreak. Advisers said the length of closure necessary to make the measure work could be more than 16 weeks and would at this stage therefore not be feasible. Chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance said it was not realistic to expect children to be cooped up that long. He said: 'It is true that there is some effect in closing schools but that effect is minimal and actually you would have to do it for 13 to 16 weeks or longer.'You do not have to be a very advanced mathematician to work out that the chances of keeping children not speaking to each other or playing with each other are zero.'Closing down schools could also put elderly grandparents at risk if they were asked to look after children, who are believed to be less susceptible to the most severe form of the disease but can still spread it.'The scientific advice is that this could do more harm than good,' Mr Johnson said. 'But we are keeping this under review and this could change as the disease spreads. Schools should only close if they are specifically advised to do so.'Mr Johnson conceded that Scotland was already banning mass gatherings, but suggested there was a 'particular issue with the resilience of their public services' north of the border, in a perceived swipe at Nicola Sturgeon after she undermined him by announcing her plans first.'We are not saying no to that sort of measures, of course not,' Mr Johnson said. 'We are keeping it up our sleeves. But it is very important... that we get the timing right.'

The NHS is to form an unprecedented partnership with the private health sector this week in an emergency plan to combat the Covid-19 crisis, amid fears the UK's publicly-funded hospitals will be unable to cope with the number of coronavirus patients.•A group of more than 240 UK scientists have denounced the government's plan to achieve ""herd immunity"" by delaying measures to prevent the virus spreading. The group said that enforcing social distancing now could save ""thousands of lives"".•The Spanish government has formally declared a state of emergency over the coronavirus, placing the country in lockdown and ordering people to stay at home for the next two weeks unless they have to buy food or medicine or go to work or hospital. The measures are set to come into effect on Monday morning and follows in the example set by France hours earlier, which announced the closure all public places ""non-essential"" from midnight on Saturday.•Spanish PM's wife tests positive for coronavirus. The Spanish government announced that the prime minister's wife, Begoña Gómez, has tested positive for the coronavirus. Both Gomez and her husband, Pedro Sánchez, are doing well and remain at their official residence in Madrid, the Moncloa palace, the government said in a statement.•Israel proposes uses anti-terrorism tracking tech. Israel has - like France and Spain - announced a partial closure of the country, shutting down hotels, cafes, restaurants, cinemas, theatres and malls.

Colombia overnight closed its border with Venezuela in order to stem the spread of Covid-19 in the South American nation. The move to shut the border came overnight, after Venezuela confirmed its first two cases of Covid-19 on Friday morning. Colombia currently has 22 confirmed cases of Covid-19, but its government appears to view Venezuela - with fewer cases - as a possible centre of an outbreak in Latin America. Meanwhile, Ecuador announced it would ban foreigners from entering the country by land, sea or air. Citizens and residents will be able to enter until Monday, after which they will also face restrictions. Gatherings larger than 30 people have also been banned.•Libya's Tripoli-based Government of National Accord has declared a state of emergency over the coronavirus and will close all air and sea ports from Monday, prime minister Fayez al-Serraj said on Saturday. Libya, split for years between rival governments that have been fighting a war for nearly a year, lacks adequate isolation and other facilities to combat the virus, the head of its disease control centre told Reuters on Thursday.•Rwanda, Seychelles and Central African Republic confirmed their first coronavirus cases on Saturday - bringing the total number of African countries that have reported positive tests for the virus to 23. Sudan has ordered the closure of schools and universities for one month from Saturday to stop the spread of coronavirus, a statement from the prime minister's office said.

Hyperinflation is rampant, with shortages in basic foodstuffs and medical supplies already a daily reality. Around 1.4 million of those that have left have arrived to Colombia, which shares a 1,378-mile border with Venezuela.Authorities estimate as many as 40,000 people cross the border every day, the majority of which buy supplies - medicines and food staples - and return home.The move to shut the border came overnight, after Venezuela confirmed its first two cases of Covid-19 on Friday morning.The two countries broke diplomatic relations when Colombia ceased to recognise its embattled leader, Nicolás Maduro, as the country's legitimate president in early 2019, as part of an ongoing US-led coalition to oust him from office. Analysts say that will hamper coordination to contain a virus that does not respect borders.Others worry that the closure will force desperate Venezuelans to cross informally, putting them at risk of armed groups operating along the border. ""Colombia's overnight decision to 'close' its porous border with Venezuela won't stop the flow of people,"" tweeted Geoff Ramsey, a Venezuela expert at the Washington Office on Latin America. ""But it will force them to rely more on informal crossings where they'll be more vulnerable to exploitation and abuse.""Colombia currently has 22 confirmed cases of Covid-19, but its government appears to view Venezuela - with fewer cases - as a possible centre of an outbreak in Latin America. Iván Duque Márquez, Colombia's president, described the closure in a statement as ""a measure of protection ahead of the situation unfolding in [Venezuela].""Márquez also announced overnight a ban on travellers who have been in Europe or Asia in the last 14 days, with the exceptions of Colombian citizens and residents.All measures are expected to last until 30 May.Updated at 5.41pm GMT5.21pm GMTIn the UK, a newborn baby tested positive for coronavirus at a north London hospital earlier today. The child's mother, who was taken to a north London hospital days before the birth with suspected pneumonia, has also caught the virus.Richard Tedder, visiting professor in medical virology, Imperial College London, said this raises ""concerns about the potential ways in which this transmission may have occurred"".He told PA Media:It is important to say at this point in time that the detection of Covid-19 nucleic acid on the sample from the child does not necessarily mean that the child was infected. It could well have come from the mother at the time of delivery, further follow-up of the infant will clarify whether or not the infant is infected.Previous data from colleagues in China, published in the journal The Lancet, albeit on a small number of mother and infant pairs, did not show infection in any of the infants at the time of birth. Neither did sampling of breast milk immediately after birth contain detectable virus. Thus, the UK observation of a possible neonatal transmission is unexpected and needs further confirmation.The question of risk to a newly born child being nursed by a mother who is known to be infected is a matter that will need careful consideration. The absence of detectable virus in breast milk would appear to reduce the risk of breastfeeding however the close, intimate and entirely understandable contact between a mother and her baby will raise questions about how best to care for them. Compounding this too is the lack of knowledge of the clinical outcome of neonatal infection, should this actually occur.5.14pm GMTItaly's coronavirus death toll rose to 1,441 from 1,266 on Friday, according to official data. The number of confirmed cases has risen to 21,157 from 17,660 over the same period. 5.04pm GMTThe filming in Mexico of a big budget Steven Spielberg-produced Amazon mini-series, starring Spanish actor Javier Bardem, has been suspended due to concerns about the coronavirus, according to a letter sent to cast and crew on Friday and seen by Reuters.The production entitled Mexica, which centers on the Spanish conquest of the Aztecs, began filming two weeks ago on location in Mexico City. Mexico has so far confirmed 26 cases of coronavirus.Only a skeletal wrap crew will continue working through next week, and cast and crew were informed that production might resume in December depending on how the public health crisis develops.The project's budget is believed to be tens of millions of dollars, and dozens of local contractors will be affected by the suspension.

107,107,Johnson attempts to keep UK open for business;Politics. Medical advice ; PM believes other countries taking draconian action now will be vulnerable later,"March 14, 2020 Saturday","Boris Johnson remarked in 2007 that the true hero of the movie Jaws was the ""laudable"" mayor Larry Vaughn, who kept his seaside town open for business in spite of apparent hysteria around a series of shark attacks.""A gigantic fish is eating all your constituents and he decides to keep the beach open,"" the UK prime minister told a business audience. ""It turned out , while around the world the shutters are being put up.The prime minister, who said this week that Britain was facing ""the greatest public health crisis for a generation"", is facing criticism from some polihe was wrong. But it remains that he was heroically right in principle.""Mr Johnson, on the advice of his medical and scientific advisers, is trying to keep Britain open for business -- at least for now - - in the face of coronavirusticians and scientists for failing to act sufficiently swiftly or decisively.But Mr Johnson's stance has been based on an acceptance that the disease will spread widely in society: he wants to flatten its peak and delay the worst of the crisis until the summer.While some countries, such as Singapore or Hong Kong, have tried to stamp out the disease, Patrick Vallance, Mr Johnson's chief scientific adviser, says it is actually desirable to build up ""herd immunity"" to protect the country in the longer term.""About 60 per cent is the sort of figure you need to get herd immunity,"" Sir Patrick said. That suggests up to 40m people might contract the disease under the government's plan. As Mr Johnson concedes, many loved ones will die.Since mid-February, as the virus morphed from a health issue into a national crisis, the prime minister's chief adviser, Dominic Cummings, has helped to shape Mr Johnson's approach, relying on scientific experts and communicating through simple messaging. Mr Cummings has expressed interest in health and science. ""I am particularly interested in public health and the field of epidemiology,"" he wrote in 2016.Both of the government's three-word mantras came out of focus groups, a favoured tool of Mr Cummings. Following his success with ""take back control"" in the 2016 Brexit referendum and ""get Brexit done"" in the 2019 election, two slogans underpin its strategy: ""wash your hands"" and ""stay at home"".Mr Johnson and his scientific advisers hope to manage the epidemic by ""flattening the curve"" of infection and delaying the peak until the summer when the health service will face less seasonal pressure.Then - or so the theory goes - enough people will have acquired resistance to Covid-19 to avoid a second wave of disease next autumn or winter. Downing Street believes that other countries that have taken draconian action now will be vulnerable later.The strategy depends on building up ""herd immunity"" in the population. If a high enough proportion has become resistant through infection, then the virus will not have enough new people to infect and the epidemic will burn out.But the idea is not scientifically proven to work for this new virus, whose long-term effect on the immune system is unknown. As Rupert Beale, head of the Cell Biology of Infection Laboratory at London's Francis Crick Institute, put it: ""The problem is we don't know if 'herd immunity' can be achieved. Other coronaviruses can reinfect a few months down the line. We don't know yet for Covid-19.""Every medical expert says that no one will be able to assess the strength and duration of the human immune response to Covid-19 until people who have recovered from the disease have been studied for months. But Prof Hunter, a communicable diseases specialist, said: ""I will go out on a limb and suggest the immunity will not last for a lifetime but will last for more than a few months - possibly two or three years.""Illustrating the range of medical opinion, Martin Hibberd, professor of emerging infectious disease, London School of Hygiene &Tropical Medicine, is more optimistic. ""The evidence is increasingly convincing that infection with [Covid-19] leads to an antibody response that is protective,"" he said.""Most likely this protection is for life, although we need more evidence to be sure of this; people who have recovered are unlikely to be infected again.""Seasonal factors will also help the strategy of flattening and delaying the peak of the epidemic until the weather is warmer. Not only are flu and other respiratory viruses less prevalent in summer but many experts believe Covid-19 will behave in a similar way.The Institute of Human Virology at the University of Maryland has published research suggesting Covid-19 thrives best when average temperatures are between 5C and 11C, as in a mild European winter.The scientific advice governments consult to decide on policy includes not just public health but behavioural science. The UK and other governments have cited a concern that people may stop complying with a policy of isolation if it goes on for a long time.It is a well-founded concern, according to academics. ""My reading of the evidence is that adherence to the isolation policy dwindles over time,"" said Susan Michie, professor of health psychology at University College London. ""We know that psychological problems can arise in long-term isolation. People get bored and frustrated and feel lonely.""Mr Johnson and his pro-Brexit allies were notoriously prickly about the advice of ""experts"" at the time of the 2016 referendum; the prime minister is now taking a big political risk by backing them to the hilt on coronavirus.

118,118,Coronavirus: health experts fear epidemic will 'let rip' through UK;Doctors and scientists urge government to stop ignoring strategies from countries that have brought cases downCoronavirus - latest updatesSee all our coronavirus coverage,"March 15, 2020 Sunday","Public health experts and hundreds of doctors and scientists at home and abroad are urging the UK government to change its strategy against coronavirus, amid fears it will mean the epidemic ""lets rip"" through the population.They say the UK is turning its back on strategies that have successfully brought down the numbers of infections and deaths in other countries.On Thursday, Boris Johnson and his medical and scientific advisers announced that only those seriously ill in hospital would be tested. Anyone who had any symptoms should self-isolate at home for seven days, without notifying the NHS.Banning mass gatherings would not help reduce the spread of infections, the prime minister and his advisers said - although it now seems likely, largely in response to sporting and entertainment bodies cancelling events of their own accord.Anthony Costello, a UK paediatrician and former director of the World Health Organization (WHO), said he had personally written to the chief medical officer, Professor Chris Whitty, asking for testing to continue in the community.""The key principles from WHO are intensive surveillance,"" he told the Guardian. ""You test the population like crazy, find out where the cases are, immediately quarantine them and do contact tracing and get them out of the community. This deals with family clusters. That's the key bedrock of getting this under control.""This was how South Korea, China, Japan, Hong Kong and Taiwan had brought their case numbers down. ""You can really take people out of the population and make sure they are quarantined. That is vital - before you get to social distancing.""Yet the UK government was stopping tests outside of hospital. ""For me and the WHO people I have spoken to, this is absolutely the wrong policy. It would mean it just lets rip,"" he said.Costello thinks we will be in the same position as Italy within two weeks. ""The basic public health approach is playing second fiddle to mathematical modelling,"" he said.Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO's director general, expressed his deep concern on Friday at the end of testing and contact tracing in the UK and some other European countries.""You can't fight a virus if you don't know where it is,"" he said. ""Find, isolate, test and treat every case to break the chains of Covid transmission. Every case we find and treat limits the expansion of the disease.""Devi Sridhar, professor of global public health at The University of Edinburgh, listed on Twitter the reasons for continuing to test. ""1 People can alter behaviour based on whether they have Covid. 2 Break chains of transmission. 3 Local hospitals can plan for how many patients will need care. 4 To know where cases are emerging (hotspots). 5 How do we know how large problem is?""A government minister in Singapore has also expressed dismay. ""One concern we have with cases such as UK and Switzerland isn't just about the numbers. It is that these countries have abandoned any measure to contain or restrain the virus,"" minister for national development, Lawrence Wong, said at a press briefing on Sunday. ""If there's no attempt to contain, we estimate the number of cases in these countries to rise significantly in the coming days and weeks.""An open letter from a group including some of the UK's most senior doctors asked the government to publish the modelling and any other evidence for the policies it is pursuing. ""Our country's public health response to Covid-19 is demonstrably different to most other countries' responses globally and in Europe ... There is also no clear indication that the UK's response is being informed by experiences of other countries in containing the spread of Covid-19,"" it said, pointing out the risks to the NHS of a rapid and huge surge in cases of people needing hospital treatment. The UK has 2.5 beds per 1,000 people in the population, they said, which is fewer than France (6), Italy (3.2) and the United States (2.8).Immunologists, in a separate open letter, said they had ""significant questions"" about the government's apparent strategy to rely on building up ""herd immunity"" by exposure to the virus in the UK. Sir Patrick Vallance, the chief scientific adviser, has suggested this might be a good outcome from many people becoming infected.Herd immunity is usually brought about by vaccination - not exposing people to the risks of a disease. ""The ultimate aim of herd immunity is to stop disease spread and protect the most vulnerable in society. However, this strategy only works to reduce serious disease if, when building that immunity, vulnerable individuals are protected from becoming ill, for example through social distancing. If not, the consequences could be severe,"" says the letter from the British Society for Immunology.Behavioural scientists joined the concern, saying they believed the government should immediately bring in social distancing measures and not delay for fear of the public getting ""behavioural fatigue"".""If 'behavioural fatigue' truly represents a key factor in the government's decision to delay high-visibility interventions, we urge the government to share an adequate evidence base in support of that decision. If one is lacking, we urge the government to reconsider these decisions,"" wrote Prof Ulrike Hahn from Birkbeck, University of London, and others.",'behavioural_fatigue,,"(42, '""if \'behavioural_fatigue\' truly represents a key factor in the government\'s decision to delay high-visibility interventions, we urge the government to share an adequate evidence base in support of that decision.')",124

144,144,"Can Boris Johnson conjure up the spirit of the Blitz? As the coronavirus crisis worsens, the challenge and risks confronting the Prime Minister are Churchillian in magnitude, writes SIMON WALTERS","March 16, 2020 Monday","                     Boris Johnson did not draw a direct parallel with the threat posed to Britain by coronavirus and that of the Blitz in 1940. But at his Downing Street press conference yesterday he struck the dark, serious tone of a man putting the nation on a war footing.And he was addressing people already coming to terms with the crisis, and many who had already absented themselves from normal life as shown by the deserted train stations, empty tracks and carriages and abandoned motorways in and around London and major cities.We huddled round televisions or computer screens to listen to the Prime Minister - just as our parents and grandparents might have gathered round the wireless to listen to Johnson's hero, Winston Churchill, in the Second World War.For once Johnson the compulsive showman resisted the urge to make a wisecrack. He spoke solemnly and carefully.When he became Prime Minister last July, it seemed certain his term in office would be defined by one thing: Brexit.It is a mark of the scale of the coronavirus crisis that Brexit suddenly seems irrelevant. The Brexit talks could stall for years, hit the economy hard, or fail to curb immigration and Johnson could still expect to see out his five year term, albeit diminished in stature. But if the critics who say he is doing too little late to combat coronavirus are proved right, and thousands die needlessly as a result of his miscalculation, he could be evicted from No 10 by the end of the year.So comparing coronavirus to the Blitz is not as fanciful as it may seem.It was in June 1940 that Churchill made his 'their finest hour' speech, rallying the nation behind him. He had been Prime Minister for just one month.Those words prepared frightened Britons for the struggle ahead and its inspiration kept them going right through the war. But Churchill owes his place in history not just to rhetoric.Time and again, he made the right decision, often in the face of opposition from military experts and fellow Allied leaders. In recent days Johnson has faced criticism at home and abroad for his failure last week to order more drastic measures. This was compounded by a series of cackhanded, contradictory announcements in the following days.On Friday morning, the Chief Scientific Officer Sir Patrick Vallance said there was no need to scrap big sporting events: within hours Premiership football bosses took unilateral action to postpone matches until April. Then a Government adviser David Halpern suggested 'herd immunity' was official policy, meaning it was necessary for more than half the population to be infected.Health Secretary Matt Hancock had to be deployed at the weekend to say loud and clear that the main aim was to ensure people did not get the virus.Next it leaked out via a blog by ITV's Robert Peston that the over-70s would have to stay indoors for four months - and could not even take the dog for a walk.This time it was Transport Secretary Grant Shapps came to the rescue with the welcome news that the elderly can still take Rover - and themselves - for a daily 'constitutional' and visits are not vetoed.As it turns out, the new and more restrictive measures announced by Johnson yesterday brings us closer into line with the rest of Europe - with one notable exception. He is sticking to his refusal to order school closures.I have no doubt this is endorsed by the Praetorian Guard flanking him again yesterday, the reassuringly calm and considered Chief Medical Officer Chris Whitty and Sir Patrick, and by the evidence.Equally, this would have been Johnson's own very strong gut instinct and he is a man, we know, who likes to go with his gut.Often he is right.It is, however, a lonely place that he finds himself in and some of Johnson's most recent predecessors in No 10 were similarly subjected to early tests of their crisis handling capabilities - and, whatever their subsequent shortcomings, came through well.Tony Blair captured the nation's mood with his 'People's Princess' response to Diana's death four months after coming to power in 1997.Gordon Brown played a pivotal role in the global response to the financial crash of 2008, while Theresa May won similar plaudits for her strong denunciation of Russia over the 2018 poisoning of double agent Sergei Skripal in Salisbury.The stakes for Johnson are, of course, much higher than they were for Blair, Brown or May.The EU referendum and election landslide proved his ability to lead and inspire. They also showed the courage and vision to go against the grain - and be proved right.No one thought he would have the nerve to defy Prime Minister David Cameron and lead the Brexit campaign in 2016: he did.No one thought he would win that campaign: he did.No one thought he would become Prime Minister and deliver Brexit: he did.No one gave him a hope of winning by a landslide in December: he did.It can't all be luck, though every successful political and military leader needs it.The challenge and the risks confronting Johnson now are truly Churchillian in magnitude. He will need every ounce of judgment, good advice - and yes, luck, he can summon.But he will need even more than that.In his 2014 biography of Churchill, Johnson said one of his greatest qualities was his 'megalopsychia'It is the Ancient Greek phrase for 'great-souled man' and was Aristotle's definition of virtue.Johnson will need that same noble virtue to retain public support as he leads his 'fightback' against coronavirus in the testing times that lie ahead.•The Borisaurus: The Dictionary of Boris Johnson,by Simon Walters is published on 9th April, by Biteback Publishing, priced £12.99.",'herd_immunity,,"(18, ""then a government adviser david halpern suggested 'herd_immunity' was official policy, meaning it was necessary for more than half the population to be infected."")",147
186,186,"Coronavirus: ten days that shook Britain - and changed the nation for ever;How Boris Johnson changed his priorities: save lives first, and then salvage the economy","March 22, 2020 Sunday","There was a moment, when the decisions were made, when they wondered what on earth they had done, how far they had been forced to go. A moment when they sat ""shellshocked"", reflecting on choices that will change Britain for the rest of our lives. ""It took us the weekend to get ourselves into the emotional position where we were comfortable taking the decisions we took,"" a minister said. ""They were massive.""In politics, there is so much overstatement. Not this time. Ten days ago the government was slowly gearing up its response to the coronavirus crisis, downplaying the need for drastic measures. By Monday, Boris Johnson had ordered an expansion of the state not seen since the Second World War to save the National Health Service, an institution formed in the cauldron of that conflict. A wartime-style lockdown of the capital was under active consideration.This weekend, the events of the last week have already changed health policy, changed the economy and are already changing the people involved.The last time the British state began a multiple service attack on a lurking enemy - D-Day in 1944 - it became known as The Longest Day. On Thursday one cabinet minister reflected: ""It feels like the longest week. It felt like Brexit was going to change the country but it is the coronavirus that will do that now.""Senior figures in government are insistent that the changes they made to the virus clampdown were not ""a U-turn"" but a vehicle accelerating faster along a track already laid. In truth, they no more resemble what went before than the space shuttle did a Citroën 2CV.Conversations with more than a dozen ministers and cabinet ministers, special advisers, Downing Street staff and civil servants reveal a human drama, of leaders tested as never before and of the single most frightening warning a British prime minister has received in eight decades.                   A shock to the system                   The meeting that will change British society for a generation took place on the evening of Thursday, March 12. That was when the strategic advisory group of experts (Sage in Whitehall parlance), the government's committee of scientists and medics, gathered to examine modelling from experts at Imperial College London and other institutions.The results were shattering. A week earlier, councils had been warned to expect about 100,000 deaths from Covid-19. Now Chris Whitty, the chief medical officer, and Sir Patrick Vallance, the chief scientific adviser, realised the estimates were wrong.""Unmitigated, the death number was 510,000,"" a senior figure said. ""Mitigated we were told it was going to be 250,000. Once you see a figure of take no further action and a quarter of a million people die, the question you ask is, 'What action?'"" Another insider said: ""There was a collision between the science and reality.""Ministers had been on notice that drastic action might be needed since the virus first emerged in China's Wuhan province in December. In January, Whitty told the cabinet: ""It either stays in China or it will get everywhere."" For two months the government had time to prepare, but Johnson's instincts were to resist a life-changing crackdown. ""There was a lot of talk about how this was just a bit of flu,"" one senior Tory recalled.Dominic Cummings, the prime minister's senior aide, became convinced that Britain would be better able to resist a lethal second wave of the disease next winter if Whitty's prediction that 60% to 80% of the population became infected was right and the UK developed ""herd immunity"".At a private engagement at the end of February, Cummings outlined the government's strategy. Those present say it was ""herd immunity, protect the economy and if that means some pensioners die, too bad"".At the Sage meeting on March 12, a moment now dubbed the ""Domoscene conversion"", Cummings changed his mind. In this ""penny-drop moment"", he realised he had helped set a course for catastrophe. Until this point, the rise in British infections had been below the European average. Now they were above it and on course to emulate Italy, where the picture was bleak. A minister said: ""Seeing what was happening in Italy was the galvanising force across government.""By Friday, March 13, Cummings had become the most outspoken advocate of a tough crackdown. ""Dominic himself had a conversion,"" a senior Tory said. ""He's gone from 'herd immunity and let the old people die', to 'let's shut down the country and the economy.'""Cummings had a ""meeting of minds"" with Matt Hancock, the health secretary, who wanted stronger action to prevent NHS hospitals being swamped. Department of Health officials had impressed on Hancock that the death rate in Wuhan province was 3.4% when the hospitals were overrun and 0.7% elsewhere in China.Johnson had also been queasy about the previous original approach. ""Boris hated the language of 'herd immunity' because it implied that it was OK for people to die,"" a senior source said. ""Matt hated the language because it implied we had given up. You've got to fight.""                   Herd immunity                   The problem for the government was that at the moment herd immunity was being banished from policy, it had become the focus of publicity. That Wednesday, David Halpern of the Whitehall ""nudge unit"" put the phrase in the public domain. Two days later, Vallance repeated the idea on Radio 4. With Italy, France and Spain going into lockdown, the government's critics accused Johnson of refusing to act because he wanted people to get ill.Insiders say it was ""very bumpy"" that Friday. ""The meetings were very messy,"" said one source. But when Johnson gathered his key advisers in the cabinet room at 9.15am last Saturday there was unanimity. Whitty and Vallance explained that Britain had been four weeks behind Italy ""and now we are closer"".The two experts, together with Hancock and Cummings, all delivered to Johnson one message: ""Now is the moment to act."" The prime minister agreed: ""We must work around the clock and take all necessary measures."" One of those present said: ""The mood in the room was astonishing. You could tell that something very significant had shifted.""Flesh was added to the bones in another crunch meeting in Downing Street on Sunday night and again in the 9.15am meetings and bilaterals between Johnson and key cabinet ministers throughout last week.The media was briefed that elderly and vulnerable people might have to self-isolate for a period of months and that everyone else would have to engage in ""social distancing"" - working from home, avoiding groups and unnecessary outings. Most significantly, without a gargantuan package of support for businesses, renters and the self-employed, millions of jobs would be lost and the economy would collapse.                   The economic response                   On Tuesday morning, as he prepared to unveil details of Britain's biggest peacetime financial package, Rishi Sunak, the chancellor, gathered his closest aides and officials in his book-lined study in 11 Downing Street. ""The scale of what is required is beyond anyone's current imagination,"" he said. ""We have to remove all limiting assumptions.""Over the weekend, Treasury officials worked through the night to prepare a package for business as if planning a full budget. ""They did three months' work in 48 hours,"" a Treasury source said. It helped that Charles Roxburgh, the second permanent secretary, and Andrew Bailey, the new governor of the Bank of England, were both veterans of the response to the 2008 financial crash.When he walked out with Johnson for a Downing Street news conference on Tuesday afternoon, aides were still finalising Sunak's comments as the statement came off the printer. The chancellor had no time to rehearse or to prepare for questions but gave an assured performance as he outlined plans for £350bn of government-backed loans and cash grants for business. ""We will do whatever it takes,"" he repeatedly intoned.Colleagues say Sunak's confidence came because he is deeply engaged ""in the weeds"" of the policy. ""Some ministers set the broad parameters for 15 minutes and the officials go away and do the work,"" said one source. ""He's more hands-on.

By Tuesday the news was leaking after a Cabinet Office official emailed other departments to ask how a curfew might work. A Whitehall insider said: ""It was quickly established that the Paris model - with people being issued paperwork and allowed out of the family home one at a time would not work.""A senior Tory said: ""Boris really doesn't want to shut stuff down. He is more worried than most about the economic impact but also the social impact of locking people up in their homes for months. Fundamentally there is a Boris-Dom cleavage.

""We live in a land of liberty,"" he said. ""But we will rule nothing out.""On Thursday the PM's spokesman was forced to say there were ""no plans"" to close down London transport and ""zero prospect"" of restrictions on travel.

Officials have also been working on a ""lockdown list"" of products that must be manufactured by law. They may yet be necessary. A minister said: ""We won't know for two weeks if the current measures are enough.""

Together they devised a slogan ""Stay home. Save lives. Protect our NHS,"" which was rolled out on Friday.The No 10 morning meeting is now held on the Zoom video app to allow more home working. To try to raise morale, Johnson has also sent video messages thanking civil servants for their hard work. On Tuesday he returned from a morning run with his dog Dilyn to find his spokesman, James Slack, at the back of No 10 wishing his mother a happy birthday. Johnson took the phone and spoke to her for 10 minutes.However, many sources report that the Downing Street machine is fast running out of steam. ""Everyone is working to capacity and is absolutely exhausted,"" said one insider. ""It's utter chaos and there is no end in sight.""Businesses phoning up to offer help say Downing Street seems ""swamped"".

""There have been tensions over where responsibilities begin and end,"" one observed. Some ministers are lobbying to see Gove take charge if Johnson is incapacitated with Covid-19 or if he takes paternity leave, though Sunak ranks higher in the cabinet rankings on the gov.uk website and the job is likely to be Raab's, since he is officially ""first secretary of state"".But a minister said: ""Considering the scale of the massive decisions we have been making it has been remarkably collegiate.""Ministers hope the dramatic events of the last week will reduce the likely death toll from Covid-19 to ""a bad seasonal flu"", which means tens, not hundreds, of thousands of deaths. The worst recent year was 2014-15 when 28,000 people died.But there are perils ahead. ""Boris and his team are absolutely terrified because it will not be the NHS by end of this,"" a Whitehall source said. ""It will be the corona health service and will just be there to pump oxygen into patients.""MPs speculate that there will be two big inquiries - an international one into the origins of the virus in China's live animal ""wet markets""; and a second into the government's preparations and policy decisions. ""If we end up like Italy in two weeks' time and 30-year-old doctors are dropping dead, the government is going to be in big trouble,"" a Labour MP said.                   Shaking the world                   Amid the frenzy of events, more thoughtful Tories have concluded that the decisions taken last week will change three key aspects of the way the world works. One said: ""One is the debate around globalisation. Is Trump right that we just need to build bigger walls, or is Gordon Brown right that global problems need global solutions? The second is Socialism v The Free Market. Large parts of the economy are going to be socialised after this.

A moment when they sat ""shellshocked"", reflecting on choices that will change Britain for the rest of our lives. ""It took us the weekend to get ourselves into the emotional position where we were comfortable taking the decisions we took,"" a minister said. ""They were massive.""In politics, there is so much overstatement. Not this time. Ten days ago the government was slowly gearing up its response to the coronavirus crisis, downplaying the need for drastic measures. By Monday, Boris Johnson had ordered an expansion of the state not seen since the Second World War to save the National Health Service, an institution formed in the cauldron of that conflict. A wartime-style lockdown of the capital was under active consideration.This weekend, the events of the last week have already changed health policy, changed the economy and are already changing the people involved.The last time the British state began a multiple service attack on a lurking enemy - D-Day in 1944 - it became known as The Longest Day. On Thursday one cabinet minister reflected: ""It feels like the longest week. It felt like Brexit was going to change the country but it is the coronavirus that will do that now.""Senior figures in government are insistent that the changes they made to the virus clampdown were not ""a U-turn"" but a vehicle accelerating faster along a track already laid. In truth, they no more resemble what went before than the space shuttle did a Citroën 2CV.Conversations with more than a dozen ministers and cabinet ministers, special advisers, Downing Street staff and civil servants reveal a human drama, of leaders tested as never before and of the single most frightening warning a British prime minister has received in eight decades.                   A shock to the system                   The meeting that will change British society for a generation took place on the evening of Thursday, March 12. That was when the strategic advisory group of experts (Sage in Whitehall parlance), the government's committee of scientists and medics, gathered to examine modelling from experts at Imperial College London and other institutions.The results were shattering. A week earlier, councils had been warned to expect about 100,000 deaths from Covid-19. Now Chris Whitty, the chief medical officer, and Sir Patrick Vallance, the chief scientific adviser, realised the estimates were wrong.""Unmitigated, the death number was 510,000,"" a senior figure said. ""Mitigated we were told it was going to be 250,000. Once you see a figure of take no further action and a quarter of a million people die, the question you ask is, 'What action?'"" Another insider said: ""There was a collision between the science and reality.""Ministers had been on notice that drastic action might be needed since the virus first emerged in China's Wuhan province in December. In January, Whitty told the cabinet: ""It either stays in China or it will get everywhere."" For two months the government had time to prepare, but Johnson's instincts were to resist a life-changing crackdown. ""There was a lot of talk about how this was just a bit of flu,"" one senior Tory recalled.Dominic Cummings, the prime minister's senior aide, became convinced that Britain would be better able to resist a lethal second wave of the disease next winter if Whitty's prediction that 60% to 80% of the population became infected was right and the UK developed ""herd immunity"".At a private engagement at the end of February, Cummings outlined the government's strategy. Those present say it was ""herd immunity, protect the economy and if that means some pensioners die, too bad"".At the Sage meeting on March 12, a moment now dubbed the ""Domoscene conversion"", Cummings changed his mind. In this ""penny-drop moment"", he realised he had helped set a course for catastrophe. Until this point, the rise in British infections had been below the European average. Now they were above it and on course to emulate Italy, where the picture was bleak. A minister said: ""Seeing what was happening in Italy was the galvanising force across government.""By Friday, March 13, Cummings had become the most outspoken advocate of a tough crackdown. ""Dominic himself had a conversion,"" a senior Tory said. ""He's gone from 'herd immunity and let the old people die', to 'let's shut down the country and the economy.'""Cummings had a ""meeting of minds"" with Matt Hancock, the health secretary, who wanted stronger action to prevent NHS hospitals being swamped. Department of Health officials had impressed on Hancock that the death rate in Wuhan province was 3.4% when the hospitals were overrun and 0.7% elsewhere in China.Johnson had also been queasy about the previous original approach. ""Boris hated the language of 'herd immunity' because it implied that it was OK for people to die,"" a senior source said. ""Matt hated the language because it implied we had given up. You've got to fight.""                   Herd immunity                   The problem for the government was that at the moment herd immunity was being banished from policy, it had become the focus of publicity. That Wednesday, David Halpern of the Whitehall ""nudge unit"" put the phrase in the public domain. Two days later, Vallance repeated the idea on Radio 4. With Italy, France and Spain going into lockdown, the government's critics accused Johnson of refusing to act because he wanted people to get ill.Insiders say it was ""very bumpy"" that Friday. ""The meetings were very messy,"" said one source. But when Johnson gathered his key advisers in the cabinet room at 9.15am last Saturday there was unanimity. Whitty and Vallance explained that Britain had been four weeks behind Italy ""and now we are closer"".The two experts, together with Hancock and Cummings, all delivered to Johnson one message: ""Now is the moment to act."" The prime minister agreed: ""We must work around the clock and take all necessary measures."" One of those present said: ""The mood in the room was astonishing. You could tell that something very significant had shifted.""Flesh was added to the bones in another crunch meeting in Downing Street on Sunday night and again in the 9.15am meetings and bilaterals between Johnson and key cabinet ministers throughout last week.The media was briefed that elderly and vulnerable people might have to self-isolate for a period of months and that everyone else would have to engage in ""social distancing"" - working from home, avoiding groups and unnecessary outings. Most significantly, without a gargantuan package of support for businesses, renters and the self-employed, millions of jobs would be lost and the economy would collapse.                   The economic response                   On Tuesday morning, as he prepared to unveil details of Britain's biggest peacetime financial package, Rishi Sunak, the chancellor, gathered his closest aides and officials in his book-lined study in 11 Downing Street. ""The scale of what is required is beyond anyone's current imagination,"" he said. ""We have to remove all limiting assumptions.""Over the weekend, Treasury officials worked through the night to prepare a package for business as if planning a full budget. ""They did three months' work in 48 hours,"" a Treasury source said. It helped that Charles Roxburgh, the second permanent secretary, and Andrew Bailey, the new governor of the Bank of England, were both veterans of the response to the 2008 financial crash.When he walked out with Johnson for a Downing Street news conference on Tuesday afternoon, aides were still finalising Sunak's comments as the statement came off the printer. The chancellor had no time to rehearse or to prepare for questions but gave an assured performance as he outlined plans for £350bn of government-backed loans and cash grants for business. ""We will do whatever it takes,"" he repeatedly intoned.Colleagues say Sunak's confidence came because he is deeply engaged ""in the weeds"" of the policy. ""Some ministers set the broad parameters for 15 minutes and the officials go away and do the work,"" said one source. ""He's more hands-on. He prefers a 30 to 40-minute meeting where he can properly kick the tyres and help solve the problems. He's across the detail.""Measures to help save jobs took longer, with a plan for the government to pay a high percentage of wages in cash-strapped firms finally being announced on Friday afternoon. Sunak agreed the package in a meeting with Johnson on Thursday night in which the pair shared a vegetarian takeaway pizza. The prime minister said: ""In 2008, the government looked after the bankers. Now we must make sure we look after the people first.""At 11.30pm the chancellor was sending messages to his permanent secretary thanking him for the ""superb"" work of some officials. A colleague said: ""He's got the brainpower. More importantly, he's got the character for this moment.""Sunak will need it because the risks are immense. One friend said: ""Rishi is very acutely aware that we are in danger of driving the economy off a cliff by shutting everything up. All this talk of bouncing straight back . . . we will have no airlines to bounce straight back with if we're not careful.""The prime minister's big decision on Wednesday was that schools would close on Friday, a decision arrived at with Gavin Williamson, the education secretary.

Whitty and Vallance explained that Britain had been four weeks behind Italy ""and now we are closer"".The two experts, together with Hancock and Cummings, all delivered to Johnson one message: ""Now is the moment to act."" The prime minister agreed: ""We must work around the clock and take all necessary measures."" One of those present said: ""The mood in the room was astonishing. You could tell that something very significant had shifted.""Flesh was added to the bones in another crunch meeting in Downing Street on Sunday night and again in the 9.15am meetings and bilaterals between Johnson and key cabinet ministers throughout last week.The media was briefed that elderly and vulnerable people might have to self-isolate for a period of months and that everyone else would have to engage in ""social distancing"" - working from home, avoiding groups and unnecessary outings. Most significantly, without a gargantuan package of support for businesses, renters and the self-employed, millions of jobs would be lost and the economy would collapse.THE ECONOMIC RESPONSE On Tuesday morning, as he prepared to unveil details of Britain's biggest peacetime financial package, Rishi Sunak, the chancellor, gathered his closest aides and officials in his book-lined study in 11 Downing Street. ""The scale of what is required is beyond anyone's current imagination,"" he said. ""We have to remove all limiting assumptions.""Over the weekend, Treasury officials worked through the night to prepare a package for business as if planning a full budget. ""They did three months' work in 48 hours,"" a Treasury source said. It helped that Charles Roxburgh, the second permanent secretary, and Andrew Bailey, the new governor of the Bank of England, were both veterans of the response to the 2008 financial crash.When he walked out with Johnson for a Downing Street news conference on Tuesday afternoon, aides were still finalising Sunak's comments as the statement came off the printer. The chancellor had no time to rehearse or to prepare for questions but gave an assured performance as he outlined plans for £350bn of government-backed loans and cash grants for business. ""We will do whatever it takes,"" he repeatedly intoned.Colleagues say Sunak's confidence came because he is deeply engaged ""in the weeds"" of the policy. ""Some ministers set the broad parameters for 15 minutes and the officials go away and do the work,"" said one source. ""He's more hands-on. He prefers a 30 to 40-minute meeting where he can properly kick the tyres and help solve the problems. He's across the detail.""Measures to help save jobs took longer, with a plan for the government to pay a high percentage of wages in cashstrapped firms finally being announced on Friday afternoon. Sunak agreed the package in a meeting with Johnson on Thursday night in which the pair shared a vegetarian takeaway pizza. The prime minister said: ""In 2008, the government looked after the bankers. Now we must make sure we look after the people first.""At 11.30pm the chancellor was sending messages to his permanent secretary thanking him for the ""superb"" work of some officials. A colleague said: ""He's got the brainpower. More importantly, he's got the character for this moment.""Sunak will need it because the risks are immense. One friend said: ""Rishi is very acutely aware that we are in danger of driving the economy off a cliff by shutting everything up. All this talk of bouncing straight back … we will have no airlines to bounce straight back with if we're not careful.""The prime minister's big decision on Wednesday was that schools would close on Friday, a decision arrived at with Gavin Williamson, the education secretary. They decided to act as many schools took matters into their own hands, to try to ensure childcare for key workers.It was another decision Johnson had resisted the week before, but cabinet ministers are clear that behind the scenes he has been far more decisive at crunch moments than his predecessor. ""He's been absolutely brilliant,"" said one. ""He makes decisions fast."" Another said: ""If Theresa May was still be in charge we would, by now, have just about signed off a request that people wash their hands."" Another cabinet source added: ""And if Philip Hammond was still chancellor he would have refused even to pay for that.""Nonetheless, even admirers admit that Johnson is not finding it easy to project the same decisiveness in his somewhat hesitant public appearances. ""He's a naturally cheerful person,"" one colleague said. ""He finds it difficult to deliver bad news."" Business leaders were surprised during a conference call on Monday, when he was trying to persuade them to build ventilators, to hear him describe the effort as ""Operation Last Gasp"".Whitty and Vallance began their own press conferences at the end of the week amid concern that some of Johnson's pronouncements - including a claim that they could ""turn the tide"" within 12 weeks - were not grounded in evidence. ""Some of the experts are appalled by some of his claims,"" a Whitehall source said. A Tory aide said: ""Boris looks haunted. It's like when George W Bush came in thinking he was going to be the education-reforming president and had to deal with the war on terror."" Another senior Tory said: ""Boris is shellshocked.""LOCKDOWN Johnson, who is a civil libertarian at heart, spent the week resisting Cummings's demands for a full-blown lockdown of London - banning inhabitants from travelling outside the city.Discussions about a shutdown were first aired at Cobra on Friday, March 13. By Tuesday the news was leaking after a Cabinet Office official emailed other departments to ask how a curfew might work. A Whitehall insider said: ""It was quickly established that the Paris model - with people being issued paperwork and allowed out of the family home one at a time would not work.""A senior Tory said: ""Boris really doesn't want to shut stuff down. He is more worried than most about the economic impact but also the social impact of locking people up in their homes for months. Fundamentally there is a Boris-Dom cleavage. First Boris bottled herd immunity. Now he's bottling lockdown.""Nonetheless, Johnson managed to fuel speculation that there would be troops on the streets and a travel ban by telling Wednesday's press conference that the government ""will not hesitate"" to take further steps. ""We live in a land of liberty,"" he said. ""But we will rule nothing out.""On Thursday the PM's spokesman was forced to say there were ""no plans"" to close down London transport and ""zero prospect"" of restrictions on travel. On Friday less draconian restrictions, closing pubs, clubs and restaurants nationwide, were unveiled. ""Whoever was briefing details of the full lockdown is bordering on a national security threat,"" said one Tory with links at the top of Whitehall. ""They are promulgating misinformation and spreading alarm."" Another source said the loose talk could have seen wealthy ""superspreaders"" flee London to infect people elsewhere: ""If you're going to do a lockdown you don't tell people first or you find they are all on the roof getting the last helicopter out of Saigon.""Nonetheless, Whitehall officials are quietly drawing up lists of key workers who would be issued with a travel permit if a full crackdown follows. Officials have also been working on a ""lockdown list"" of products that must be manufactured by law. They may yet be necessary. A minister said: ""We won't know for two weeks if the current measures are enough.""COMMUNICATION PROBLEMS On Thursday, after criticism from ministers and MPs that No 10 had failed to pro-vide clear messages to the public, Cummings and the communications director, Lee Cain, summoned the team who won the general election.Isaac Levido, the Tory campaign director, went to No 10, with former Vote Leave hands Paul Stephenson and Henry de Zoete on a video conference call. Together they devised a slogan ""Stay home. Save lives. Protect our NHS,"" which was rolled out on Friday.The No 10 morning meeting is now held on the Zoom video app to allow more home working. To try to raise morale, Johnson has also sent video messages thanking civil servants for their hard work. On Tuesday he returned from a morning run with his dog Dilyn to find his spokesman, James Slack, at the back of No 10 wishing his mother a happy birthday. Johnson took the phone and spoke to her for 10 minutes.However, many sources report that the Downing Street machine is fast running out of steam. ""Everyone is working to capacity and is absolutely exhausted,"" said one insider. ""It's utter chaos and there is no end in sight.""Businesses phoning up to offer help say Downing Street seems ""swamped"". One ventilator manufacturer claimed on Newsnight that the government had not put in any orders - though sources say 1,400 firms are offering to build them and by Friday morning eight companies who have never made a ventilator were turning them out.Some in Downing Street are turning to drink. An aide joked on Thursday that they had run out of hand sanitiser and were ""using the contents of a vodka miniature"" instead. Others are recruiting old friends. Gabriel Milland, a former head of press to Michael Gove, was drafted into No 10 last week. Tom Shinner, the civil servant who did the most to prepare Britain for a no-deal Brexit, who left the government last year, has also been rehired.MINISTERIAL INFIGHTING The toll is telling on ministers and tensions between them have bubbled over. ""It's miserable and horrible and you just have to get on with it,"" a cabinet minister said.The ""core four"" in all the key meetings are the chairmen of four inter-ministerial committees: Dominic Raab, the foreign secretary, who chairs the international committee; Sunak, who chairs the economic committee; Hancock, who chairs the health committee; and Gove, who chairs the other public sector committee.Numerous sources say Gove has repeatedly sniped at Hancock. ""There have been tensions over where responsibilities begin and end,"" one observed. Some ministers are lobbying to see Gove take charge if Johnson is incapacitated with Covid-19 or if he takes paternity leave, though Sunak ranks higher in the cabinet rankings on the www.gov.uk website and the job is likely to be Raab's, since he is officially ""first secretary of state"".But a minister said: ""Considering the scale of the massive decisions we have been making it has been remarkably collegiate.""Ministers hope the dramatic events of the last week will reduce the likely death toll from Covid-19 to ""a bad seasonal flu"", which means tens, not hundreds, of thousands of deaths. The worst recent year was 2014-15 when 28,000 people died.But there are perils ahead. ""Boris and his team are absolutely terrified because it will not be the NHS by end of this,"" a Whitehall source said. ""It will be the corona health service and will just be there to pump oxygen into patients.""MPs speculate that there will be two big inquiries - an international one into the origins of the virus in China's live animal ""wet markets""; and a second into the government's preparations and policy decisions. ""If we end up like Italy in two weeks' time and 30-year-old doctors are dropping dead, the government is going to be in big trouble,"" a Labour MP said.SHAKING THE WORLD Amid the frenzy of events, more thoughtful Tories have concluded that the decisions taken last week will change three key aspects of the way the world works. One said: ""One is the debate around globalisation. Is Trump right that we just need to build bigger walls, or is Gordon Brown right that global problems need global solutions? The second is Socialism v The Free Market. Large parts of the economy are going to be socialised after this. I fear it leads to nationalists and socialists winning, to national socialism.""The third fissure may yet be the worst.""It's the intergenerational question. It is unsustainable to have people in their youth put their whole life on hold for months while the economy tanks to save a 91-year-old who would have died six months later anyway.""Whatever the outcome, ministers have little doubt about the significance of the virus. ""It's shaking the world,"" one said. Another, who has been up to his neck in the dramas of the past three years, was more prosaic: ""My obituary gets more interesting every week.""The sadness is that there will be many other obituaries to be written too.The PM was told: Now is the moment to actDon't tell people you're going into lockdown or they'll all be getting on the last helicopter out",'herd_immunity,,"(37, '""he\'s gone from \'herd_immunity and let the old people die\', to \'let\'s shut down the country and the economy.\'""')",177
191,191,"Ten days that shook Britain - and changed the nation for ever;The inside story of how Boris Johnson changed his priorities: save lives first, and then salvage the economy","March 22, 2020 Sunday","There was a moment, when the decisions were made, when they wondered what on earth they had done, how far they had been forced to go. A moment when they sat ""shellshocked"", reflecting on choices that will change Britain for the rest of our lives. ""It took us the weekend to get ourselves into the emotional position where we were comfortable taking the decisions we took,"" a minister said. ""They were massive.""In politics, there is so much overstatement. Not this time. Ten days ago the government was slowly gearing up its response to the coronavirus crisis, downplaying the need for drastic measures. By Monday, Boris Johnson had ordered an expansion of the state not seen since the Second World War to save the National Health Service, an institution formed in the cauldron of that conflict. A wartimestyle lockdown of the capital was under active consideration.This weekend, the events of the last week have already changed health policy, changed the economy and are already changing the people involved.The last time the British state began a multiple service attack on a lurking enemy - D-Day in 1944 - it became known as The Longest Day. On Thursday one cabinet minister reflected: ""It feels like the longest week. It felt like Brexit was going to change the country but it is the coronavirus that will do that now.""Senior figures in government are insistent that the changes they made to the virus clampdown were not ""a U-turn"" but a vehicle accelerating faster along a track already laid. In truth, they no more resemble what went before than the space shuttle did a Citroën 2CV.Conversations with more than a dozen ministers and cabinet ministers, special advisers, Downing Street staff and civil servants reveal a human drama, of leaders tested as never before and of the single most frightening warning a British prime minister has received in eight decades.A SHOCK TO THE SYSTEM The meeting that will change British society for a generation took place on the evening of Thursday, March 12. That was when the strategic advisory group of experts (Sage in Whitehall parlance), the government's committee of scientists and medics, gathered to examine modelling from experts at Imperial College London and other institutions.The results were shattering. A week earlier, councils had been warned to expect about 100,000 deaths from Covid-19. Now Chris Whitty, the chief medical officer, and Sir Patrick Vallance, the chief scientific adviser, realised the estimates were wrong.""Unmitigated, the death number was 510,000,"" a senior figure said. ""Mitigated we were told it was going to be 250,000. Once you see a figure of take no further action and a quarter of a million people die, the question you ask is, 'What action?'"" Another insider said: ""There was a collision between the science and reality.""Ministers had been on notice that drastic action might be needed since the virus first emerged in China's Wuhan province in December. In January, Whitty told the cabinet: ""It either stays in China or it will get everywhere."" For two months the government had time to prepare, but Johnson's instincts were to resist a lifechanging crackdown. ""There was a lot of talk about how this was just a bit of flu,"" one senior Tory recalled.Dominic Cummings, the prime minister's senior aide, became convinced that Britain would be better able to resist a lethal second wave of the disease next winter if Whitty's prediction that 60% to 80% of the population became infected was right and the UK developed ""herd immunity"".At a private engagement at the end of February, Cummings outlined the government's strategy. Those present say it was ""herd immunity, protect the economy and if that means some pensioners die, too bad"".At the Sage meeting on March 12, a moment now dubbed the ""Domoscene conversion"", Cummings changed his mind. In this ""penny-drop moment"", he realised he had helped set a course for catastrophe. Until this point, the rise in British infections had been below the European average. Now they were above it and on course to emulate Italy, where the picture was bleak. A minister said: ""Seeing what was happening in Italy was the galvanising force across government.""By Friday the 13th, Cummings had become the most outspoken advocate of a tough crackdown. ""Dominic himself had a conversion,"" a senior Tory said. ""He's gone from 'herd immunity and let the old people die', to 'let's shut down the country and the economy.'"" Cummings had a ""meeting of minds"" with Matt Hancock, the health secretary, who wanted stronger action to prevent NHS hospitals being swamped. Department of Health officials had impressed on Hancock that the death rate in Wuhan province was 3.4% when the hospitals were overrun and 0.7% elsewhere in China.Johnson had also been queasy about the previous original approach. ""Boris hated the language of 'herd immunity' because it implied that it was OK for people to die,"" a senior source said. ""Matt hated the language because it implied we had given up. You've got to fight.""HERD IMMUNITY The problem for the government was that at the moment herd immunity was being banished from policy, it had become the focus of publicity. That Wednesday, David Halpern of the Whitehall ""nudge unit"" put the phrase in the public domain. On Friday the 13th, Vallance repeated the idea on Radio 4. With Italy, France and Spain going into lockdown, the government's critics accused Johnson of refusing to act because he wanted people to get ill.Insiders say it was ""very bumpy"" that Friday. ""The meetings were very messy,"" said one source. But when Johnson gathered his key advisers in the cabinet room at 9.15am last Saturday there was unanimity.

273,273,"How the Government's 25,000-a-day coronavirus testing pledge descended into chaos;The UK Government has failed on its pledge to perform 25,000 coronavirus tests a day, despite the World Health Organisation calling on all countries to 'test, test, test' in order to beat the epidemic","April 2, 2020 Thursday","The Government's pledge to perform 25,000 coronavirus tests a day has unravelled into a fiasco.The country is still struggling to test 10,000 people a day for Covid-19 nationwide, weeks after the pandemic reached British shores.Meanwhile Germany is conducting 50,000 tests a day and the country has a much lower death rate than that of the UK.The World Health Organisation WHO has urged countries to 'test, test, test' to try and get on top of the outbreak.On Wednesday 10,657 tests were carried out in the UK with the capacity for 12,799.But numbers overall remain low and yesterday No10 said just 2,000 frontline NHS staff, out of 500,000 in England, have been tested since the outbreak began.As of 5pm on Wednesday the overall number of deaths from the virus in the UK was 2,921.The fact that the number is currently low and is likely to remain so for the foreseeable future can be explained by the following reasons.                      Communication breakdown 'reduces testing capacity by tens of thousands'                   A breakdown in communication between Public Health England PHE and the government's animal health agency may have reduced the UK's testing capacity by tens of thousands per week, it has been claimed.Employees at Animal and Plant Health Agency APHA have been in discussion with PHE for more than two months about supporting testing efforts, reports BuzzFeed News.The news website reports that they have seen evidence of PHE sending APHA, which tests diseases among animals, conflicting information about recruiting and training scientists.One APHA scientist told BuzzFeed News: ""We're not even getting a consistent message about what they want us to do,"" adding that the miscommunication with PHE was ""appalling"".                     'Herd immunity' strategy suggested by Government                   As the coronavirus outbreak began to worsen in early March members of the Government's 'nudge unit' appeared to favour a strategy of herd immunity.Dr David Halpern, a psychologist who heads the Behavioural Insights Team, said on BBC News: ""There's going to be a point, assuming the epidemic flows and grows, as we think it probably will do, where you'll want to cocoon, you'll want to protect those at-risk groups so that they basically don't catch the disease and by the time they come out of their cocooning, herd immunity's been achieved in the rest of the population.""To reach herd immunity, about 60% of the population would need to get ill and become immune, according to Sir Patrick Vallance, the government's chief scientific adviser.Martin Hibberd, professor of emerging infectious disease at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, said: ""I do worry that making plans that assume such a large proportion of the population will become infected and hopefully recovered and immune may not be the very best that we can do.""Within a week the 'herd immunity' strategy was scrapped and replaced with 'suppression' with social-distancing measures quickly ramped up.Speaking to BBC Newsnight former Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt, who had earlier criticised the 'herd immunity' strategy said: ""We changed our strategy a couple of weeks ago from the herd immunity strategy to the suppression strategy.""                     Government pledge to perform 10,000 tests a day                   On March 18 -roughly six weeks after the first confirmed case of Covid-19 in the UK -the Government pledged that 10,000 tests a day would be performed by the week after.That target was finally reached on April 1 when 10,657 tests were carried out.Also on March 18, the Government said that 25,000 tests a day would be carried out 'within four weeks'.There's no indication that they will be able to reach that target but today Prof Paul Cosford of Public Health England PHE said that testing would hit 15,000 per day ""imminently"".                     Government U-turn on the importance of testing                   Last week England's deputy chief medical officer Jenny Harries said: ""There comes a point in a pandemic when testing of every case is not an appropriate intervention and that is the point where we moved.""Although we still do some contact tracing and testing, for example in high-risk areas like prisons and care homes, that is not an appropriate mechanism as we go forward.""However in a video message on Twitter on Wednesday evening, Mr Johnson said that increased screening would be how the UK defeats the coronavirus.""I want to say a special word about testing, because it is so important, and as I have said for weeks and weeks, this is the way through,"" he said.""This is how we will unlock the coronavirus puzzle.

Muddled facts on NHS frontline staff testing                   On Wednesday the government said 2,000 NHS staff had been tested -despite claims more than 100,000 are off sick or self-isolating.On Thursday Downing Street clarified that the testing number was in fact higher than previously said.No10 said there were actually two strands of testing for NHS staff -drive-through tests, which have now tested 2,800 staff, plus testing within NHS labs of frontline staff.The government claimed that this second section has tested a ""significant number"" of NHS staff, but said the numbers will only be set out in full later on Thursday.Meanwhile, a new lab in Milton Keynes has now started taking samples from NHS staff, No10 claimed.Downing Street said nearly 100 universities, companies and research institutes agreed to lend their machines for the Milton Keynes effort and ""not a single institution that was asked refused"".                     Spare capacity to be used on NHS staff                   Government ministers said on Tuesday night that they would finally start using spare capacity to test NHS staff, after even the UK's limited testing capacity went unfilled despite enormous demand.It's understood the gap between coronavirus testing capacity and actual tests was due to a 15% cap on staff tests, with 85% reserved for patients.When medics were unable to fill the 85% patient quota, testing capacity went unused.With testing capacity increasing, Health Secretary Matt Hancock told the NHS to remove the cap, so all spare capacity can be used for staff and families from Wednesday.                     'Dunkirk-like effort' needed to increase test numbers dramatically                   Sir Paul Nurse, chief executive of the Francis Crick research institute -which will soon be able to conduct 500 Covid-19 tests a day -said a Dunkirk-style effort was needed to co-ordinate smaller laboratories and increase test numbers.""We are a lot of little boats and the little boats can be effective,"" he said, referring to the evacuation of Allied troops from the beaches of the French city during World War Two.He added: ""The government has put some big boats, destroyers in place. That's a bit more cumbersome to get working and we wish them all the luck to do that, but we little boats can contribute as well.""                                            A lack of materials and lab space                                        A global shortage of key chemicals called reagents is hampering the production of tests, No10 claimed this week. According to the British In Vitro Diagnostic Association, companies are working to meet demand, but the chemicals needed for different testing machines are different and the production complex. While reagent supply issues were sighted by Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, Michael Gove, as a reason for the slow production of tests, this claimed was thrown into doubt on Tuesday. The Chemical Industries Association, which represents the UK's substantial chemicals industry, told ITV that there was no shortage. What is certain however, is the fact that too little lab space has been designated for scientists to look at the tests. At first, Public Health England was only using its own eight laboratories. This has been expanded to 40 NHS labs, meaning 48 labs in total are now operational.                      No test is better than a bad test                   Professor Chris Whitty, England's chief medical officer, has issued a note of caution about rushing out tests that are not ready. ""One thing worse than no test is a bad test,"" arguing that an infected doctor or nurse falsely given the all clear could spread the virus through a large portion of a hospital.

How is the Government planning to rectify this                    Today Matt Hancock said that he would be ""pressing the accelerator"" on coronavirus testing before unveiling a five-point plan that he claimed would see the UK eventually reach 100,000 tests a day.Part of the plan is to harness the capabilities of the UK private sector. In a conference call with manufacturers, inventors and commercial developers last night, the Health Secretary asked them to urgently create a major UK diagnostic capability, in line with that in Germany.When asked about the details of the plan, Prime Minister Boris Johnson's spokesman said that following complaints of shortages, the NHS had developed a new specification for the swabs used to carry out the tests which had been validated and shared with potential manufacturers.""We think that provides us with a way forward to complete hundreds of thousands of tests,"" he said.Following the opening of a large-scale testing laboratory in Milton Keynes in just a week, the spokesman said two more would be opening next week in Cheshire and Glasgow to cover the north of England and Scotland.At the same time, the spokesman said the Government was working with nine potential suppliers on developing an antibody test which would show whether people have had the virus.",'nudge_unit,,"(10, ""'herd_immunity' strategy suggested by government                   as the coronavirus outbreak began to worsen in early march members of the government's 'nudge_unit' appeared to favour a strategy of herd_immunity."")",227

Communication breakdown 'reduces testing capacity by tens of thousands'                   A breakdown in communication between Public Health England PHE and the government's animal health agency may have reduced the UK's testing capacity by tens of thousands per week, it has been claimed.Employees at Animal and Plant Health Agency APHA have been in discussion with PHE for more than two months about supporting testing efforts, reports BuzzFeed News.The news website reports that they have seen evidence of PHE sending APHA, which tests diseases among animals, conflicting information about recruiting and training scientists.One APHA scientist told BuzzFeed News: ""We're not even getting a consistent message about what they want us to do,"" adding that the miscommunication with PHE was ""appalling"".                     'Herd immunity' strategy suggested by Government                   As the coronavirus outbreak began to worsen in early March members of the Government's 'nudge unit' appeared to favour a strategy of herd immunity.Dr David Halpern, a psychologist who heads the Behavioural Insights Team, said on BBC News: ""There's going to be a point, assuming the epidemic flows and grows, as we think it probably will do, where you'll want to cocoon, you'll want to protect those at-risk groups so that they basically don't catch the disease and by the time they come out of their cocooning, herd immunity's been achieved in the rest of the population.""To reach herd immunity, about 60% of the population would need to get ill and become immune, according to Sir Patrick Vallance, the government's chief scientific adviser.Martin Hibberd, professor of emerging infectious disease at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, said: ""I do worry that making plans that assume such a large proportion of the population will become infected and hopefully recovered and immune may not be the very best that we can do.""Within a week the 'herd immunity' strategy was scrapped and replaced with 'suppression' with social-distancing measures quickly ramped up.Speaking to BBC Newsnight former Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt, who had earlier criticised the 'herd immunity' strategy said: ""We changed our strategy a couple of weeks ago from the herd immunity strategy to the suppression strategy.""                     Government pledge to perform 10,000 tests a day                   On March 18 -roughly six weeks after the first confirmed case of Covid-19 in the UK -the Government pledged that 10,000 tests a day would be performed by the week after.That target was finally reached on April 1 when 10,657 tests were carried out.Also on March 18, the Government said that 25,000 tests a day would be carried out 'within four weeks'.There's no indication that they will be able to reach that target but today Prof Paul Cosford of Public Health England PHE said that testing would hit 15,000 per day ""imminently"".                     Government U-turn on the importance of testing                   Last week England's deputy chief medical officer Jenny Harries said: ""There comes a point in a pandemic when testing of every case is not an appropriate intervention and that is the point where we moved.""Although we still do some contact tracing and testing, for example in high-risk areas like prisons and care homes, that is not an appropriate mechanism as we go forward.""However in a video message on Twitter on Wednesday evening, Mr Johnson said that increased screening would be how the UK defeats the coronavirus.""I want to say a special word about testing, because it is so important, and as I have said for weeks and weeks, this is the way through,"" he said.""This is how we will unlock the coronavirus puzzle. This is how we will defeat it in the end.""At roughly the same time the prime minister's video was being posted on Twitter on Wednesday night, Jonathan Van Tam, also a deputy chief medical officer, told ITV's Robert Peston that testing was a ""side issue"" for reducing deaths.                     Muddled facts on NHS frontline staff testing                   On Wednesday the government said 2,000 NHS staff had been tested -despite claims more than 100,000 are off sick or self-isolating.On Thursday Downing Street clarified that the testing number was in fact higher than previously said.No10 said there were actually two strands of testing for NHS staff -drive-through tests, which have now tested 2,800 staff, plus testing within NHS labs of frontline staff.The government claimed that this second section has tested a ""significant number"" of NHS staff, but said the numbers will only be set out in full later on Thursday.Meanwhile, a new lab in Milton Keynes has now started taking samples from NHS staff, No10 claimed.Downing Street said nearly 100 universities, companies and research institutes agreed to lend their machines for the Milton Keynes effort and ""not a single institution that was asked refused"".                     Spare capacity to be used on NHS staff                   Government ministers said on Tuesday night that they would finally start using spare capacity to test NHS staff, after even the UK's limited testing capacity went unfilled despite enormous demand.It's understood the gap between coronavirus testing capacity and actual tests was due to a 15% cap on staff tests, with 85% reserved for patients.When medics were unable to fill the 85% patient quota, testing capacity went unused.With testing capacity increasing, Health Secretary Matt Hancock told the NHS to remove the cap, so all spare capacity can be used for staff and families from Wednesday.                     'Dunkirk-like effort' needed to increase test numbers dramatically                   Sir Paul Nurse, chief executive of the Francis Crick research institute -which will soon be able to conduct 500 Covid-19 tests a day -said a Dunkirk-style effort was needed to co-ordinate smaller laboratories and increase test numbers.""We are a lot of little boats and the little boats can be effective,"" he said, referring to the evacuation of Allied troops from the beaches of the French city during World War Two.He added: ""The government has put some big boats, destroyers in place. That's a bit more cumbersome to get working and we wish them all the luck to do that, but we little boats can contribute as well.""                                            A lack of materials and lab space                                        A global shortage of key chemicals called reagents is hampering the production of tests, No10 claimed this week. According to the British In Vitro Diagnostic Association, companies are working to meet demand, but the chemicals needed for different testing machines are different and the production complex. While reagent supply issues were sighted by Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, Michael Gove, as a reason for the slow production of tests, this claimed was thrown into doubt on Tuesday. The Chemical Industries Association, which represents the UK's substantial chemicals industry, told ITV that there was no shortage. What is certain however, is the fact that too little lab space has been designated for scientists to look at the tests. At first, Public Health England was only using its own eight laboratories. This has been expanded to 40 NHS labs, meaning 48 labs in total are now operational.                      No test is better than a bad test                   Professor Chris Whitty, England's chief medical officer, has issued a note of caution about rushing out tests that are not ready. ""One thing worse than no test is a bad test,"" arguing that an infected doctor or nurse falsely given the all clear could spread the virus through a large portion of a hospital. Some scientists have argued that the Government's stringent guidelines when it comes to testing standards, as well as types of reagents and chemicals, needed to be relaxed.""It is holding things up,"" Professor Nicola Stonehouse, a molecular virologist at Leeds University, told The Guardian.""If we could get over this, we could get the testing centres up and running so much faster, and that's got to be a good thing.""                     How is the Government planning to rectify this                    Today Matt Hancock said that he would be ""pressing the accelerator"" on coronavirus testing before unveiling a five-point plan that he claimed would see the UK eventually reach 100,000 tests a day.Part of the plan is to harness the capabilities of the UK private sector. In a conference call with manufacturers, inventors and commercial developers last night, the Health Secretary asked them to urgently create a major UK diagnostic capability, in line with that in Germany.When asked about the details of the plan, Prime Minister Boris Johnson's spokesman said that following complaints of shortages, the NHS had developed a new specification for the swabs used to carry out the tests which had been validated and shared with potential manufacturers.""We think that provides us with a way forward to complete hundreds of thousands of tests,"" he said.Following the opening of a large-scale testing laboratory in Milton Keynes in just a week, the spokesman said two more would be opening next week in Cheshire and Glasgow to cover the north of England and Scotland.At the same time, the spokesman said the Government was working with nine potential suppliers on developing an antibody test which would show whether people have had the virus.",'herd_immunity,,"(15, 'speaking to bbc newsnight former health secretary jeremy hunt, who had earlier criticised the \'herd_immunity\' strategy said: ""we changed our strategy a couple of weeks ago from the herd_immunity strategy to the suppression strategy.""')",230

This began in China in December - it is now virtually everywhere.""Speaking to Sky News, the chief scientific adviser between 2000 and 2008 added: ""We know that what we should have done, early on, is take all sorts of precautionary measures to see that the virus did not get to the level it is now in this country, once we had seen what was happening in China.""But the response has been slow and, I think, because our National Health Service has suffered from underfunding from that 2010 period.""The comments come amid the first signs of public concern about the government's handling of the crisis, despite the prime minister's sky-high poll ratings.According to the survey by Ipsos MORI, 56 per cent believe the social distancing measures were imposed too late, while just four per cent believed they were brought in too soon. It came as the latest official figures showed that 2,921 people have died after contracting the virus in the UK while over 33,000 have tested positive.It was only 10 days ago that Mr Johnson said people should only leave their homes to buy groceries, to exercise once a day or to travel to work if absolutely necessary.Three days earlier, he ordered pubs, bars, restaurants, theatres, cafes and leisure centres to close - having earlier stepped back from doing so.Throughout, ministers have insisted they have followed the advice of their scientists, but that disguises the U-turn when the strategy of aiming for so-called 'herd immunity' in the population was abandoned.The apparent plan to allow the disease to spread among healthier people is blamed for the delays in ordering sufficient testing.Critics say the government ignored public health experts and doctors in favour of behavioural scientists and mathematical modellers.Sir David highlighted the very different approach when the SARS outbreak hit Taiwan, in 2003, when an Imperial College expert was sent immediately to view its impact.",'herd_immunity,,"(14, ""throughout, ministers have insisted they have followed the advice of their scientists, but that disguises the u-turn when the strategy of aiming for so-called 'herd_immunity' in the population was abandoned."")",238
298,298,WHEN WILL IT BE SAFE TO GO BACK TO NORMAL?,"April 5, 2020 Sunday","IT is a crisis many have long feared, and even grimly predicted - but, perhaps, secretly hoped or never quite believed would happen. Not here. Not to us. And yet, here we are. The coronavirus pandemic is surging towards a peak in Britain. Deaths this weekend passed 700 a day- and life has come to a standstill, with our own, and the world's, biggest economies on a knife edge.In the midst of this, deputy chief medical officer Jenny Harries dispatched a chilling warning - that life may not return to normal for at least six months.For the moment, at least, there appears to be no exit strategy, no clear way out. There are no drugs proven to work; no vaccine for at least another 18 months which could protect us. World-leading experts advising the Government are clear: as soon as the lockdown is lifted, infection rates will - not could, will - begin to rise again. We must not suddenly revert to our normal way of living,' Dr Harries told the nation, in the starkest possible terms. That would be quite dangerous.'Dangerous means more lives lost. But the prospect of a lengthy lockdown, with no end in sight, is - to put it mildly - uncomfortable to imagine.Businesses decimated. Thousands of jobs lost. A recession that would make The Great Depression look like a dress rehearsal.Yet there have been glimmers of hope - green shoots', as they have been described - which suggest the rate of infections is starting to slow.It means that, although the peak of the UK's crisis is another week or two away, the Government's social distancing strategy is beginning to take effect.A study by the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine suggests the average number of daily contacts - how many people each of us comes into close contact with on any given day - has reduced from 2.6 to 0.62 since the lockdown. This means, in theory, the virus has nowhere left to go: if none of us are passing it on, no one new will be infected.Not that this means the lockdown restrictions can be lifted yet - far from it.Robert Jenrick, housing and communities secretary, has cautioned that nobody's pretending this will be over in a few weeks'. The BBC announced on Friday that it will be screening a new swathe of educational programmes for 14 weeks from 20 April - the surest sign yet that schools are not expected to return until at least after the summer holidays.The lockdown is working, say experts - but due to the nature of the virus we won't see the full benefit immediately. This weekend is key. One of the country's top epidemiologists Prof Neil Ferguson, who is advising the Government on the outbreak, told yesterday's Today programme: We can [expect to] see two possible options: a very slow plateauing decay of infections over time or perhaps a rather faster one.What's critical to determine that is how well people behave outside the household and how well they restrict their contact with others. And it's quite finely balanced at the current time.'He said moving around in the sunshine this weekend would move us to a slightly more pessimistic scenario' which would lead to high levels of infection for weeks and weeks rather than a rapid decline'.For now, we have to wait until the death and infection rate starts to fall. The big question, however, is this: what then? At the heart of the Government's strategy has been the need to protect the NHS from being overwhelmed - and it will be this which informs its next steps as we try to return to normal.Key to every decision has been our NHS intensive care capacity: at the start of the outbreak, 5,000 beds across the country.When those beds are full, people may start to die because those who need critical care support, such as ventilators, can't access it.But, initially, the Government seemed to adopt a softly, softly approach to the virus.People with symptoms and those who had been to countries where the virus was more prevalent were tested and isolated.Life, for the most of us, went on as normal. By early March, Italy - the first European country to be hit hard by the virus - had joined China in imposing a lockdown to contain the crisis. France, Spain, other European countries, and some US states, quickly followed suit.South Korea, Singapore and Germany engaged in aggressive test and trace' tactics - screening those with symptoms, quarantining the infected and tracing and isolating their contacts. But the UK - alone in Europe, aside from Sweden - stood firm and did neither.On March 12, despite protests from many in the scientific community, the Government stopped testing anyone but those who had been hospitalised with suspected Covid-19.Anyone with a cough or fever - the main symptoms of Covid-19 infection - was told to stay at home, and self-isolate for seven days. But children remained in school.Health officials said they might soon' go further, but they were waiting until this was strictly necessary. If bans on public gatherings and events were introduced too soon, fatigue' might set in - and people would find ways around them. It would also be better economically.Better to save such measures for when Britain was closer to the peak of the epidemic, Government advisers reasoned. But this strategy changed overnight with the publication of a report from the Imperial College Covid-19 Response Team, led by Prof Ferguson, on March 16. It suggested taking no action would lead to a demand for intensive care beds that would be 30 times above capacity, and lead to more than half a million deaths.Crucially, the modelling also found that existing social-distancing measures put demand at eight times greater than capacity, and would cause about 250,000 deaths.Within hours, Boris Johnson announced drastic action'. All Britons should work from home and avoid travel and social contact. Days later, schools closed, pubs and restaurants were ordered to shut and the lockdown began.The success of the initial soft approach will become apparent early this coming week, in the rate of infections and deaths.A few days later, the first signs of the lockdown impact will start to be seen in the figures, too. But neither will give the Government any indication as to what to do next, say leading epidemiologists.It's all a bit muddy, because these changes and interventions all came in within a few days of each other,' says Dr Michael Tildesley, an expert in the modelling of infectious disease at the University of Warwick. It's impossible to predict the effect each measure will have had individually.'Now, there are too many unknowns to simply lift the restrictions, he says. We don't know how many people have been infected because the Government has not been routinely testing those with symptoms.Prof Keith Neal, an epidemiologist in infectious disease from the University of Nottingham, says the global estimate is that there are roughly 1,000 infections for every one death - which puts the UK total, to date, at 4,313,000. But we don't know for sure whether those who have had the virus are, in fact, immune to having it again.While experts have said they have every reason' to think they might be, there are concerns. Other coronaviruses - including the four that cause common colds - do not trigger lasting immunity. So there is no model for how to proceed. The only option is for officials to analyse carefully what happens elsewhere.That begins with China. Travel restrictions in Hubei province - excluding Wuhan, the epicentre of the outbreak - were lifted last week. The lockdown in Wuhan, where there have been no new cases since last Monday, according to officials, is to be partially lifted on April 8.We know already, though, that the lockdown alone isn't enough to combat the virus. As experts have pointed out, we need to learn to live with it'. In China, some shops, cinemas and businesses were abruptly' closed again - suggesting relaxed measures may have prompted further infections.A second wave was also reported in Hong Kong after the two-week quarantine for travellers into the region was lifted and students returned at the end of term. Azra Ghani, Professor of Infectious Disease Epidemiology at Imperial College, says: Every country is facing exactly the same challenges. We're closely monitoring the situation in China. They have reduced transmission to very low levels, and now they are starting to open up their society again.We will see what happens in the coming weeks.'The Imperial report shows that - ironically - the more successful the attempt to contain the spread of infection, the more likely there is to be a significant second peak later in the year.Some experts hope one way out lies in herd immunity. This is when a large enough proportion of a population have had an infection, or been vaccinated. The disease ceases to spread easily - and essentially dies out. But of course, this relies on infection leading to lasting immunity, which, as we have said, isn't yet known.Prof Neal said if the herd immunity theory held true, then countries like Spain and Italy, which struggled to control their outbreaks, or Sweden and Singapore where shops and bars remained open, could have a lower second wave of infection.'Despite being one of the hardest hit areas of the UK, the infection rate in London is, at the moment, estimated to be only between two and five per cent, he said.If a second wave does come to the UK - as predicted in the late autumn - it could be even more catastrophic, coinciding with the annual flu season, which already places huge pressure on the NHS. Many experts say that aside from herd immunity the only other definitive way out is a vaccine - and neither are quick solutions.One possible exit strategy, modelled by Prof Ferguson and backed by a Harvard study last week, involves turning the restrictions on and off intermittently for two years - or until a vaccine becomes available. The aim would be to manage demand on health services by having several smaller peaks of infection rather than one large one.The on' switch would be triggered by the number of patients admitted to ICU who test positive for Covid-19. Prof Ferguson's simulation suggests if that exceeded 200 - four per cent of the UK's pre-outbreak capacity - social distancing measures and school closures could be reintroduced.Dr Tildesley explains: It will take time for interventions to have an effect, so if it is left later than this, even with suppression the peak ICU demand will exceed the capacity.'Herd immunity would continue to build during the periods when lockdowns were relaxed, so the infection rate would slow and there would be increasingly lengthy periods between the restrictions. But many are reluctant to impose intermittent lockdown strategies simply because people would struggle to adhere to them.Ivo Vlaev, Prof of Behavioural Science at Warwick Business School, says: Intermittent lockdown is not a good idea. We are creatures of habit and ever-changing guidelines may create problems. If the Government suddenly lifts the current restrictions and we are all free to do as we choose, we will flow back into our old way of life in many respects, as our ingrained habits will resurface.'Dr Harries has already implied that the Government may look to relax restrictions in stages, following the Chinese model. Over time, probably over the next six months, we will have a review [every three weeks],' she said.We need to keep that lid on, and then gradually we will be able to hopefully adjust some of the social distancing measures and gradually get us back to normal.'A study modelling the effects of ending the lockdown in Wuhan, from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, recommended this staggered approach. It found reintroducing the workforce over four weeks, and then reopening schools, could delay a second peak of infections by two months and make it easier to manage. Prof Neal says: I think we'll go through a staged relaxation of the measures. That might mean continuing to work from home if you can, and reopening pubs and restaurants but keeping tables 15ft apart, like they do in Singapore, or banning gatherings of more than 20 people so there's still a degree of social distancing.Football games could be played behind closed doors. Schools would most likely not go back until September, which could increase the spread. Universities may have to teach online.Ultimately, we may find the restrictions have to be put back in place again.'By the time we have a vaccine, we'll probably also have achieved herd immunity - or close to it, he also suggests.Another solution is lifting the measures in less-affected regions for up to six months at a time, as recommended by the Scientific Pandemic Influenza Group on Modelling. But ultimately, lifting restrictions relies on knowing who has been infected.This might mean mass antibody testing, and even the issuing of immunity certificates' already used in Germany. No reliable antibody tests are yet available, however: the Government said it wants to buy 17.5million subject to them working'.But the most likely approach was outlined by Prof Ferguson yesterday. He said there was a great deal of work under way' looking at how we could substitute some social distancing measures for less intensive' measures by the end of May, which would involving swab-testing any new cases that emerge, and rigorously tracing and testing their contacts in a bid to isolate any remaining virus'He added: The critical thing first is to get case numbers down, and then I'm hopeful in a few weeks we'll be able to move to a regime which will not be normal life - let me emphasise that - but will be somewhat more relaxed in terms of social distancing and the economy but rely more on testing.'Swab testing - currently at 12,000 a day - should be scaled up to 50,000 a day to achieve that, and technology such as mobile phone apps could be used to track people's contacts should they become infected.It is not clear which approach the Government will take - Prof Ferguson says it will be driven by the data'. And it remains to be seen whether any country can truly claim to have got it right.As Anders Tegnell, Sweden's state epidemiologist, told BBC Newsnight last week: I don't think anyone can be seriously confident of getting this right, since it's never happened before.Who will get it right? I'm not quite sure we will ever know, because it looks more and more like most countries will go through the same thing independently of the measures they are taking.'Any relaxation will be staged:cafe tables will be 15ft apart, gatherings will be limited to 20 people, schools will stay closed, football will be played behind closed doors…© Mail On Sunday",'herd_immunity,,"(90, ""'herd_immunity would continue to build during the periods when lockdowns were relaxed, so the infection rate would slow and there would be increasingly lengthy periods between the restrictions."")",251
401,401,"How did Britain get its coronavirus response so wrong?;As the warnings grew louder, Boris Johnson's government was distracted by Brexit. On testing, contact tracing and equipment supply, there was a failure to prepare Coronavirus - latest updatesSee all our coronavirus coverage","April 19, 2020 Sunday","By late December last year, doctors in the central Chinese city of Wuhanwere starting to worry about patients quarantined in their hospitals suffering from an unusual type of pneumonia.As the mystery illness spread in one of China's major industrial hubs, some tried to warn their colleagues to take extra care at work, because the disease resembled Sars (severe acute respiratory syndrome), the deadly respiratory disease that had killed hundreds of people across the region in 2002-03after a government cover-up.One of those who tried to raise the alarm, though only among a few medical school classmates, was a 33-year-old Chinese ophthalmologist, Li Wenliang. Seven people were in isolation at his hospital, he said, and the disease appeared to be a coronavirus, from the same family as Sars.In early January he was called in by police, reprimanded for ""spreading rumours online"", and forced to sign a paper acknowledging his ""misdemeanour"" and promising not to repeat it.Many early cases were linked to the city's Huanan seafood and fresh produce market, which also sold wildlife, suggesting that the first cases were contracted there.Scientists would discover the disease had probably originated in bats and had then passed through a second species - in all likelihood, but not certainly, pangolins, a type of scaly anteater - before infecting humans.But the infections were soon spreading directly between patients, so fast that on 23 January the government announced an unprecedented lockdown of Wuhan city and the surrounding Hubei province.Two weeks later, on 7 February, Li, who had contracted coronavirus himself, died in hospital from the condition about which he had tried to raise the alarm. He had no known underlying conditions and left behind a wife and young child.Li became the face of the mysterious new disease. The story of his death and pictures of him in a hospital bed wearing an oxygen mask made media headlines across the globe, including in the UK.The world, it seemed, was slowly becoming more aware of how lethal coronavirus could be, that it was not just another form of fluwith fairly mild symptoms.But while UK scientists and medical researchers were becoming more concerned, and studying the evidence from China, those among them who were most worried were not getting their messages through to high places.                     Distracted by Brexit and reshuffles                   The Conservative government of Boris Johnson had other more immediate preoccupations at the start of this year.Johnson was still basking in his general election success last December. After he returned from a celebratory Caribbean holiday with his fiancee, Carrie Symonds, the political weather for the prime minister seemed to be set fair. It was honeymoon time.Three and a half years on from the Brexit referendum, the UK was finally about to leave the EU on 31 January. The fireworks and parties for the big night were being planned, the celebratory 50p coins minted.Minds were certainly not on a developing health emergency far away, as Johnson prepared to exploit the moment of the UK's departure from the European Union for all it was worth. ""I think there was some over-confidence,"" admitted one very senior Tory last week.The prime minister and his chief adviser, Dominic Cummings, wanted to make an early impression at home in other ways too, as domestic reformers. Cummings was waging a war on civil servants in Whitehall, throwing his weight around and deliberately upsetting the Westminster applecart.While he made the headlines, briefing about his iconoclastic ambitions, Johnson was preparing a big Cabinet reshuffle to assert his own authority in other areas now Brexit was done and dusted.With Labour effectively leaderless after its fourth consecutive election defeat, there was little opposition to trouble Johnson on any front at all - and certainly no-one of note asking tough questions about coronavirus.The prime minister duly recast his cabinet team on 13 February - five days after Li's death in Wuhan. He made big changes but unsurprisingly retained the hitherto safe pair of hands of Matt Hancock as his health secretary.In a sign of where priorities lay - and the lack of concern that a potential crisis might be heading our way from the east - Hancock wasted no time recording a video of himself grinning with delight on reshuffle day.He smacked his right fist into his left palm saying he could not wait to ""get cracking"" and that he relished the chance to deliver the Tories' manifesto promises, reform social care and improve life sciences. And lastly, in a more sombre voice, he spoke of ""dealing with coronavirus and keeping the public safe"" before adding, as the grin returned: ""Now let's get back to work!""It is perhaps too early to conclude for sure that Johnson, Hancock and the government's entire team of scientific and medical advisers were caught asleep at the wheel. But the fact that Johnson and Hancock themselves, in common with much of the Downing Street staff, would go on to contract the virus or suffer symptoms, further suggests that people at the top had not been sufficiently on their guard.Now, 11 weeks on from the first cases being confirmed in the UK on 31 January - a period during which more than 14,000 people (and probably several thousands more once care home fatalities are counted) in the UK have died from Covid-19 - and with the country in lockdown, the economy facing prolonged recession as a result, schools closed, and no sign of an end in sight - hard questions have to be asked.We already know with some certainty that other countries, such as Germany, South Korea, Taiwan and New Zealand, will emerge from this crisis having performed far better than the UK. A few weeks ago the government's advisers crassly said that fewer than 20,000 deaths would be ""a very good result"" for the UK.As we fast approach that grim tally, many experts now believe the UK may come out of this crisis, whenever that may be, with one of the worst records on fighting coronavirus of any European nation. Once the full tally is counted, few expect the number of deaths to be below 20,000.By contrast, on Friday, Germany was saying it thought it had brought coronavirus largely under control. It had had 3,868 deaths, less a third of the total in the UK (and Germany's population, at 83 million, is far higher), having conducted widespread testing for Covid-19 from early on, precisely as the UK has failed to do.How, then, did it come to this? How did coronavirus spread across the globe, prompting different responses in different countries? Did the UK simply fail to heed the warnings? Or did it just decide to take different decisions, while others settled on alternative actions to save lives?                     The warnings grow louder                   David Nabarro, professor of global health at Imperial College, London, and an envoy for the World Health Organization on Covid-19, says one thing is for sure. All governments were warned how serious the situation was likely to become as early as the end of January. Ignorance of the danger that was coming can be no excuse. Yet it would not be until late March - later than many other countries - that Johnson would announce a complete lockdown.""WHO had been following the outbreak since the end of December and within a few weeks it called a meeting of its emergency committee to decide if this outbreak was a 'public health emergency of international concern',"" said Nabarro.""That is the highest level of alert that WHO can issue, and it issued it on January 30. It made it very clear then - to every country in the world - that we were facing something very serious indeed.""Well before the end of January, the WHO had been tracking the growing threat minutely: 14 January was a key day in the spread of the disease that would become known as Covid-19. The first case was confirmed outside China, with a woman hospitalised in Thailand.A WHO official warned then that it was possible that human-to-human transmission had occurred in families of victims - a sign that the disease had potential to spread far and fast - and, inside China, officials were quietly            told to prepare for a pandemic.There was little international attention on the day, though, because Beijing's dire warnings about a pandemic were made in secret, and a WHO spokesman rowed back from his colleague's claim.Officially, China had not seen a new case of the coronavirus for over a week; the outbreak appeared to be fading. It took another six days for China to publicly acknowledge the gravity of the threat, time that scientists believed meant a further 3,000 people were infected.But on 20 January, officials announced more than 100 new cases and admitted the virus was spreading between humans, a red flag for concern to anyone who works on infectious diseases. The virus could no longer be contained by finding the animal source of the infection and destroying it.Two days later, the scale of the challenge was made clear to the general public when Beijing locked down millions of people. All transport into and out of the metropolis of Wuhan was cut off, an unprecedented modern quarantine that would come at huge human and economic cost.On 29 January, the UK would have its first two confirmed cases of the disease. There was little sense that China's dilemma and its approach - shut down life as we know it or watch the death toll spiral out of control - might have to be our nightmare within weeks.In early February, Donald Trump announced a ban on travellers who had passed through China in the previous 14 days. Europe began focused testing of people with symptoms and travel histories that linked them to the disease, but little else.Johnson, it seemed, still had Brexit and free trade much more on his mind. Any hint of draconian action to fight coronavirus that might hurt the economy was the last thing he was entertaining.In a speech on Brexit in Greenwich on 3 February, he made clear his views on Wuhan-style lockdowns. ""We are starting to hear some bizarre autarkic rhetoric,"" he said, ""when barriers are going up, and when there is a risk that new diseases such as coronavirus will trigger a panic and a desire for market segregation that go beyond what is medically rational to the point of doing real and unnecessary economic damage.""Then, at that moment, humanity needs some government somewhere that is willing at least to make the case powerfully for freedom of exchange, some country ready to take off its Clark Kent spectacles and leap into the phone booth and emerge with its cloak flowing as the supercharged champion of the right of the populations of the Earth to buy and sell freely among each other.""                     'Herd immunity': UK goes it alone                   By early March it was abundantly clear to many academics and scientists that the approach being adopted by the UK was markedly different from those followed by other countries. From South Korea to Germany, governments had invested heavily in expanding testing capacity from the first weeks of the epidemic.Hong Kong, Taiwan and Singapore had brought in controls on travellers from infected regions and strict contact tracing to help understand who could have been exposed, inform them and require self isolation. Face masks became widespread in east Asia, long before it was recommended elsewhere.Testing and contact tracing has been at the heart of the approach advocated by the WHO, so that countries can establish how transmission chains were occurring, in order to break them.Many also brought in some social distancing measures, banning large gatherings, closing schools or extending holidays, and encouraged those who could do to work from home. None were as extreme as China's shutdown, or the European and American lockdowns that would follow.Writing in the Observer last month, Devi Sridhar, chair of global public health at the University of Ediburgh, noted the distinct UK approach. ""Rather than learning from other countries and following the WHO advice, which comes from experts with decades of experience in tackling outbreaks across the world, the UK has decided to follow its own path. This seems to accept that the virus is unstoppable and will probably become an annual, seasonal infection.""The plan, as explained by the chief science adviser, is to work towards 'herd immunity', which is to have the majority of the population contract the virus, develop antibodies and then become immune to it. This theory has been widely used to advocate for mass vaccination for measles, mumps and rubella. The thinking is that, if most of the population is vaccinated, a small percentage can go unvaccinated without cases emerging.""It was not just the UK whose politicians and scientific advisers were, arguably, slow to act in the early stages. Others countries, including Spain and France, were caught out too, but it was Italy's tragedy that alerted Europe to the scale of the threat it faced.European governments and citizens were forced to reckon with the reality that in an age of global travel, the thousands of miles separating them from China meant almost nothing at all. Thousands of Britons were holidaying in Italy the week that it shut down. They were advised to go into self-quarantine on return, but were not registered by the health authorities, nor were their contacts tracked.Italy and the UK had both had had their first case a day apart at the end of January, but cases rose faster in Italy. The country may just have been unlucky that carriers of the disease flew to its northern cities and ski resorts rather than to other European capitals.Whatever the reason, cases and then deaths started climbing sharply in northern Italy in late February. Dozens of towns were locked down from the 21st, but in the rest of the country life carried on as normal.It was soon clear that the problem had not been contained. On 8 March, the prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, quarantined 16 million people across the north of the country, and the next day extended the lockdown to all of Italy.The measures saved lives, but came too late for thousands of Italians. The death toll outstripped China, and the world looked on horrified as hospitals were overwhelmed, doctors forced to choose who should have a chance on a ventilator and who should die. On 11 March, the WHO declared a global pandemic. On 14 March, Spain went into lockdown, and three days later France did the same.But in the UK there appeared to be greater reluctance to act decisively with lockdowns: the banning of mass gatherings and the closure of pubs and restaurants. The government's scientific and behavioural science advisers were warning ministers that the public might react badly to draconian measures and would not tolerate them for long.In an apparent show of defiance against the lockdowners, Johnson and Symonds attended the England v Wales rugby match at Twickenham on 7 March. The Cheltenham Festival, attended over three days to 13 March by 250,000 racegoers, was allowed to go ahead.                     Shutdown: Johnson changes tack                   The tone was about to change. In a Downing Street press conference on 12 March, Johnson, who had said a few days before the first UK death that the disease was ""likely to spread a bit more"" suddenly became the deliverer of grave warnings.Previous talk by his advisers of avoiding lockdowns and developing ""herd immunity"" had been banished and replaced by a brutal honesty. ""I must level with you,"" Johnson told reporters. ""More families, many more families, are going to lose loved ones before their time."" On 18 March - just days after Downing Street had suggested it was not on the cards - the government announced the closure of all schools until further noticed. Pubs and restaurants were ordered to shut on 20 March. The UK had come late into line.One former cabinet minister last week described the change of approach as a ""screeching U-turn"". Johnson and his ministers were now, even more than before, taking cover behind, and advice from, their scientific and medical advisers. Many of these advisers had become increasingly concerned that the UK had become out of step with other countries because of political resistance from ministers to measures that would hit the economy. The Observer has been told that at least two senior government advisers were on the brink of of quitting before Johnson switched his approach.The government has found itself unable to escape the consequences of a wider failure to prepare. As hospitals threatened to be overwhelmed before orders were given to massively expand capacity, ministers came under intense criticism over the lack of protective equipment for frontline NHS staff, over the lack of ventilators for patients in intensive care, and for a failure to test more widely for Covid-19, particularly among NHS workers.The lack of preparedness and instances of chaotic planning has shocked many in and outside the NHS.Last week, Dr Alison Pittard, the dean of the Faculty of Intensive Care Medicine, the professional body for intensive care practitioners, said the minimum specifications for the government's own homegrown ventilator scheme would produce machines that would only treat patients ""for a few hours"". ""If we had been told that that was the case... we'd have said: 'Don't bother, you're wasting your time. That's of no use',"" she told the Financial Times.Last month the government missed an EU procurement deadline for ventilators because, minister said, an email went unnoticed. The NHS had said 30,000 more would be needed, Hancock reduced this to 18,000. Pittard said her faculty had been warning for years about a shortage of intensive care capacity and intensive care nurses in hospitals.Normally each intensive care patient would have one intensive care nurse in attendance all the time, she said. Now there was one nurse to six patients, although other staff had been redeployed to intensive care units to plug the gaps and the new system was working because of heroic efforts. Although she was reluctant to criticise the government, she said that if the faculty had been listened to, ""we wouldn't be starting from this place"". Germany, she pointed out, has 29 intensive care beds per 100,000 people, compared with six in the UK.The Tory MP and former health minister Dan Poulter, who works part-time in the NHS, said that given the enormity of the challenge facing government ""it almost seems wrong to be critical"".But he believes part of the problem is that insufficient advice has been sought from experienced NHS clinicians who would have warned of problems with PPE early on, of the shortage of ventilators and would have told ministers of the urgent need to test NHS staff.""An early over-reliance on academic modelling also resulted in a lack of experienced frontline NHS clinicians - in other words, the people who really understand the day-to-day challenges our hospitals and health service face - from feeding into the initial Covid-19 action plan,"" he said. ""This has manifested itself amongst other things in the slowness of providing adequate PPE for frontline NHS staff and in the lack of virus testing for healthcare staff in the earlier part of the outbreak.""                     How the scientists reacted                   When the investigations into the UK's response to Covid-19 come to be written, there is widespread recognition among experts that this lack of long-term strategic planning will be at the centre of it. So too should be the need to ensure that the views of experts are fed into government more efficiently and widely. The prospect of a previously unknown disease spreading catastrophically around the globe and infecting millions is, after all, not a new one.Indeed, many warnings have been given in the past about the viral dangers facing humanity. ""Given the continual emergence of new pathogens ... and the ever-increasing connectedness of our world, there is a significant probability that a large and lethal pandemic will occur in our lifetime,"" Bill Gates predicted several years ago. ""And it will have the impact of a nuclear war,"" he warned, while urging nations to start stockpiling antiviral drugs and therapies. If only.For its part, the WHO prepared - several years ago - a list of viruses with no known treatments or vaccines, illnesses that could one day trigger that pandemic and kill hundreds of thousands. Prospective killers included nipah disease and lassa fever as well as an ailment it simply called ""disease X"" - ""a serious international epidemic caused by a pathogen currently unknown"".As to the most likely nature of that mysterious virus, most modelling assumed that disease X would be flu-like in behaviour, says Dr Josie Golding, the epidemics lead at the Wellcome Trust. After all, influenza had caused so many deadly global outbreaks in the past. As a result, a lot of investment went into making influenza vaccines in preparation, she says. ""But have we been thinking about diseases other than influenza that might become pandemics? I don't think we have. There has been a real gap in our thinking.""Then came the appearance of Covid-19 - caused not by a strain of influenza but by a coronavirus - in November. Initially, only a few cases were highlighted, a trend that began to change early this year with a rise in numbers of infected ill people.""The report that really grabbed my attention came out in mid-January,"" says epidemiologist Professor Mark Woolhouse at Edinburgh University. ""It said 41 cases of this new respiratory illness had now been diagnosed in one small area of China, around Wuhan. And that set the alarm bells ringing for me.""For Woolhouse, the cluster of cases in one place showed this was not a matter of a few people scattered around China picking up an occasional infection from an animal such as a bat or a chicken. ""Forty-one cases in one small area at the same time could not be explained that way. People are not picking this up from animals, I realised. They are actually spreading it to each other. It was already heading out of control.""Ewan Birney, head of the Cambridgeshire-based European Bioinformatics Institute, part of the European Molecular Biology Laboratory network, also noted the significance of the new disease at the time. ""I presumed, at first, that this one would also burn itself out, probably somewhere in Asia,"" he says.His reasoning was straightforward. The outbreak of Sars that appeared in 2003 in China was caused by a coronavirus and killed more than 10% of those it infected. ""In fact, it killed or hospitalised so many of those it infected the chain of transmission from one person to others was cut. It was too lethal for its own good. So I thought this might happen with this new disease. But it turns out Covid-19 is much milder and incapacitates fewer individuals, so there is no cut in its transmission. When that became apparent - around mid-January - I became very worried.""Then there was the infectiousness of the new virus. A person with Sars generally starts to display symptoms before they infect other people. That makes it much easier to contain. But this was not the case with Covid-19. Early data from China - again released in January - showed the virus was being spread from people who were displaying only the mildest symptoms, or in some cases no symptoms. This was making the condition very difficult to track, says virologist Professor Jonathan Ball of Nottingham University.""At that point I realised this outbreak was going to be very serious,"" he added. ""I sent a tweet to a colleague in Australia. It simply said: 'This one is out of the bag properly'. He sent one back agreeing with me.""Around this time, Paul Nurse, Nobel laureate and head of the Francis Crick Institute, recalls attending a conference where he met Mark Walport, head of UK Research and Innovation, the organisation that funds a vast slice of British scientific research.""He had just received a text message from a colleague about the outbreak and we started to discuss the implications,"" Nurse recalls. ""It did not take us long for us both to realise this was going to be very significant. It took another two or three weeks to confirm these worst fears - by mid-February.""By this time, Birney had realised the virus had a real sting in its tail and could cause serious illness among the elderly and those with other underlying serious ailments. ""It was half-term and I was on holiday with my parents. All I wanted to do was to get the holiday over and then get them back to their house in the country where they could keep themselves isolated.""In February, sporadic cases of Covid-19 were appearing round the country, recalls Tom Wingfield, a clinician and infectious disease expert based at the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine. ""These were cases that had been brought into the country, mainly from China or Italy. Then there was an outbreak in Brighton [and a number of other cases without foreign travel] and I realised that the virus had established itself in a community there. It was a turning point.""Britain was still doing quite well in containing the disease by testing, tracing contact and setting up quarantine for those suspected of being infected with Covid-19 at this time. ""Then, in March, the government decided to abandon this approach and shift from containing the disease to delaying its progress,"" says Wingfield. ""I would really like to know why the decision to give up testing and contact tracing was taken.""Many other researchers also question why the government took so long to react to their warnings. ""Part of the trouble was there were other virologists who were saying this was going to be like Sars or flu and there was not too much to worry about,"" says Ball. ""But Sars happened in 2003. The world is much more connected now than it was then. More to the point, Covid-19 was also much more infectious than Sars. And so it started appearing in lots of other countries.""Perhaps some of us should have got up in front of BBC News and said you lot ought to be petrified because this is going to be a pandemic that will kill hundreds of thousands of people,"" adds Ball. ""None of us thought this was a particularly constructive thing to do, but maybe with hindsight we should have. If there had been more voices, maybe politicians would have taken this a bit more seriously.""""There is no question that we were insufficiently prepared,"" Nurse says. ""We had been warned a few years ago when reports made it clear that the UK was not ready to combat a major flu pandemic and we did not take up that warning. As a result, we were caught out.""He and many others say an inquiry into Britain's Covid-19 preparedness will have to be held at some point but stress that this should not be started until the crisis has been dealt with in the UK.Professor Ian Boyd, a former chief scientific adviser at the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, agrees. ""There is a great danger there will be a lot of looking back with the benefits of hindsight and poking fingers of blame,"" warns Boyd. ""But when you are in the middle of things you have to make a lot of very hard 50-50 decisions, and sometimes you make the wrong call. On the other hand, there is no harm in making sure that we learn as many lessons as we can.""                     The lessons from the rest of the world ...                   Boris Johnson, after his own brush with death at the hands of Covid-19, will presumably no longer take the gung-ho attitude to illness that he has always has. A former Tory minister said: ""If Boris had any sense he would take control of the inquiry and lead it.""One conclusion that experts are already drawing is that it was those countries close to China, with memories of Sars, or cultural ties to their neighbour, which were much faster to act in response to Covid-19. Perhaps most notable in its success was Taiwan. Closely linked by economic and cultural ties to mainland China, Taiwan could have been at high risk of a major Covid-19 epidemic. Tourists and business people travelled regularly back and forth.But helped perhaps by having an epidemiologist as vice-president, the government set up a gold standard regime of testing and contact tracing that means that nearly three months on from its first confirmed infection, it has registered fewer than 400 cases and six deaths.Taiwan's extensive testing and thorough contact tracing are precisely the kind of action that the former health secretary Jeremy Hunt is demanding before the UK lockdown is lifted. Hunt points out that it is one of the essential conditions set by the WHO to avoid a second wave resulting from an easing of restrictions.Hong Kong, which also suffered from the Sars crisis, also moved early to enforce quarantine and social distancing, as well as widespread mask wearing, and today has registered just over 1,000 cases and only four deaths.In late February, South Korea looked like it was on a trajectory to disaster, with the highest number of confirmed cases outside China, and numbers rising rapidly. But after the country's first infection, the government met medical companies and urged them to start developing coronavirus test kits on a massive scale.The results were impressive. When the epidemic hit, it was ready to deploy largescale testing. Its measures allowed South Korea to become the second country to flatten its coronavirus curve, without the sweeping shutdowns of society and economic activity that China had pioneered and the west would be forced to adopt.China's experience should have provided a grim template for western countries to use to prepare. The speed with which Wuhan's crisis had intensified showed that a relatively advanced medical system could be swamped. Within three weeks there were over 64,000 people infected and 1,000 dead.The pleas for help from Wuhan's residents and doctors were to be echoed by those from Italy a few weeks later, and soon after the UK.Look back three months, and in China there were not enough tests to work out who had coronavirus, there was not enough protective equipment for medical staff treating patients, and then, soon, tragically there were not enough hospital beds and ventilators for sick patients. These are exactly the challenges faced by authorities from New York to Rome, London to Madrid.                     ... and the other country that didn't listen                   If the UK has serious questions to answer, the country that so far has seen the worst of the outbreak, the United States, was slowest of all to act. Trump for months ignored, played down or lied about the threat posed by coronavirus, leaving individual states to act unilaterally as it became clear it had already taken hold on US soil.On 17 March parts of California issued ""shelter in place"" orders, effectively a lockdown. By the end of that week New York City had also shut down, along with a dozen states, and the majority of the rest of the country had put some restrictions in place. Only five states had few or no controls.There have now been nearly 700,000 confirmed cases in the US and over 33,000 deaths; actual numbers are likely to be higher for both. The economy has also been devastated, with more than 22 million out of work as businesses collapse or shrink under the strain.Trump insists the US is turning a corner, and has tried to blame - among other targets - the WHO for failing to fully raise the alarm, and has stripped it of its US funding.There have certainly been questions about the organisation's strong praise for China and the exclusion of Taiwan, which may have contributed to the delay in recognising human-to-human transmission was occurring. But it began daily briefings on 22 January and had declared aglobal health emergency by the end of that month.While initially sceptical about China's distancing measures, it urged other countries to adopt them once there was evidence they were working. It warned about shortages of PPE over a month ago, and since the beginning of the outbreak has urged countries, including the UK, to ""test, test, test"" to contain the virus - a strategy followed by almost all countries that have managed to suppress it.A senior Whitehall source with detailed knowledge of the UK's response and those of other countries said: ""The fact is that those countries who knew a lot about Sars quickly saw the danger. But in the UK the attitude among politicians and also scientists was that it was really just some form of a flu. All the government's pandemic planning was based on a flu scenario. And then it turned out to be something different and far, far worse and the response was completely...",'herd_immunity,,"(68, ""'herd_immunity': uk goes it alone                   by early march it was abundantly clear to many academics and scientists that the approach being adopted by the uk was markedly different from those followed by other countries."")",318
401,401,"How did Britain get its coronavirus response so wrong?;As the warnings grew louder, Boris Johnson's government was distracted by Brexit. On testing, contact tracing and equipment supply, there was a failure to prepare Coronavirus - latest updatesSee all our coronavirus coverage","April 19, 2020 Sunday","By late December last year, doctors in the central Chinese city of Wuhanwere starting to worry about patients quarantined in their hospitals suffering from an unusual type of pneumonia.As the mystery illness spread in one of China's major industrial hubs, some tried to warn their colleagues to take extra care at work, because the disease resembled Sars (severe acute respiratory syndrome), the deadly respiratory disease that had killed hundreds of people across the region in 2002-03after a government cover-up.One of those who tried to raise the alarm, though only among a few medical school classmates, was a 33-year-old Chinese ophthalmologist, Li Wenliang. Seven people were in isolation at his hospital, he said, and the disease appeared to be a coronavirus, from the same family as Sars.In early January he was called in by police, reprimanded for ""spreading rumours online"", and forced to sign a paper acknowledging his ""misdemeanour"" and promising not to repeat it.Many early cases were linked to the city's Huanan seafood and fresh produce market, which also sold wildlife, suggesting that the first cases were contracted there.Scientists would discover the disease had probably originated in bats and had then passed through a second species - in all likelihood, but not certainly, pangolins, a type of scaly anteater - before infecting humans.But the infections were soon spreading directly between patients, so fast that on 23 January the government announced an unprecedented lockdown of Wuhan city and the surrounding Hubei province.Two weeks later, on 7 February, Li, who had contracted coronavirus himself, died in hospital from the condition about which he had tried to raise the alarm. He had no known underlying conditions and left behind a wife and young child.Li became the face of the mysterious new disease. The story of his death and pictures of him in a hospital bed wearing an oxygen mask made media headlines across the globe, including in the UK.The world, it seemed, was slowly becoming more aware of how lethal coronavirus could be, that it was not just another form of fluwith fairly mild symptoms.But while UK scientists and medical researchers were becoming more concerned, and studying the evidence from China, those among them who were most worried were not getting their messages through to high places.                     Distracted by Brexit and reshuffles                   The Conservative government of Boris Johnson had other more immediate preoccupations at the start of this year.Johnson was still basking in his general election success last December. After he returned from a celebratory Caribbean holiday with his fiancee, Carrie Symonds, the political weather for the prime minister seemed to be set fair. It was honeymoon time.Three and a half years on from the Brexit referendum, the UK was finally about to leave the EU on 31 January. The fireworks and parties for the big night were being planned, the celebratory 50p coins minted.Minds were certainly not on a developing health emergency far away, as Johnson prepared to exploit the moment of the UK's departure from the European Union for all it was worth. ""I think there was some over-confidence,"" admitted one very senior Tory last week.The prime minister and his chief adviser, Dominic Cummings, wanted to make an early impression at home in other ways too, as domestic reformers. Cummings was waging a war on civil servants in Whitehall, throwing his weight around and deliberately upsetting the Westminster applecart.While he made the headlines, briefing about his iconoclastic ambitions, Johnson was preparing a big Cabinet reshuffle to assert his own authority in other areas now Brexit was done and dusted.With Labour effectively leaderless after its fourth consecutive election defeat, there was little opposition to trouble Johnson on any front at all - and certainly no-one of note asking tough questions about coronavirus.The prime minister duly recast his cabinet team on 13 February - five days after Li's death in Wuhan. He made big changes but unsurprisingly retained the hitherto safe pair of hands of Matt Hancock as his health secretary.In a sign of where priorities lay - and the lack of concern that a potential crisis might be heading our way from the east - Hancock wasted no time recording a video of himself grinning with delight on reshuffle day.He smacked his right fist into his left palm saying he could not wait to ""get cracking"" and that he relished the chance to deliver the Tories' manifesto promises, reform social care and improve life sciences. And lastly, in a more sombre voice, he spoke of ""dealing with coronavirus and keeping the public safe"" before adding, as the grin returned: ""Now let's get back to work!""It is perhaps too early to conclude for sure that Johnson, Hancock and the government's entire team of scientific and medical advisers were caught asleep at the wheel. But the fact that Johnson and Hancock themselves, in common with much of the Downing Street staff, would go on to contract the virus or suffer symptoms, further suggests that people at the top had not been sufficiently on their guard.Now, 11 weeks on from the first cases being confirmed in the UK on 31 January - a period during which more than 14,000 people (and probably several thousands more once care home fatalities are counted) in the UK have died from Covid-19 - and with the country in lockdown, the economy facing prolonged recession as a result, schools closed, and no sign of an end in sight - hard questions have to be asked.We already know with some certainty that other countries, such as Germany, South Korea, Taiwan and New Zealand, will emerge from this crisis having performed far better than the UK. A few weeks ago the government's advisers crassly said that fewer than 20,000 deaths would be ""a very good result"" for the UK.As we fast approach that grim tally, many experts now believe the UK may come out of this crisis, whenever that may be, with one of the worst records on fighting coronavirus of any European nation. Once the full tally is counted, few expect the number of deaths to be below 20,000.By contrast, on Friday, Germany was saying it thought it had brought coronavirus largely under control. It had had 3,868 deaths, less a third of the total in the UK (and Germany's population, at 83 million, is far higher), having conducted widespread testing for Covid-19 from early on, precisely as the UK has failed to do.How, then, did it come to this? How did coronavirus spread across the globe, prompting different responses in different countries? Did the UK simply fail to heed the warnings? Or did it just decide to take different decisions, while others settled on alternative actions to save lives?                     The warnings grow louder                   David Nabarro, professor of global health at Imperial College, London, and an envoy for the World Health Organization on Covid-19, says one thing is for sure. All governments were warned how serious the situation was likely to become as early as the end of January. Ignorance of the danger that was coming can be no excuse. Yet it would not be until late March - later than many other countries - that Johnson would announce a complete lockdown.""WHO had been following the outbreak since the end of December and within a few weeks it called a meeting of its emergency committee to decide if this outbreak was a 'public health emergency of international concern',"" said Nabarro.""That is the highest level of alert that WHO can issue, and it issued it on January 30. It made it very clear then - to every country in the world - that we were facing something very serious indeed.""Well before the end of January, the WHO had been tracking the growing threat minutely: 14 January was a key day in the spread of the disease that would become known as Covid-19. The first case was confirmed outside China, with a woman hospitalised in Thailand.A WHO official warned then that it was possible that human-to-human transmission had occurred in families of victims - a sign that the disease had potential to spread far and fast - and, inside China, officials were quietly            told to prepare for a pandemic.There was little international attention on the day, though, because Beijing's dire warnings about a pandemic were made in secret, and a WHO spokesman rowed back from his colleague's claim.Officially, China had not seen a new case of the coronavirus for over a week; the outbreak appeared to be fading. It took another six days for China to publicly acknowledge the gravity of the threat, time that scientists believed meant a further 3,000 people were infected.But on 20 January, officials announced more than 100 new cases and admitted the virus was spreading between humans, a red flag for concern to anyone who works on infectious diseases. The virus could no longer be contained by finding the animal source of the infection and destroying it.Two days later, the scale of the challenge was made clear to the general public when Beijing locked down millions of people. All transport into and out of the metropolis of Wuhan was cut off, an unprecedented modern quarantine that would come at huge human and economic cost.On 29 January, the UK would have its first two confirmed cases of the disease. There was little sense that China's dilemma and its approach - shut down life as we know it or watch the death toll spiral out of control - might have to be our nightmare within weeks.In early February, Donald Trump announced a ban on travellers who had passed through China in the previous 14 days. Europe began focused testing of people with symptoms and travel histories that linked them to the disease, but little else.Johnson, it seemed, still had Brexit and free trade much more on his mind. Any hint of draconian action to fight coronavirus that might hurt the economy was the last thing he was entertaining.In a speech on Brexit in Greenwich on 3 February, he made clear his views on Wuhan-style lockdowns. ""We are starting to hear some bizarre autarkic rhetoric,"" he said, ""when barriers are going up, and when there is a risk that new diseases such as coronavirus will trigger a panic and a desire for market segregation that go beyond what is medically rational to the point of doing real and unnecessary economic damage.""Then, at that moment, humanity needs some government somewhere that is willing at least to make the case powerfully for freedom of exchange, some country ready to take off its Clark Kent spectacles and leap into the phone booth and emerge with its cloak flowing as the supercharged champion of the right of the populations of the Earth to buy and sell freely among each other.""                     'Herd immunity': UK goes it alone                   By early March it was abundantly clear to many academics and scientists that the approach being adopted by the UK was markedly different from those followed by other countries. From South Korea to Germany, governments had invested heavily in expanding testing capacity from the first weeks of the epidemic.Hong Kong, Taiwan and Singapore had brought in controls on travellers from infected regions and strict contact tracing to help understand who could have been exposed, inform them and require self isolation. Face masks became widespread in east Asia, long before it was recommended elsewhere.Testing and contact tracing has been at the heart of the approach advocated by the WHO, so that countries can establish how transmission chains were occurring, in order to break them.Many also brought in some social distancing measures, banning large gatherings, closing schools or extending holidays, and encouraged those who could do to work from home. None were as extreme as China's shutdown, or the European and American lockdowns that would follow.Writing in the Observer last month, Devi Sridhar, chair of global public health at the University of Ediburgh, noted the distinct UK approach. ""Rather than learning from other countries and following the WHO advice, which comes from experts with decades of experience in tackling outbreaks across the world, the UK has decided to follow its own path. This seems to accept that the virus is unstoppable and will probably become an annual, seasonal infection.""The plan, as explained by the chief science adviser, is to work towards 'herd immunity', which is to have the majority of the population contract the virus, develop antibodies and then become immune to it. This theory has been widely used to advocate for mass vaccination for measles, mumps and rubella. The thinking is that, if most of the population is vaccinated, a small percentage can go unvaccinated without cases emerging.""It was not just the UK whose politicians and scientific advisers were, arguably, slow to act in the early stages. Others countries, including Spain and France, were caught out too, but it was Italy's tragedy that alerted Europe to the scale of the threat it faced.European governments and citizens were forced to reckon with the reality that in an age of global travel, the thousands of miles separating them from China meant almost nothing at all. Thousands of Britons were holidaying in Italy the week that it shut down. They were advised to go into self-quarantine on return, but were not registered by the health authorities, nor were their contacts tracked.Italy and the UK had both had had their first case a day apart at the end of January, but cases rose faster in Italy. The country may just have been unlucky that carriers of the disease flew to its northern cities and ski resorts rather than to other European capitals.Whatever the reason, cases and then deaths started climbing sharply in northern Italy in late February. Dozens of towns were locked down from the 21st, but in the rest of the country life carried on as normal.It was soon clear that the problem had not been contained. On 8 March, the prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, quarantined 16 million people across the north of the country, and the next day extended the lockdown to all of Italy.The measures saved lives, but came too late for thousands of Italians. The death toll outstripped China, and the world looked on horrified as hospitals were overwhelmed, doctors forced to choose who should have a chance on a ventilator and who should die. On 11 March, the WHO declared a global pandemic. On 14 March, Spain went into lockdown, and three days later France did the same.But in the UK there appeared to be greater reluctance to act decisively with lockdowns: the banning of mass gatherings and the closure of pubs and restaurants. The government's scientific and behavioural science advisers were warning ministers that the public might react badly to draconian measures and would not tolerate them for long.In an apparent show of defiance against the lockdowners, Johnson and Symonds attended the England v Wales rugby match at Twickenham on 7 March. The Cheltenham Festival, attended over three days to 13 March by 250,000 racegoers, was allowed to go ahead.                     Shutdown: Johnson changes tack                   The tone was about to change. In a Downing Street press conference on 12 March, Johnson, who had said a few days before the first UK death that the disease was ""likely to spread a bit more"" suddenly became the deliverer of grave warnings.Previous talk by his advisers of avoiding lockdowns and developing ""herd immunity"" had been banished and replaced by a brutal honesty. ""I must level with you,"" Johnson told reporters. ""More families, many more families, are going to lose loved ones before their time."" On 18 March - just days after Downing Street had suggested it was not on the cards - the government announced the closure of all schools until further noticed. Pubs and restaurants were ordered to shut on 20 March. The UK had come late into line.One former cabinet minister last week described the change of approach as a ""screeching U-turn"". Johnson and his ministers were now, even more than before, taking cover behind, and advice from, their scientific and medical advisers. Many of these advisers had become increasingly concerned that the UK had become out of step with other countries because of political resistance from ministers to measures that would hit the economy. The Observer has been told that at least two senior government advisers were on the brink of of quitting before Johnson switched his approach.The government has found itself unable to escape the consequences of a wider failure to prepare. As hospitals threatened to be overwhelmed before orders were given to massively expand capacity, ministers came under intense criticism over the lack of protective equipment for frontline NHS staff, over the lack of ventilators for patients in intensive care, and for a failure to test more widely for Covid-19, particularly among NHS workers.The lack of preparedness and instances of chaotic planning has shocked many in and outside the NHS.Last week, Dr Alison Pittard, the dean of the Faculty of Intensive Care Medicine, the professional body for intensive care practitioners, said the minimum specifications for the government's own homegrown ventilator scheme would produce machines that would only treat patients ""for a few hours"". ""If we had been told that that was the case... we'd have said: 'Don't bother, you're wasting your time. That's of no use',"" she told the Financial Times.Last month the government missed an EU procurement deadline for ventilators because, minister said, an email went unnoticed. The NHS had said 30,000 more would be needed, Hancock reduced this to 18,000. Pittard said her faculty had been warning for years about a shortage of intensive care capacity and intensive care nurses in hospitals.Normally each intensive care patient would have one intensive care nurse in attendance all the time, she said. Now there was one nurse to six patients, although other staff had been redeployed to intensive care units to plug the gaps and the new system was working because of heroic efforts. Although she was reluctant to criticise the government, she said that if the faculty had been listened to, ""we wouldn't be starting from this place"". Germany, she pointed out, has 29 intensive care beds per 100,000 people, compared with six in the UK.The Tory MP and former health minister Dan Poulter, who works part-time in the NHS, said that given the enormity of the challenge facing government ""it almost seems wrong to be critical"".But he believes part of the problem is that insufficient advice has been sought from experienced NHS clinicians who would have warned of problems with PPE early on, of the shortage of ventilators and would have told ministers of the urgent need to test NHS staff.""An early over-reliance on academic modelling also resulted in a lack of experienced frontline NHS clinicians - in other words, the people who really understand the day-to-day challenges our hospitals and health service face - from feeding into the initial Covid-19 action plan,"" he said. ""This has manifested itself amongst other things in the slowness of providing adequate PPE for frontline NHS staff and in the lack of virus testing for healthcare staff in the earlier part of the outbreak.""                     How the scientists reacted                   When the investigations into the UK's response to Covid-19 come to be written, there is widespread recognition among experts that this lack of long-term strategic planning will be at the centre of it. So too should be the need to ensure that the views of experts are fed into government more efficiently and widely. The prospect of a previously unknown disease spreading catastrophically around the globe and infecting millions is, after all, not a new one.Indeed, many warnings have been given in the past about the viral dangers facing humanity. ""Given the continual emergence of new pathogens ... and the ever-increasing connectedness of our world, there is a significant probability that a large and lethal pandemic will occur in our lifetime,"" Bill Gates predicted several years ago. ""And it will have the impact of a nuclear war,"" he warned, while urging nations to start stockpiling antiviral drugs and therapies. If only.For its part, the WHO prepared - several years ago - a list of viruses with no known treatments or vaccines, illnesses that could one day trigger that pandemic and kill hundreds of thousands. Prospective killers included nipah disease and lassa fever as well as an ailment it simply called ""disease X"" - ""a serious international epidemic caused by a pathogen currently unknown"".As to the most likely nature of that mysterious virus, most modelling assumed that disease X would be flu-like in behaviour, says Dr Josie Golding, the epidemics lead at the Wellcome Trust. After all, influenza had caused so many deadly global outbreaks in the past. As a result, a lot of investment went into making influenza vaccines in preparation, she says. ""But have we been thinking about diseases other than influenza that might become pandemics? I don't think we have. There has been a real gap in our thinking.""Then came the appearance of Covid-19 - caused not by a strain of influenza but by a coronavirus - in November. Initially, only a few cases were highlighted, a trend that began to change early this year with a rise in numbers of infected ill people.""The report that really grabbed my attention came out in mid-January,"" says epidemiologist Professor Mark Woolhouse at Edinburgh University. ""It said 41 cases of this new respiratory illness had now been diagnosed in one small area of China, around Wuhan. And that set the alarm bells ringing for me.""For Woolhouse, the cluster of cases in one place showed this was not a matter of a few people scattered around China picking up an occasional infection from an animal such as a bat or a chicken. ""Forty-one cases in one small area at the same time could not be explained that way. People are not picking this up from animals, I realised. They are actually spreading it to each other. It was already heading out of control.""Ewan Birney, head of the Cambridgeshire-based European Bioinformatics Institute, part of the European Molecular Biology Laboratory network, also noted the significance of the new disease at the time. ""I presumed, at first, that this one would also burn itself out, probably somewhere in Asia,"" he says.His reasoning was straightforward. The outbreak of Sars that appeared in 2003 in China was caused by a coronavirus and killed more than 10% of those it infected. ""In fact, it killed or hospitalised so many of those it infected the chain of transmission from one person to others was cut. It was too lethal for its own good. So I thought this might happen with this new disease. But it turns out Covid-19 is much milder and incapacitates fewer individuals, so there is no cut in its transmission. When that became apparent - around mid-January - I became very worried.""Then there was the infectiousness of the new virus. A person with Sars generally starts to display symptoms before they infect other people. That makes it much easier to contain. But this was not the case with Covid-19. Early data from China - again released in January - showed the virus was being spread from people who were displaying only the mildest symptoms, or in some cases no symptoms. This was making the condition very difficult to track, says virologist Professor Jonathan Ball of Nottingham University.""At that point I realised this outbreak was going to be very serious,"" he added. ""I sent a tweet to a colleague in Australia. It simply said: 'This one is out of the bag properly'. He sent one back agreeing with me.""Around this time, Paul Nurse, Nobel laureate and head of the Francis Crick Institute, recalls attending a conference where he met Mark Walport, head of UK Research and Innovation, the organisation that funds a vast slice of British scientific research.""He had just received a text message from a colleague about the outbreak and we started to discuss the implications,"" Nurse recalls. ""It did not take us long for us both to realise this was going to be very significant. It took another two or three weeks to confirm these worst fears - by mid-February.""By this time, Birney had realised the virus had a real sting in its tail and could cause serious illness among the elderly and those with other underlying serious ailments. ""It was half-term and I was on holiday with my parents. All I wanted to do was to get the holiday over and then get them back to their house in the country where they could keep themselves isolated.""In February, sporadic cases of Covid-19 were appearing round the country, recalls Tom Wingfield, a clinician and infectious disease expert based at the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine. ""These were cases that had been brought into the country, mainly from China or Italy. Then there was an outbreak in Brighton [and a number of other cases without foreign travel] and I realised that the virus had established itself in a community there. It was a turning point.""Britain was still doing quite well in containing the disease by testing, tracing contact and setting up quarantine for those suspected of being infected with Covid-19 at this time. ""Then, in March, the government decided to abandon this approach and shift from containing the disease to delaying its progress,"" says Wingfield. ""I would really like to know why the decision to give up testing and contact tracing was taken.""Many other researchers also question why the government took so long to react to their warnings. ""Part of the trouble was there were other virologists who were saying this was going to be like Sars or flu and there was not too much to worry about,"" says Ball. ""But Sars happened in 2003. The world is much more connected now than it was then. More to the point, Covid-19 was also much more infectious than Sars. And so it started appearing in lots of other countries.""Perhaps some of us should have got up in front of BBC News and said you lot ought to be petrified because this is going to be a pandemic that will kill hundreds of thousands of people,"" adds Ball. ""None of us thought this was a particularly constructive thing to do, but maybe with hindsight we should have. If there had been more voices, maybe politicians would have taken this a bit more seriously.""""There is no question that we were insufficiently prepared,"" Nurse says. ""We had been warned a few years ago when reports made it clear that the UK was not ready to combat a major flu pandemic and we did not take up that warning. As a result, we were caught out.""He and many others say an inquiry into Britain's Covid-19 preparedness will have to be held at some point but stress that this should not be started until the crisis has been dealt with in the UK.Professor Ian Boyd, a former chief scientific adviser at the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, agrees. ""There is a great danger there will be a lot of looking back with the benefits of hindsight and poking fingers of blame,"" warns Boyd. ""But when you are in the middle of things you have to make a lot of very hard 50-50 decisions, and sometimes you make the wrong call. On the other hand, there is no harm in making sure that we learn as many lessons as we can.""                     The lessons from the rest of the world ...                   Boris Johnson, after his own brush with death at the hands of Covid-19, will presumably no longer take the gung-ho attitude to illness that he has always has. A former Tory minister said: ""If Boris had any sense he would take control of the inquiry and lead it.""One conclusion that experts are already drawing is that it was those countries close to China, with memories of Sars, or cultural ties to their neighbour, which were much faster to act in response to Covid-19. Perhaps most notable in its success was Taiwan. Closely linked by economic and cultural ties to mainland China, Taiwan could have been at high risk of a major Covid-19 epidemic. Tourists and business people travelled regularly back and forth.But helped perhaps by having an epidemiologist as vice-president, the government set up a gold standard regime of testing and contact tracing that means that nearly three months on from its first confirmed infection, it has registered fewer than 400 cases and six deaths.Taiwan's extensive testing and thorough contact tracing are precisely the kind of action that the former health secretary Jeremy Hunt is demanding before the UK lockdown is lifted. Hunt points out that it is one of the essential conditions set by the WHO to avoid a second wave resulting from an easing of restrictions.Hong Kong, which also suffered from the Sars crisis, also moved early to enforce quarantine and social distancing, as well as widespread mask wearing, and today has registered just over 1,000 cases and only four deaths.In late February, South Korea looked like it was on a trajectory to disaster, with the highest number of confirmed cases outside China, and numbers rising rapidly. But after the country's first infection, the government met medical companies and urged them to start developing coronavirus test kits on a massive scale.The results were impressive. When the epidemic hit, it was ready to deploy largescale testing. Its measures allowed South Korea to become the second country to flatten its coronavirus curve, without the sweeping shutdowns of society and economic activity that China had pioneered and the west would be forced to adopt.China's experience should have provided a grim template for western countries to use to prepare. The speed with which Wuhan's crisis had intensified showed that a relatively advanced medical system could be swamped. Within three weeks there were over 64,000 people infected and 1,000 dead.The pleas for help from Wuhan's residents and doctors were to be echoed by those from Italy a few weeks later, and soon after the UK.Look back three months, and in China there were not enough tests to work out who had coronavirus, there was not enough protective equipment for medical staff treating patients, and then, soon, tragically there were not enough hospital beds and ventilators for sick patients. These are exactly the challenges faced by authorities from New York to Rome, London to Madrid.                     ... and the other country that didn't listen                   If the UK has serious questions to answer, the country that so far has seen the worst of the outbreak, the United States, was slowest of all to act. Trump for months ignored, played down or lied about the threat posed by coronavirus, leaving individual states to act unilaterally as it became clear it had already taken hold on US soil.On 17 March parts of California issued ""shelter in place"" orders, effectively a lockdown. By the end of that week New York City had also shut down, along with a dozen states, and the majority of the rest of the country had put some restrictions in place. Only five states had few or no controls.There have now been nearly 700,000 confirmed cases in the US and over 33,000 deaths; actual numbers are likely to be higher for both. The economy has also been devastated, with more than 22 million out of work as businesses collapse or shrink under the strain.Trump insists the US is turning a corner, and has tried to blame - among other targets - the WHO for failing to fully raise the alarm, and has stripped it of its US funding.There have certainly been questions about the organisation's strong praise for China and the exclusion of Taiwan, which may have contributed to the delay in recognising human-to-human transmission was occurring. But it began daily briefings on 22 January and had declared aglobal health emergency by the end of that month.While initially sceptical about China's distancing measures, it urged other countries to adopt them once there was evidence they were working. It warned about shortages of PPE over a month ago, and since the beginning of the outbreak has urged countries, including the UK, to ""test, test, test"" to contain the virus - a strategy followed by almost all countries that have managed to suppress it.A senior Whitehall source with detailed knowledge of the UK's response and those of other countries said: ""The fact is that those countries who knew a lot about Sars quickly saw the danger. But in the UK the attitude among politicians and also scientists was that it was really just some form of a flu. All the government's pandemic planning was based on a flu scenario. And then it turned out to be something different and far, far worse and the response was completely...",'herd_immunity,,"(78, '""the plan, as explained by the chief science adviser, is to work towards \'herd_immunity\', which is to have the majority of the population contract the virus, develop antibodies and then become immune to it.')",319
526,526,The government coronavirus advice kept secret until now,"May 5, 2020 Tuesday","After calls for greater transparency the government published more of the guidance from the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) that has informed its response to the pandemic.                   GRADING ACTIVITIES BY RISK                   By April 1, two months after Britain's first confirmed cases of Covid-19, the experts could see evidence that the outbreak was waning. ""We are aware that modelling colleagues estimate that the changes already in place have probably reduced R to below 1,"" a subcommittee of behavioural scientists known as SPI-B, which feeds into Sage, said. That would mean that each infected person was resulting in less than one new case.The SPI-B panel still advocated rigorous restrictions, however. Measures should be considered to stop vulnerable people being employed in ""high-risk environments"", it said. A sudden resurgence of the virus would be seen as ""a serious failure of policy and trust in public health advice will be lost"".The panel backed a cautious and incremental exit from lockdown, possibly involving ""rapid pilot trials"" of looser restrictions in less-affected areas. The ""simple rules"" of lockdown would have to be replaced by more complicated messaging, it said. Day-to-day activities could be graded according to risk, following the ""traffic light"" system used to promote healthy foods. It suggested a public education campaign in which activities were graded as ""high-risk (avoid), medium (do rarely and carefully) and low (do freely)"".                   JOHNSON SHAKES OFF ADVICE                   On March 3 SPI-B had cautioned against close physical contact. ""Government should advise against greetings such as shaking hands and hugging, given existing evidence about the importance of hand hygiene,"" the panel said. On the same day Boris Johnson told a No 10 press conference that he was still shaking hands. ""People obviously can make up their own minds but I think the scientific evidence is, our judgment is, that washing your hands is the crucial thing,"" he said.                   FEARS OF PUBLIC COMPLACENCY                   On March 12 Sir Patrick Vallance, the chief scientific adviser, spoke to Sky News about the potential advantages of people becoming infected and immune. By March 23 - when lockdown was imposed - he was wrestling with how to impress on the public just how dangerous Covid-19 had proven to be. ""A substantial number of people still do not feel sufficiently personally threatened,"" SPI-B said. ""The perceived level of personal threat needs to be increased among those who are complacent, using hard-hitting emotional messaging.Earlier government messaging had been a mistake. ""There seems to be insufficient understanding of, or feelings of responsibility about, people's role in transmitting the infection to others. This may have resulted in part from messaging around the low level of risk to most people and talk of the desirability of building 'herd immunity' .""There was criticism of advice given to vulnerable people to self-isolate. ""The guidance is vague,"" the scientists said. ""The phrase 'aim to' is too weak - the guidance should promote action not aims."" People had been told to wipe down surfaces but official advice had not told them to use disinfectant.                   DARK FORECASTS FOR THE NHS                   On March 20 the SPI-M-O committee, which includes specialists on flu epidemics, said: ""It is very likely we will see ICU capacity in London breached by the end of the month, even if additional measures are put in place today."" The rest of the country was one to two weeks behind. ""In the absence of additional measures being put into place in the next few days, it is likely that we will breach ICU capacity in other regions.""This was in a report to Sage, not to ministers. Earlier in March the scientists estimated that 12 per cent of people ill enough to be admitted to hospital with Covid-19 would die. The latest data shows a proportion of 33 per cent.                   DOUBTS ON IMMUNITY PASSPORTS                   On April 13 SPI-B voiced concerns over the idea, floated by Matt Hancock, the health secretary, on April 1, that ""immunity passports"" could be used to allow some people to leave lockdown. Tests would have to be 98 per cent accurate to be approved by the regulator. Even then, large numbers of people would be given inaccurate results. The panel also warned that the system could lead to a black market in fake test results. ""If a test result is a requirement for a resumption of work, strategies to 'game' the system may arise,"" it said. ""These include people deliberately seeking out infection or attempting to purchase a fake test result, commercial organisations selling unapproved tests, or approved tests becoming available through private organisations at prices that make them unavailable to most.""It also warned that ""some employers may discriminate on the basis of antibody status"".                   FAIRNESS                   The scientists often observed that the poorest and most vulnerable suffer the worst effects of lockdown and disease. They warn of frustration if policies are seen as unfair - if, for instance, particular religious or ethnic groups are prevented from meeting or if sporting events take place behind closed doors but are available on TV to subscribers.They also recognise that Britain is being compared with other countries and a memo dated March 12 suggested frustration at the pace of ministers. ""SPI-B has pointed out repeatedly that trust will be lost in sections of the public if measures witnessed in other countries are not adopted in the UK and that not pursuing such routes needs to be well explained.""                   THE SCHOOLS DILEMMA                   On March 2 the scientific advisers said that the epidemic seen in Wuhan was ""inconsistent with no transmission from/to children"". Specialists on respiratory diseases advised that ""school closures are likely to impact transmission [of Covid], although significantly less than with flu"".On March 4, however, SPI-B voiced concern over a potential public backlash. ""School closures will be highly disruptive and likely to present an unequal burden to different sections of society,"" the panel said. It pointed to Japan, where it said the policy was giving rise to growing discontent. On March 14, the closure of schools and ""social distancing of over-65s"" were listed as only two measures with ""high confidence"" of limiting transmission of Covid-19. Three days later SPI-B said that it had ""not found a robust academic evidence base relating to the acceptability or social impact of dismissal v closure"".By March 17 and 18 Sage was grappling with locking down the capital. Concerns had been raised that restrictions there would cause people to flee, seeding the virus elsewhere. ""Seeding should not be a concern as infections are already present outside London,"" it said. It was agreed the biggest impact would be ""closing schools, colleges and universities; stopping leisure activities, including bars, restaurants and theatres; closing places of work"".Schools in England and Wales shut on March 20.                   Analysis                   Just how much ministers' response to the coronavirus has been driven by judgments on how the public would react is clear from the Sage documents published yesterday (Chris Smyth writes).Wariness at school closures seems to have been encouraged by reports of discontent at similar policies elsewhere. Even what now seems like a relatively mild policy of quarantine of those with symptoms seems to have been delayed by fears over its unequal social impact.The documents also reveal how the ""stay at home"" message was honed by fears that some people were complacent about the virus. Emotional messaging, stressing a direct personal threat, and appeals to social duty were suggested.This has worked so well that it limits ministers' freedom. Explaining more nuanced measures will be tricky, behavioural scientists concluded after the lockdown began.Those looking for evidence that ministers ignored scientists' warnings will be largely disappointed. Reluctance to lock down earlier can be explained by a conclusion on March 2 that such a policy would probably not reduce the ultimate number of infections. Sage had dramatically underestimated the speed of the spread.The only clear example of scientists suggesting faster action than the government took is a warning on March 20 that even immediate action would not stop London's intensive care units being overwhelmed. The prime minister waited three more days before taking nationwide action.",'herd_immunity,,"(21, ""this may have resulted in part from messaging around the low level of risk to most people and talk of the desirability of building 'herd_immunity' ."")",415
528,528,Top scientists publish stark warnings that forced Boris Johnson to call UK lockdown;Newly-revealed papers show Boris Johnson called lockdown after he was warned ICU would fill up in 11 days.

But the documents also show the science is never one clear piece of advice.And in a few cases, the government's action did not match up with what the documents say.For example, scientists appeared to say they were happy with a London-only shutdown of bars and restaurants rather than a UK-wide closure.But the government, after days of debate, went with a UK-wide shutdown instead.Meanwhile, the documents clearly spell out the dangers in the next phase when lockdown begins to ease.They warn any easing of lockdown must be ""very gradual"" -and give people back some of their leisure activities, not just restart the economy.And the scientists warn rogue bosses could exploit any system of ""immunity passports"" to hand riskier jobs to those who've already had Covid-19.                     Here are 9 things we've learned today.                                        1. Boris Johnson imposed lockdown after he was told ICU would fill up in 11 days                   Boris Johnson took his lockdown decision after being warned intensive care beds would fill up in 11 days.A ""consensus view"" on March 20, from the Scientific Pandemic Influenza Group on Modelling, warned the virus was doubling every three to five days.It said: ""It is very likely that we will see ICU capacity in London breached by the end of the month, even if additional measures are put in place today.""The rest of the UK is 1-2 weeks behind London. In the absence of additional measures being put into place in the next few days, it is likely that we will breach ICU capacity in other regions.""The Prime Minister -who had stopped short of a full lockdown -then announced one on March 23.SAGE warned even a lockdown would not stop capacity being breached, because it would take two to three weeks to take effect.But the NHS then announced the first of its Nightingale hospitals on March 24 -which meant the first peak did not exceed intensive care capacity.                     2. Boris Johnson boasted about shaking hands -on the same day scientists said not to                   Boris Johnson boasted he'd shaken hands with ""everybody"" at a hospital -on the same day the advisors agreed handshakes should stop.The Independent Scientific Pandemic Influenza Group on Behaviours, a subcommittee of SAGE, issued its advice on March 3.It said: ""There was agreement that Government should advise against greetings such as shaking hands and hugging, given existing evidence about the importance of hand hygiene.""Promoting a replacement greeting or encouraging others to politely decline a proffered hand-shake may have benefit.""Yet on the same day, Boris Johnson said he had not stopped shaking hands.He told the No10 press conference: ""I was at a hospital the other night where I think a few there were actually coronavirus patients.""And I shook hands with everybody, you'll be pleased to know, and I continue to shake hands.""Mr Johnson later said he'd stopped shaking hands -but only after shaking hands with Phillip Schofield and Anthony Joshua.Downing Street said the PM ""wouldn't have seen"" that specific paper on March 3 and may never have seen it. The document was only a submission to SAGE from its own subcommittee, not a report from SAGE to the government -which are kept secret.                     3. The virus was spreading much faster than the scientists thought                   SAGE admitted in late March that the 'R' number -the number of people each Covid-19 carrier infects -was higher than they first thought.They had previously estimated it at 2.4, but on March 20 admitted ""we cannot rule out it being higher than 3.""That meant it was spreading far faster than the government or the scientists had thought.Chief Scientific Advisor Sir Patrick Vallance has since said the R number was 3 in the early stages.                     4. Scientists lent support to a London-only lockdown -but it didn't happen                   The week of March 15 was gripped by rumours of a ""London lockdown"".These rumours were angrily denied at the time by Downing Street, which correctly said travel in and out of the capital would not be stopped.But actually we now know ""lockdown"" doesn't mean banning all transport. And the documents show the rumours were much closer to the truth than Downing Street would have us believe.SAGE held a discussion on March 17-18 about what it called -in its own words -a ""London lockdown.""The scientists agreed shutting schools, bars, restaurants, theatres and offices would have the greatest effect on transmitting the virus.And they made clear it could be London-only. The summary of the debate said: ""Concerns were raised over whether locking down London would cause people travel and seed the virus in other places.""It was confirmed that seeding in this way should not be a concern as infections are already present outside London.""But Boris Johnson decided not to do this. Instead he announced on March 20 that people should stop going to pubs, restaurants and bars UK-wide. A UK-wide lockdown followed on March 23.Similarly, SAGE evidence on April 1 shows experts suggested regional pilots of lifting the lockdown. But the government is not following this approach. Instead the lockdown will be eased UK-wide -but could be reimposed locally if there's a spike in one area.                     5. Scientists made the government change 'confusing' stay-at-home guidance                   Scientists hit out at the government's ""confusing"" stay-at-home guidance before it was tightened up to herald the UK-wide lockdown.Original advice -now withdrawn -said people should work from home ""where possible"" and ""avoid non-essential use of public transport when possible"".But on March 22, SAGE scientists agreed that was not clear enough to stop people putting themselves at risk.They wrote: ""Phrases such as 'as much as is practicable', 'non-essential', 'significantly limit', and 'gathering' are open to wide differences in interpretation.""This can lead to confusion about exactly what people are being required to do e.g. gathering outside or going for walks. Guidance now needs to be reformulated to be behaviourally specific.""They also said the guidance must be combined with ""hard-hitting emotional messaging"" showing people the ""personal threat"" to their health.                     6. The experts warn the lockdown must only be lifted 'very gradually'                   More recent guidance from April 1 shows scientists agree the lockdown cannot be lifted in a hurry.They say this isn't just because of the health benefits -if there's a second peak, it will undermine the entire public's trust in government advice.The paper was drawn up by the scientific pandemic influenza group on behaviour SPI-B.It says: ""If there is then an increase in infection rates that necessitates a reintroduction of restrictions this is likely to be seen as a serious failure of policy and trust in public health advice will be lost, leading to lower adherence to advice to restrict or to resume activity.""To avoid these problems we would advocate trialling easing restrictions very gradually when epidemiologically indicated.""While clearly explaining why these particular activities are being resumed and how risks must be controlled if these activities are to be maintained.""                     7. Lockdown must not just ease for work -leisure is important too                   In the same meeting on April 1, scientists urged the government to let people return to leisure activities -not just work.""To maintain public trust and support it will be important to have acceptable and equitable criteria for selecting which activities can be resumed,"" they agreed.""For example, it may be difficult to justify easing restrictions solely for economic activities without any easing of restrictions for low risk activities with significant social and psychological benefit.""                     8. 'Immunity passports' could be hijacked by rogue employers -and put staff at risk                   Rogue bosses could give riskier jobs to people who have had Covid-19 -thinking they're immune when they're not, the advisors say.In a paper on April 13, the scientific pandemic influenza group on behaviour SPI-B said employers might ""actively discriminate"" against workers who were not shown to have antibodies.The experts also say any 'immunity passports' -which have not yet been proven to work -could be hijacked by people trying to ""game the system"".It's not yet been proven if having antibodies makes you immune to getting Covid-19 twice. And there is not yet a reliable antibody test available.The government's advice warns even a 2% fail rate could lead to dozens of people in every thousand going back to work, or isolating, with the wrong advice.The note added: ""Some employers may discriminate on the basis of antibody status.""This might include not permitting those testing antibody negative to return to work or only taking on new staff with antibody positive test results.""Work may also be allocated among employees based on test status with, for example, customer-facing work being allocated to those who have tested antibody positive.""In some circumstances this may be appropriate, but in others this might constitute adverse discrimination. This risk applies across all occupational sectors.""The note also warned about the risk of people trying to ""game"" the system by attempting to purchase a fake test result one way or the other.                     9. And finally... 'herd immunity' was discussed                   Some of the behavioural scientists suggested publicising the concept of ""herd immunity"" -to explain why the UK was not imposing social distancing measures in early March.This is highly controversial because government has insisted ""herd immunity"" was never its plan.Instead, they've more described it as a fact of life -the only way to permanently protect the population is through 'herd immunity', either by a vaccine or lots of people getting sick and recovering.But this isn't government policy so they insist because it would lead to hundreds of thousands of deaths.A paper dated March 4, considered by Sage on March 5, said: ""SPI-B scientific pandemic influenza group on behaviours have divergent opinions on the impact of not applying widescale social isolation at the same time as recommending isolation to at-risk groups.""One view is that explaining that members of the community are building some immunity will make this acceptable.""Another view is that recommending isolation to only one section of society risks causing discontent.""

552,552,"Traffic lights, hand-shaking and complacency: the advice","May 6, 2020 Wednesday","After calls for greater transparency the government published more of the guidance from the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) that has informed its response to the pandemic.grading activities by risk By April 1, two months after Britain's first confirmed cases of Covid-19, the experts could see evidence that the outbreak was waning. ""We are aware that modelling colleagues estimate that the changes already in place have probably reduced R to below 1,"" a subcommittee of behavioural scientists known as SPI-B, which feeds into Sage, said. That would mean that each infected person was resulting in less than one new case.The SPI-B panel still advocated rigorous restrictions, however. Measures should be considered to stop vulnerable people being employed in ""high-risk environments"", it said. A sudden resurgence of the virus would be seen as ""a serious failure of policy and trust in public health advice will be lost"".The panel backed a cautious and incremental exit from lockdown, possibly involving ""rapid pilot trials"" of looser restrictions in less-affected areas. The ""simple rules"" of lockdown would have to be replaced by more complicated messaging, it said. Day-to-day activities could be graded according to risk, following the ""traffic light"" system used to promote healthy foods. It suggested a public education campaign in which activities were graded as ""high-risk (avoid), medium (do rarely and carefully) and low (do freely)"".johnson shakes off advice On March 3 SPI-B had cautioned against close physical contact. ""Government should advise against greetings such as shaking hands and hugging, given existing evidence about the importance of hand hygiene,"" the panel said. On the same day Boris Johnson told a No 10 press conference that he was still shaking hands. ""People obviously can make up their own minds but I think the scientific evidence is, our judgment is, that washing your hands is the crucial thing,"" he said.fears of public complacency On March 12 Sir Patrick Vallance, the chief scientific adviser, spoke to Sky News about the potential advantages of people becoming infected and immune. By March 23 - when lockdown was imposed - he was wrestling with how to impress on the public just how dangerous Covid-19 had proven to be. ""A substantial number of people still do not feel sufficiently personally threatened,"" SPI-B said. ""The perceived level of personal threat needs to be increased among those who are complacent, using hard-hitting emotional messaging."" Earlier government messaging had been a mistake. ""There seems to be insufficient understanding of, or feelings of responsibility about, people's role in transmitting the infection to others. This may have resulted in part from messaging around the low level of risk to most people and talk of the desirability of building 'herd immunity' ."" There was criticism of advice given to vulnerable people to self-isolate. ""The guidance is vague,"" the scientists said. ""The phrase 'aim to' is too weak - the guidance should promote action not aims."" People had been told to wipe down surfaces but official advice had not told them to use disinfectant.dark forecasts for the nhs On March 20 the SPI-M-O committee, which includes specialists on flu epidemics, said: ""It is very likely we will see ICU capacity in London breached by the end of the month, even if additional measures are put in place today."" The rest of the country was one to two weeks behind. ""In the absence of additional measures being put into place in the next few days, it is likely that we will breach ICU capacity in other regions.""This was in a report to Sage, not to ministers. Earlier in March the scientists estimated that 12 per cent of people ill enough to be admitted to hospital with Covid-19 would die. The latest data shows a proportion of 33 per cent.doubts on immunity passports On April 13 SPI-B voiced concerns over the idea, floated by Matt Hancock, the health secretary, on April 1, that ""immunity passports"" could be used to allow some people to leave lockdown. Tests would have to be 98 per cent accurate to be approved by the regulator. Even then, large numbers of people would be given inaccurate results. The panel also warned that the system could lead to a black market in fake test results. ""If a test result is a requirement for a resumption of work, strategies to 'game' the system may arise,"" it said. ""These include people deliberately seeking out infection or attempting to purchase a fake test result, commercial organisations selling unapproved tests, or approved tests becoming available through private organisations at prices that make them unavailable to most.""It also warned that ""some employers may discriminate on the basis of antibody status"".fairness The scientists often observed that the poorest and most vulnerable suffer the worst effects of lockdown and disease. They warn of frustration if policies are seen as unfair - if, for instance, particular religious or ethnic groups are prevented from meeting or if sporting events take place behind closed doors but are available on TV to subscribers.They also recognise that Britain is being compared with other countries and a memo dated March 12 suggested frustration at the pace of ministers. ""SPI-B has pointed out repeatedly that trust will be lost in sections of the public if measures witnessed in other countries are not adopted in the UK and that not pursuing such routes needs to be well explained.""the schools dilemma On March 2 the scientific advisers said that the epidemic seen in Wuhan was ""inconsistent with no transmission from/to children"". Specialists on respiratory diseases advised that ""school closures are likely to impact transmission [of Covid], although significantly less than with flu"".On March 4, however, SPI-B voiced concern over a potential public backlash. ""School closures will be highly disruptive and likely to present an unequal burden to different sections of society,"" the panel said. It pointed to Japan, where it said the policy was giving rise to growing discontent. On March 14, the closure of schools and ""social distancing of over-65s"" were listed as only two measures with ""high confidence"" of limiting transmission of Covid-19. Three days later SPI-B said that it had ""not found a robust academic evidence base relating to the acceptability or social impact of dismissal v closure"".By March 17 and 18 Sage was grappling with locking down the capital. Concerns had been raised that restrictions there would cause people to flee, seeding the virus elsewhere. ""Seeding should not be a concern as infections are already present outside London,"" it said. It was agreed the biggest impact would be ""closing schools, colleges and universities; stopping leisure activities, including bars, restaurants and theatres; closing places of work"".Schools in England and Wales shut on March 20.",'herd_immunity,,"(21, 'this may have resulted in part from messaging around the low level of risk to most people and talk of the desirability of building \'herd_immunity\' .""')",439
