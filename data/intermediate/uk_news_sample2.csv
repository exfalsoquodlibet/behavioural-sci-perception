It sent out a very clear message to the community that the government had, at least implicitly, a dismissive attitude towards them.""""When it comes to human behaviour language is utterly critical and I think it [Mr Halpern's language] was at best unfortunate language.""David Halpern's comments on herd immunity created disquiet among other some other behavioural scientists and psychologists.Professor Reicher was speaking to Econ Film's CoronaNomics show.Also appearing was Cass Sunstein, the doyen of ""nudge"" theory at Harvard Law School and someone who has profoundly influenced Mr Halpern's own team's approach.""David Halpern is a great public servant and he has done extraordinary work in many domains including this domain,"" said Professor Sunstein.""The idea of herd immunity - he didn't invent that term. That's a well known term. He said we want herd immunity for a certain segment of the population - those who aren't particularly vulnerable to the disease.""Mr Sunstein added: ""I'm not sure I would subscribe to that as the right policy - in fact I think I wouldn't - but that has nothing to do with behavioural science.""In a statement released to The Independent, a spokesperson for the Behavioural Insights Team said: ""Professor Halpern's remark, at the end of a much longer interview, most of which remains unseen, was intended to emphasise the importance of protecting the most vulnerable. As Professor Sunstein noted, herd immunity is a specific term from epidemiology which David referenced in this instance for ease of understanding around this incredibly important issue.""""When looking at strategies to change behaviours, we agree that phrasing is incredibly important - which is why we have run tests with over 100,000 participants on COVID language and messaging and continue to do so to contribute wherever we can to help beat this pandemic."" The BIT also stressed that at the time of Dr Halpern's BBC interview on 11 March there had only been around 10 recorded coronavirus deaths and strenuously rejected the idea that his remarks had shown any lack of concern for the victims up to that point or subsequently. Another controversy around behavioural science policy in the pandemic has been the idea that the population would have grown ""fatigued"" with lockdown it if was introduced too early.The UK's Chief Medical Officer, Chris Whitty, said on 9 March warned of ""a risk if we go too early people will understandably get fatigued and it will be difficult to sustain this over time"".The nudge unit appearedto have briefed to journalists that there was a danger of fatigue on 11 March, although it insists that it never did so.And Professor Reicher also believes that this idea did not, in fact, come from the nudge unit.""Whether you are talking about the Behavioural Insights Team in Number 10 or psychologists and other social scientists advising government on behaviour, neither of us talked about behavioural fatigue. It didn't come from psychologists or indeed from behavioural scientists,"" he told CoronaNomics.""You can look at the papers and public record and you'll see that very clearly.""The Behavioural Insights Team was founded in 2010, within the Cabinet Office, to offer in house policy advice to the Coalition.It was spun out as social purpose limited company in 2014, but remains partly owned by the Cabinet Office.

1,"Nudge theory could heal Brexit Britain's divide over lockdown;The theory received bad press, but it could help reconcile those who value freedom and those who want to minimise harm Coronavirus - latest updatesSee all our coronavirus coverage","May 20, 2020 Wednesday",International,The Guardian (London),920,920,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,Lee de Wit,"Nudge theory could heal Brexit Britain's divide over lockdownThe theory received bad press, but it could help reconcile those who value freedom and those who want to minimise harm Coronavirus - latest updatesSee all our coronavirus coverage","There was a rare moment of relative unity in the UK at the start of April when nine out of 10 people said they supported the lockdown. However, as the government seeks to ease the lockdown, a polarised landscape is starting to re-emerge, the fault lines reflecting attitudes toward Brexit. A recent            YouGov survey found that 47% of leavers supported the government's easing of the lockdown compared with 26% of remainers.Remainers and leavers both indicated high levels of support for letting people exercise outside more than once a day, but YouGov found that leavers showed more support than remainers for allowing people to play tennis or golf, visit garden centres, meet one friend, sit and sunbathe in public areas like parks, and encourage people to return to work.Why would support for Brexit correlate with attitudes towards easing the lockdown? One might think this is simply due to confirmation bias. Brexit supporters who backed Boris might be motivated to look out for evidence that their candidate is doing a good job. I suspect, however, the factors driving polarised responses to coronavirus run deeper than that. To understand these factors, it's helpful to look back on some of the psychological characteristics of people who supported leave or remain.Two of these differences can be explained by what American social psychologist Jonathan Haidt describes as ""the moral intuitions"", the underlying values that shape how we think about politics. Remainers            placed more emphasis on the value of care and the need to minimise harm, whereas leavers placed more emphasis on the value of personal liberty. When evaluating an action or a policy, remainers would ask ""will this cause harm?"", whereas leavers would be inclined to ask ""will something restrict our  freedom?"".This emphasis on care/harm versus liberty has quite logical consequences in terms of how opinions divide on easing from the lockdown. The emphasis on care and minimising harm puts the focus on reducing the spread of the disease at all costs. Interestingly, the care/harm reasoning is stronger among women. This might help to explain the gender difference in            concern around coronavirus, and why male and            female leaders have responded differently to the first wave of the virus. We also know that endorsement of liberty is associated with            vaccine hesitancy, so we can expect those who are opposed to further lockdown to also be more likely to oppose a mandatory vaccine.We might disagree with the values underlying people's political beliefs, but understanding the depth of moral sentiment that shapes these different responses could provide a more effective basis for communication or persuasion. Neglecting to do so risks getting us back to a position where people stop listening to the other side - not because they don't have good ideas, but simply because they are in the ""other"" camp.In other domains where we critically need collective action in order to avert further crisis, a deeper understanding of the moral values underpinning politically polarised positions has resulted in more persuasive communication. Indeed, American sociologist Robb Willer and colleagues            have argued that the left in particular needs to learn how to better engage with moral intuitions of the right in communications designed to tackle challenges like climate change. A lesson adopted by centre-left leaders like Barack Obama, who framed the investment in renewables as an issue of national security.Finding a policy response that reconciles the tension between concerns for liberty and care was actually at the heart of the original formulation of the idea of a ""nudge"". The concept has got something of a bad press after it was associated with herd immunity, so let's set the record straight, nudge theory has nothing to do with herd immunity.Chicago University economist Richard Thaler and legal scholar Cass Sunstein originally developed the concept of nudge as a reconciliation between ""paternalistic"" state intervention and the liberty of the individual. One of their key insights is that providing people with information regarding the right thing to do, is often not sufficient to change behaviour. It is sometimes necessary to make structural changes to people's environments to make the desired behaviour easy. Hospital staff, for example, know that washing their hands is important,            but are still more likely to do so if hand sanitiser is easily available and visible in the hospital.As we explore how to safely restore some personal freedoms while minimising the harm caused by the spread of the virus, we will need people to engage in a range of behaviours, from social distancing to washing their hands, wearing masks, download tracing apps, and (hopefully one day) getting vaccinated. Governments have a huge role to play in structuring our daily environments to make it easy to engage in the behaviours we need to engage in. Telling people to follow ""common sense"" is likely to prove a lot less effective than making masks easily available, or making hand sanitisers more widespread in public buildings.There is no quick fix to Get Corona Done. However, behavioural science can help create new habits to slow the rate of infection until a vaccine is created - and a little bit of understanding of the values behind people's beliefs will go a long way to avoid the spread of further division.

2,The behavioural scientists do more harm than good,"June 22, 2020 Monday",International,The Times (London),449,449,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,Martha Gill,The behavioural scientists do more harm than good,"If it wasn't clear then, it certainly is now. Among the biggest mistakes ministers have made in the coronavirus crisis has been to listen to behavioural scientists. The idea that early restrictions would create ""behavioural fatigue"" in the public, who would then start breaking the rules, led the government directly to a fatal delay in imposing lockdown.But it was the wrong theory. The public had been eager for lockdown - government approval ratings shot up afterwards - and turned out to be far more compliant than the nudgers had guessed. The delay, meanwhile, cost many lives.Is this the end, then, for soft science in policy-making? Not a bit of it. Ministers are reportedly planning to base another vast, consequential campaign on behavioural science: getting people and businesses ready for Brexit. The campaign, leading up to the end of the transition period, is to focus on provoking feelings of ""loss avoidance"" between December and January, and then, in the new year, the idea of ""new opportunities"". Much is at stake in this campaign. If businesses do not prepare sufficiently, many will go under.It is perhaps not hard to see why ministers find it so hard to detach from behavioural science, despite its flaws. Among the many schemes that emanated from David Cameron's ""nudge unit"" were a few successes: more were persuaded to pay their taxes on time, for example. Campaigns and policy-making rely on understanding human behaviour, and any discipline that promises reliable data on the subject is compelling. It is also rather easy to find a behavioural scientist who agrees with you.But that's the problem. Behavioural science is not a science. The discipline has been hit by a ""replication crisis"" - results of even well-known studies cannot always be reproduced. Few experimental conditions can be controlled and it is often difficult even to define terms. With little way to prove their hunches wrong, behavioural scientists often assume they are right.That matters when the ""science"" is applied to policy decisions. While many of behavioural science's insights are mere common sense (people are more likely to turn up for GP appointments when you remind them to), they are dressed up as fact. Other ideas - for example, that in an emergency people tend not to mind if their leaders seem overcautious, or that news from Italy was sufficiently frightening in early March for the British public to accept lockdown - may not be given a fair hearing. Besides, behavioural scientists are lobbyists for their own brand of thinking. They are not impartial advisers, and it is time the government stopped treating them as such. They should ditch them altogether. There is evidence enough.",Newspaper

It is now mandatory for anyone using public transport to wear a face covering to help contain the spread of coronavirus. The new law, which started on June 14, meant anyone not wearing a face covering on public transport could be fined £100 in England.But according to Professor Susan Michie, a member of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies' Sage subgroup on behavioural science, some people do not know how to correctly put a face mask on and are putting themselves and other commuters at risk. According to the gov.uk website, a face covering ""should cover your mouth and nose while allowing you to breathe comfortably"", YorkshireLive reports. ""Wash your hands or use hand sanitiser before putting it on and after taking it off,"" the website advises.""Avoid touching your eyes, nose or mouth at all times and store used face coverings in a plastic bag until you have an opportunity to wash them.""Do not touch the front of the face covering or the part of the face covering that has been in contact with your mouth and nose.

""Many of us pointed that out in order to argue for greater clarity and greater support for people ... we vigorously opposed the notion of fatigue as rooted in psychological frailty or its use to argue against restrictions.""He added that the behavioural scientists advising Sage argued ""that people are resilient, that they can cope with tough times if given adequate information and adequate support"".

Keeping our hands below our shoulders, carrying sanitiser and learning the Vulcan salute are among the suggestions. ""We've all become familiar in recent months with personal protective equip-ment,"" Robert West of University College London, who is on the government's SPI-B behavioural science advisory committee, said. ""As restrictions are relaxed, we're going to need to learn about personal protective behaviour.""Although no one is shaking hands at the moment, Professor West suggested that encouraging alternative ways of greeting could reinforce norms about social distancing for the future. These include a ""namaste"" gesture with palms together over the breastbone with bowed head. Professor West said that his favourite was the ""Vulcan salute"" from the Star Trek franchise, with the palm raised and fingers parted between the middle and ring fingers.Professor West and Professor Susan Michie, who is also at UCL and a member of SPI-B, have written a paper in Nature Human Behaviour with Dr James Rubin of King's College London, who chairs SPI-B and sits on the government's Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies. The scientists said that developing clear advice on behaviour that was easy to follow could have a ""substantial"" effect on the transmission of the virus. Behavioural science research shows that people are more likely to stick to advice if it is very specific and has rules that can become habits. ""Good hygiene reduces the risk that the virus on your hands gets into the body, so if people get used to washing their hands every time they come home, it becomes second nature and easy to stick to,"" Professor West said.""Another simple rule that's easy to follow is to carry hand sanitiser - soon everyone will be carrying it.""In theory, an individual could prevent the virus from getting into their eyes, nose and mouth via their hands by simply stopping touching their face.However, this is such an automatic and unconscious habit that Professor West said: ""Just telling people not touch their eyes, nose and mouth might not be helpful. Rather than just telling people not to do it, we can increase their ability to do it by telling them about another behaviour they can do that conflicts with it. In this case it could be 'keep your hands below shoulder level'.""",Newspaper

Cafes and coffee shops have been slashing their workforce as demand has all-but dried up in many towns and cities, with huge numbers still working from home rather than going to the office. The Government's concerns now seem to shifting to the economic health of the country, with fears that 1980s-style unemployment will make a comeback unless normal consumer behaviour resumes. Forecasts now predict that the UK jobless rate will top 10 per cent by the end of the year.Although the Prime Minister has consistently said his Government 'follows the science' on coronavirus policy, it is not yet clear whether Chief Medical Officer Professor Chris Whitty and Sir Patrick Vallance, the Chief Scientific Adviser and Sage chairman, have approved the change in message.Despite Mr Johnson's comments earlier today, the official guidance remains the same, and those who can work from home should continue to do so, a Downing Street spokesperson told MailOnline. There are concerns that many staff will be unable to return even if they want to, as social distancing rules mean there is not enough physical space on offices and public transport cannot run at full capacity. Mr Johnson said today: 'I want people to go back to work as carefully as possible.

The Government's bid to get more business open last Saturday has allowed Tesco to reduce queues outside by introducing more customers inside.Tesco, which has around 3,700 UK stores, joined other supermarkets in enforcing one-way queues and a new one-in-one-out entry plan in March. Other supermarkets including Aldi introduced a traffic light system at entrances to keep to the two-metre social distancing gap.Tesco said it will monitor how many customers visit now measures have been relaxed but some stores are now allowing more people inside at one time.The number of customers allowed in each branch will be decided by store managers, so will vary across the country. In his remarks today, the Prime Minister said: 'I think everybody has sort of taken the ''stay at home if you can'' - I think we should now say, well, ''go back to work if you can''. Because I think it's very important that people should try to lead their lives more normally.'I want to see more people feeling confident to use the shops, use the restaurants, and get back into work - but only if we all follow the guidance.'Mr Johnson also hinted that face coverings will be made compulsory in shops in a bid to reassure nervous customers. He admitted that 'the balance of scientific opinion seemed to have shifted' over how effective makeshift masks can be.'I do think we need to be stricter in insisting people wear face coverings in confined spaces where they are meeting people they don't normally meet,' Mr Johnson said.'We are looking at ways of making sure that people really do have face coverings in shops, for instance, where there is a risk of transmission.' The shift came after lockdown was significantly eased in England from last Saturday, with pubs and restaurants allowed to open as long as they have 'Covid Secure' precautions in place. However, the PM's advice for UK employees to work from home where possible seeming still applied until now. In response to the Prime Minister's new advice, General Secretary of shop and distribution workers' trade union Usdaw, Paddy Lillis, told MailOnline: 'The Covid-19 pandemic is still very much with us and Usdaw urges the Government to proceed with caution and follow the science. 'The releasing of lockdown must happen at a pace that ensures there isn't a second spike in infections. Usdaw hasn't called for the mandatory wearing of face coverings, but now it has been introduced in Scotland we will monitor how it works. 'We welcome anything that helps to keep customers and shop workers safe, but the most important measure is to maintain proper social distancing and hygiene. 'That's why Usdaw is urging employers to stay with the established two-metre distancing, keep using screens at tills and limiting the number of shoppers in store at any one time. 'We also want to be clear that it should never fall on shopworkers to enforce the wearing of face coverings, they are already dealing with more abuse than normal and this could be another flashpoint.'How many jobs are at risk across the UK?•Accenture - 900•Airbus - 1,700•Arcadia - 500•BA - 12,000•Beales - 1,052•Bentley - 1,000•Burger King - 1,600•Casual Dining Group (Bella Italia, Cafe Rouge and Las Iguanas) - 1,900•DHL at Jaguar Land Rover - 2,200•EasyJet - 4,500•Go Outdoors - 2,400•Harrods - 700•Harveys - 240•Links - 350•Mothercare - 2,500•Oasis Warehouse - 1,800•P&O Ferries - 1,100•Pret a Manger - 1,330•Ryanair - 3,000•SSP Group (Upper Crust, Caffe Ritazza) - 5,000•Ted Baker - 160•TM Lewin - 600•Tui - 8,000•Victoria's Secret - 800 at riskIn more evidence of the woes on the high street today, pharmacies insisted they need £370million of loans for PPE and other coronavirus measures turned into a grant by the government.The chair of the National Pharmacy Association Andrew Lane said: ""There are many community pharmacies up and down the country on the financial brink, crippled by the extra cost of COVID19. If they close, the towns and villages they serve will lose a popular and life-saving asset.'Similarly, if the government is serious about stopping the slow death of the high street it needs to act now and put its money where its mouth is. 'The government managed to find more than a billion pounds for the arts sector yet is dithering over financial aid to frontline health workers.' Earlier today the owner of Wagamama and Frankie & Benny's said one in 10 of its restaurants will not reopen before the end of the year.The Restaurant Group said the stores - largely in airports - will open next year at the earliest as they are unlikely to attract enough customers to make it worthwhile.Those affected are in areas 'where footfall is anticipated to remain considerably weak', the company said in an update for shareholders on Friday.It raises concerns for the jobs of those who work at the sites, as the Government's furlough scheme, which covers salaries, will end in October.It is the latest firm to reveal it is struggling due to the coronavirus crisis, following Boots, John Lewis, Rolls Royce and Burger King this week.The news is another blow to Rishi Sunak's battle to keep Britons in work as it emerged nearly 60,000 workers face redundancy.A series of businesses pulled the trigger on layoffs less than a day after the Chancellor delivered a £30billion package designed to keep people off the dole.The Restaurant Group did not immediately provide an answer to what will happen to its staff.All the stores that will reopen this year will have started serving customers by the end of September, the company said.Meanwhile, 60 per cent of its sites that open before the end of August can take advantage of the Government's Eat Out to Help Out scheme, which gives diners up to 50 per cent off their meal during the first three days of the week.One in four of the Restaurant Group's restaurants and pubs will be open by the end of this month.It told investors: 'The group has now started a phased reopening of its restaurants and pubs for eat-in trade in line with Government guidance.'We are very pleased to be able to welcome back our customers and colleagues ensuring that their safety is paramount, whilst maintaining an enjoyable experience.'The diversified portfolio of the group allows each division to adapt to the challenges of social distancing uniquely, whilst keeping the customer at the heart of every decision.'The news comes at a turbulent time for the company. Last month it announced 125 Frankie & Benny's sites will close permanently, with 3,000 jobs on the line.It will be left with around 400 restaurants and pubs after the restructuring. The company's board took a 40 per cent pay cut at the start of April as they tapped into Government furlough money.On Friday they upped their pay, but will still take 20 per cent less than normal until all staff are off Government-backed furlough.Who is that masked man? Boris Johnson appears in a face covering for the first time after hinting they WILL be made compulsory in shops•Boris Johnson has been seen wearing a face covering in public for the first time•It comes after PM hinted masks could be made compulsory in shops in England•Nicola Sturgeon has made the coverings compulsory in shops in Scotland•Poll for MailOnline finds 61 per cent of public in England want to follow suitBoris Johnson has been seen wearing a face mask for the first time today after he had hinted the coverings would be made compulsory in shops in England.The prime minister was spotted wearing the covering while out greeting shop owners in his Uxbridge constituency this afternoon. The UK government currently recommends measures such as a face covering should be taken if people cannot keep two metres away from each other indoors.However, unlike Scotland - where coverings became compulsory in shops from today - the only place they are mandated is public transport. A poll for MailOnline has found 61 per cent of the public want to follow the example north of the border on the issue.Speaking during an online Q&A session with members of the public, the PM admitted that 'the balance of scientific opinion seemed to have shifted' over how effective masks can be.'I do think we need to be stricter in insisting people wear face coverings in confined spaces where they are meeting people they don't normally meet,' Mr Johnson said.'We are looking at ways of making sure that people really do have face coverings in shops, for instance, where there is a risk of transmission.' Earlier, Mr Johnson faced questions over why he had yet to be seen in a mask in public, before later wearing one.By contrast, Nicola Sturgeon has appeared in public sporting a tartan model, and has trolled Mr Johnson by retweeting an article asking why Westminster politicians are not wearing them.A poll by Redfield & Wilton Strategies for MailOnline found 61 per cent of the public in England would like to see coverings enforced in shops and supermarkets - with just 26 per cent opposed. And new figures from the Office for National Statistics today suggested half of adults are already routinely donning them. Health Secretary Matt Hancock has been seen wearing a mask while visiting a hospital, while Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden also wore one while attending a gallery this week.But despite revealing he has a Florence Nightingale mask, the PM has not been seen wearing it. Chancellor Rishi Sunak faced a backlash yesterday after he was pictured serving food to customers at a Wagamamas in London without a face covering. [item name=video id=4472668 style=2 /]London mayor Sadiq Khan has written to the PM saying he is 'disappointed and frustrated' that the Government has not said masks must be worn in 'busy and enclosed public places'. The Labour politician added: 'Face coverings are not only vital for public health. 'They could play an increasing role in supporting public confidence and our economic recovery.' [related]When asked whether such a gesture was according to social distancing rules, the PM's spokesman said: 'The guidance is clear that you should stay two metres apart where you can. 'If that's not possible, it is one metre, plus mitigation, and that mitigation has been set out in the guidance.' In a round of interviews this morning, culture minister Caroline Dinenage said she wears a mask 'all the time' as the Government came under pressure to answer why more senior figures had not been pictured wearing face coverings. Ms Dinenage, when asked if she had worn a covering since the coronavirus pandemic started, said she regularly wore face masks made by her son and that she had posted an image of herself wearing it on social media.To mark face masks being made mandatory on public transport last month, the Tory MP tweeted a picture of herself on June 5 while wearing a cloth covering.Ms Dinenage told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: 'I wear mine all the time.[item name=video id=4472674 style=2 /]'I have a fashion design student as a son who has run me up a few on his sewing machine and I wear them all the time.'A lot of us are out there wearing them as we go about our daily lives.'Ms Dinenage said 'you'd have to ask the Prime Minister and the Chancellor' when questioned why neither of the highest ranking ministers had been photographed wearing a covering in public.She said 'lots of my colleagues' had taken to wearing a face covering, adding: 'If the scientific evidence proves that it (the guidance on masks) definitely is something that needs to change, then of course we will.'Asked whether the government had considered introducing a similar rule to Scotland in England, Ms Dinenage told the BBC: 'Yes of course, and they are mandatory on public transport.[item name=video id=4472672 style=2 /][item name=video id=4472670 style=2 /]'But we have said face coverings in closed spaces is advised, but people can use their own discretion - but of course we will keep this under review.'This is a topic upon which scientists tend to have rather different views so we are looking at it as new scientific studies emerge.'The ONS survey was conducted between July 2-5, with 52 per cent of the public saying they had worn a face covering in the previous week - up from 43 per cent the week before..The president of the Royal Society this week recommended that everyone should wear a face covering in public to reduce the risk of a second wave of Covid-19 infections.Professor Venki Ramakrishna said people should wear a mask when they leave home - particularly in enclosed indoor spaces - but acknowledged that the public remain 'sceptical' about the benefits.People WON'T obey lockdown again: SAGE files reveal scientists warned UK Government to prepare for 'visible resistance' to future rule changes and show a THIRD of the public still don't know the symptoms of Covid-19•Behavioural experts warn of 'various responses' to future lockdown measures•People no longer fear the coronavirus as much and disagree with Government•Young people are sick of social distancing and are beginning to stop doing it•Other papers showed public toilets are considered a particular transmission risk•The virus may spread from person-to-person over 10 metres, but it is unlikelyThe Government has been warned to prepare for 'visible resistance' if it ever tries to introduce another lockdown to fight coronavirus in the future, official advice papers revealed today.Newly-released files from Number 10's Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (SAGE) show that top behavioural scientists fear people won't follow the draconian rules for a second time.They warned young people are tiring of social distancing and abandoning the rules, while disagreements about the UK's approach to Covid-19 mean the public will be less likely to follow advice in future.Public faith in the Government - which has faced a barrage of criticism for having Europe's worst death toll - has dropped since the start of the pandemic and people no longer have the same fear of the virus, the papers cautioned.The same document revealed that a staggering 35 per cent of people - more than a third - still don't know that coughing and a fever are the two tell-tale symptoms of Covid-19.Another paper revealed scientists consider public toilets to be one of the highest risk areas for catching the coronavirus. They say using them is riskier than touching door handles in public or using cash machines.And while being within two metres (6'7"") of someone presents the biggest risk of catching the virus, there is still a risk of it transmitting if someone is 10m (32') away, one report said. And a third advice paper said measuring the reproduction rate of the virus - the R - will not be useful now that the outbreak has shrunk, and definitely not on a regional level.The findings in SAGE papers published today include:•Behavioural scientists warned trying to reintroduce lockdown rules after lifting them 'might evoke various responses' because people disagree over whether they're necessary;•Many people 'lack a basic understanding of Covid-19' and only 65 per cent can identify the main symptoms, researchers said. They added that people are 'confused by rapidly changing government guidance and do not fully understand the rationale for it';•The coronavirus may be able to spread between people who are 10 metres (32 feet) apart, but the highest risk is when people are within 2m (6'7"") of others;•A huge study of 64,066 Covid-19 hospital patients in the UK found that 28 per cent of them died. Patients spent nine days in hospital, on average, and 16 per cent needed high-flow oxygen treatment;•Regional R rate comparisons are not an accurate way of measuring where hotspots are, and the national rate is only vague once case numbers have dropped. Officials may struggle to reimpose lockdown measures One of the key reports in today's batch of the papers, which are now released weekly as part of a transparency drive, was from the group SPI-B, which reports to SAGE.SPI-B, the Scientific Pandemic Influenza group on Behaviour, advises the Government about human behaviour and issues it might face dealing with people.The report, dated June and titled 'Consensus on reintroduction of measures and their impact on rate of infection', said: 'From a behavioural perspective, reintroduction of measures might evoke various responses from the population - silent compliance, critical compliance or visible resistance (eg. from marginalised groups, young people). 'Policy and communication need to take these different forms of response into account in order to be successful.'Several factors should be considered when deciding what measures to introduce and how to introduce them. These apply equally at a national level, and at a more local level.'The scientists started by saying many people were likely to change their own behaviour without being forced to do so, if told they were at risk of infection.They said these would be gradual changes rather than sudden ones and that enforcement might be needed to speed them up.The main concern they raised was that the 'psychological context' of any future lockdowns will be different to what it was in March, when the country was facing the unknown and thousands of people were catching the disease every day. SPI-B's report said: 'Disagreements about the appropriate response to the pandemic are likely to complicate any attempt to reimpose restrictions.'And it added: 'There has been an increase in resistance to social distancing measures in recent weeks... 'This is particularly pronounced in the case of certain demographics and communities which have borne the brunt of lockdown but in some cases are at less at risk, e.g. younger people.'However, the drivers of resistance transcend inter-generational and structural inequality and express a hierarchy of priorities which relegates Covid to other concerns such as the right to social interaction (free parties) and the right to protest (e.g. Black Lives Matter).'Many people 'lack a basic understanding of Covid-19' Despite the coronavirus dominating public life for the past four months behavioural scientists say many people still lack a basic understanding of the virus.Referring to a study by King's College London, SPI-B warned that only 65 per cent of people can correctly identify a cough and a fever as the main symptoms of Covid-19.                     PARTIES AND RAVES ARE 'EXACTLY WHAT WE DON'T WANT TO SEE', SAYS CHIEF MEDIC                     Dr Jenny Harries, the Government's chief medical officer for England, said earlier this week that she was worried about seeing parties and raves taking place across the country.As lockdown rules have eased photos and videos have emerged of hundreds of young people drinking and partying together in cities around the UK. Dr Harries said that everyone must continue to follow coronavirus advice on hand-washing and socialising, as well as sticking to social distancing.'The virus is still out there, it's looking for more people to infect and we need to stop it getting a grip,' she said. The chief medic told ITV's This Morning she was 'very, very concerned' about second wave of the virus, adding: 'I don't want to label young people because that would be very unfair, but actually if you do not have friends who have become very ill, for example, it perhaps hasn't registered quite as much how dangerous this virus can be and young people definitely are not as severely affected.'Raves worry me, as a public health doctor. That's exactly what we do not want to be happening.'The death rate definitely is coming down but effectively what we've seen is the first peak, and we want to prevent a second one.'Because the weather is slightly with us, it's quite likely that the summer is sort of running a bit in our favour.'In the warmer weather, particularly when people are outdoors much more - which is much safer - we're unlikely to see one.'But I think myself and colleagues are very, very concerned about looking out for a potential second peak as we move into the autumn.'And of course that's the same time that we start having people presenting with other symptoms which could confuse people - so flu symptoms vary, obviously, and also when our hospitals get busier.' This could affect the likelihood of infected people getting tested for the virus, and may also been people don't self-isolate when they should.The report said: 'Many people are confused by rapidly changing government guidance and do not fully understand the rationale for it, which makes it less likely that they will be intrinsically motivated to undertake and sufficiently skilled in implementing effective infection control.' Virus could spread 10 metres through air, and public toilets are medium risk A paper presented to SAGE by the expert group on the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in the wider environment (TWEG) on June 12 shone light on the most likely modes of the coronavirus spreading.The report maintained that the biggest risk for people is coming within 2metres (6'7"") of other people who might have the illness - not obeying social distancing.It is possible, they said, that droplets carrying the virus could transmit 10m (32') through the air.They ruled that the risk of this was 'very low' but they were not certain because of the quality of evidence backing it up. Using public toilets, meanwhile, posed a 'medium' risk for people's likelihood of catching Covid-19.TWEG's report ranked the risk higher than it did for touching door handles or cash machines in public places, and also higher than for swimming in public.It said: 'Public toilets represent a potential SARS-CoV-2 exposure point for a number of reasons.'Primary amongst these is that they contain many touch surfaces which could be contaminated with infective nasopharyngeal [throat] fluids or faecal material and to which many people are exposed in a short time period. 'Toilets also represent the point at which the amount of infectious virus might be greatest in waste water. Aerosol, faecal/ocular, and faecal/oral transmission risks have been hypothesised based on virus presence and evidence exists based on previous SARS-CoV outbreaks. 'In addition, toilets may be a contact hub point in the community where transmission can occur between users through face-to-face droplet transmission, in the toilet building itself, and in proximity.'More than a quarter of hospitalised UK Covid-19 patients die A study of 64,066 hospital patients with Covid-19 in the UK found that 28 per cent of them - more than one in four - die with the disease.Deaths were higher for people admitted to intensive care, of whom 35 per cent succumbed to the disease, and even higher for those who had to be put onto ventilators - 42 per cent.The COVID-19 Clinical Information Network (CO-CIN), comprised of university experts from around the UK, presented the results to SAGE from June 22.The study had found people spend an average of nine days in hospital if they are admitted with coronavirus, or catch it while on a ward.Some 16 per cent of patients require high-flow oxygen therapy to help them breathe.The most common symptoms for hospital patients are coughs (63 per cent), fever (62 per cent) and shortness of breath (61 per cent) - but a worrying one in 16 people (6 per cent) claimed to have had no symptoms at all, the study found.Measuring the R rate is no longer a useful measures - especially not at a regional levelAnother group that advises SAGE, SPI-M-O, issued caveats to its estimates of the R value of the coronavirus in the UK on June 12.SPI-M-O is the Scientific Pandemic Influenza Group on Modelling, Operational, and advises the Government on the possible trajectory of the outbreak.When giving its estimates of the R value - the reproduction rate of the coronavirus - it cautioned that the figures are not useful when there are small numbers of people testing positive.The R rate is currently between 0.7 and 0.9 for the UK as a whole, meaning that every 10 infected people pass the virus on to between seven and nine others, on average.But SPI-M-O warned: 'Estimates of R are less reliable and less useful in determining the state of the epidemic as cases decrease. There are three main reasons for this:'Firstly, when there are few cases, R is impossible to estimate with accuracy and will have wide confidence intervals that are likely to include 1. This does not necessarily mean that the epidemic is increasing but could be the result of greater uncertainty.'Secondly, as incidence decreases, R will tend towards 1, and has to be evaluated in conjunction with incidence. The policy implications of R = 1 when there are 1,000 new infections per day are very different to when there are 100,000 per day.'Finally, R is an average measure. When incidence is low, an outbreak in one place could result in estimates of R for the entire region to become higher than 1. Conversely, small, local outbreaks will not be detected. Estimates of R based on small numbers may also not capture change in the area fast enough to inform policy in a useful way.'The scientists said they were so unconvinced about the accuracy or usefulness of measuring the reproduction rate that it shouldn't be used for policy decisions such as imposing regional restrictions or lockdowns.They added: 'Estimates of R at regional levels are subject to the same difficulties in interpretation of national estimates, but amplified because of the smaller numbers of cases. 'Publishing large numbers of estimates increases the statistical chance that one of them is artificially high. SPI-M-O does not have confidence that regional R estimates are sufficiently robust to inform regional policy decisions.'",Web Publication

10,The risk of harm and the greater good,"June 27, 2020 Saturday",International,"Financial Times (London, England)",871,871,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,Tim Harford,The risk of harm and the greater good,"W hile the world celebrated the discovery that the steroid dexamethasone was an effective treatment for Covid-19 patients on ventilators, my physician friend was unimpressed. It was obvious that dexamethasone would work, she opined; intensive care units should have been using it as a matter of course.Perhaps. But that is what doctors thought about the use of similar steroids to treat patients with head injuries. Logically, steroids would be so effective that a clinical trial seemed unethical. Overcoming these objections, the Corticosteroid Randomization After Significant Head Injury trial put the steroids to the test - only to discover that, far from being lifesavers, they raised the risk of death. From steroids to social policy, what works and what doesn't is often surprising. That is why rigorous experiments in real-world settings are invaluable.This was the true contribution of the much-vaunted ""behavioural insight"" teams that became fashionable about a decade ago in the UK, US and elsewhere. Behavioural scientists have some useful ideas, but like doctors they are often wrong. More useful than any ""insight"" was the increased use of randomised trials in policymaking.It is surprising how far one can push the idea, as Ben Goldacre describes in the International Journal of Epidemiology. Should we have had a randomised trial, in the 1960s, of whether beating boys with canes discouraged them from smoking? The idea of caning children is repugnant today, and rightly so. But then it was commonplace - so it might have been worth checking if it worked as advertised. A non-randomised study was even conducted in 1962. But as Archie Cochrane, a pioneer of evidencebased medicine, wrote, ""when one thinks about it, the results do not tell us anything at all"".There are, of course, examples of randomised trials that clearly risked harm to the participants. One 1958 experiment lured 200 children into refrigerators rigged with internal video cameras; the idea was to watch what the children tried to do to escape. It is an unnerving study that distressed some children and for which no meaningful consent could have been obtained. On the other hand, it informed improvements in fridge safety that have plausibly saved several hundred lives.A modern parallel would be a trial that deliberately infected healthy volunteers with coronavirus to see whether there was a way to trigger an immune response with a low-risk dose. Exactly this idea was proposed to me in March by a senior adviser to the UK government, who grumbled that doctors refused to approve the scheme. Unlike the toddler-in-a-fridge study, informed consent would have been easy to obtain. But otherwise the ethics are similar: a clear risk of harm to the study group, with the greater good in mind.The idea is an old one; before we had a true vaccine for smallpox, people were ""variolated"" with a controlled exposure to the deadly virus. Variolation was truly dangerous, but broadly effective.Trials of caning, fridge-escapes and variolation worry us not because of the trial but because of what is being tested. But often experiments make us uneasy for no good reason. A recent study by Michelle Meyer and others described hypothetical cases to survey respondents and asked them if the behaviour was appropriate.Imagine, for example, a clinical director who tried to reduce hospital infections by putting up posters with a safety checklist for medical www.staff.No problem, right? Or imagine he or she instead puts the checklist on the back of the badges worn by doctors and nurses. Also, surely, no problem. Now imagine instead that they decide to run an experiment by randomly assigning people to be treated in a room with the poster, or by a doctor wearing the badge.When Ms Meyer and her colleagues described one of these scenarios, few people were concerned about either the poster or the badge, but a substantial minority who were told about the randomised experiment raised objections. It is unclear why we have this aversion to randomising between two unobjectionable alternatives. The most straightforward explanation is that people either object to the idea of being arbitrarily manipulated, or they are unnerved by the realisation that the clinical director doesn't know what he or she is doing.But while understandable, these are not good arguments against experimentation. If decision makers are fallible - which they are - then randomised trials are a solution to, not a symptom of, that problem. So researchers should work hard to demonstrate the trustworthiness of their experiments. Securing real consent is ethically invaluable, but it is also good public relations.And policymakers should embrace randomisation. Steroids were surprisingly effective in treating ventilated Covid-19 patients, and surprisingly harmful in the head injuries trial. There are plenty of policy interventions with a similar capacity to surprise. The equivalent of dexamethasone for crime, or early-years education, or tax compliance, may be out there. Randomised trials, however queasy they may make some of us feel, are a good way to find out.tim.harford@ft.comGiven that decision makers are fallible, randomised trials are a solution to the problem",Newspaper

Officials may struggle to reimpose lockdown measures One of the key reports in today's batch of the papers, which are now released weekly as part of a transparency drive, was from the group SPI-B, which reports to SAGE.SPI-B, the Scientific Pandemic Influenza group on Behaviour, advises the Government about human behaviour and issues it might face dealing with people.The report, dated June and titled 'Consensus on reintroduction of measures and their impact on rate of infection', said: 'From a behavioural perspective, reintroduction of measures might evoke various responses from the population - silent compliance, critical compliance or visible resistance (eg. from marginalised groups, young people). 'Policy and communication need to take these different forms of response into account in order to be successful.'Several factors should be considered when deciding what measures to introduce and how to introduce them. These apply equally at a national level, and at a more local level.'The scientists started by saying many people were likely to change their own behaviour without being forced to do so, if told they were at risk of infection.They said these would be gradual changes rather than sudden ones and that enforcement might be needed to speed them up.The main concern they raised was that the 'psychological context' of any future lockdowns will be different to what it was in March, when the country was facing the unknown and thousands of people were catching the disease every day. SPI-B's report said: 'Disagreements about the appropriate response to the pandemic are likely to complicate any attempt to reimpose restrictions.'And it added: 'There has been an increase in resistance to social distancing measures in recent weeks... 'This is particularly pronounced in the case of certain demographics and communities which have borne the brunt of lockdown but in some cases are at less at risk, e.g. younger people.'However, the drivers of resistance transcend inter-generational and structural inequality and express a hierarchy of priorities which relegates Covid to other concerns such as the right to social interaction (free parties) and the right to protest (e.g. Black Lives Matter).'Many people 'lack a basic understanding of Covid-19' Despite the coronavirus dominating public life for the past four months behavioural scientists say many people still lack a basic understanding of the virus.Referring to a study by King's College London, SPI-B warned that only 65 per cent of people can correctly identify a cough and a fever as the main symptoms of Covid-19.                     PARTIES AND RAVES ARE 'EXACTLY WHAT WE DON'T WANT TO SEE', SAYS CHIEF MEDIC                     Dr Jenny Harries, the Government's chief medical officer for England, said earlier this week that she was worried about seeing parties and raves taking place across the country.As lockdown rules have eased photos and videos have emerged of hundreds of young people drinking and partying together in cities around the UK. Dr Harries said that everyone must continue to follow coronavirus advice on hand-washing and socialising, as well as sticking to social distancing.'The virus is still out there, it's looking for more people to infect and we need to stop it getting a grip,' she said. The chief medic told ITV's This Morning she was 'very, very concerned' about second wave of the virus, adding: 'I don't want to label young people because that would be very unfair, but actually if you do not have friends who have become very ill, for example, it perhaps hasn't registered quite as much how dangerous this virus can be and young people definitely are not as severely affected.'Raves worry me, as a public health doctor. That's exactly what we do not want to be happening.'The death rate definitely is coming down but effectively what we've seen is the first peak, and we want to prevent a second one.'Because the weather is slightly with us, it's quite likely that the summer is sort of running a bit in our favour.'In the warmer weather, particularly when people are outdoors much more - which is much safer - we're unlikely to see one.'But I think myself and colleagues are very, very concerned about looking out for a potential second peak as we move into the autumn.'And of course that's the same time that we start having people presenting with other symptoms which could confuse people - so flu symptoms vary, obviously, and also when our hospitals get busier.' This could affect the likelihood of infected people getting tested for the virus, and may also been people don't self-isolate when they should.The report said: 'Many people are confused by rapidly changing government guidance and do not fully understand the rationale for it, which makes it less likely that they will be intrinsically motivated to undertake and sufficiently skilled in implementing effective infection control.' Virus could spread 10 metres through air, and public toilets are medium risk A paper presented to SAGE by the expert group on the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in the wider environment (TWEG) on June 12 shone light on the most likely modes of the coronavirus spreading.The report maintained that the biggest risk for people is coming within 2metres (6'7"") of other people who might have the illness - not obeying social distancing.It is possible, they said, that droplets carrying the virus could transmit 10m (32') through the air.They ruled that the risk of this was 'very low' but they were not certain because of the quality of evidence backing it up. Using public toilets, meanwhile, posed a 'medium' risk for people's likelihood of catching Covid-19.TWEG's report ranked the risk higher than it did for touching door handles or cash machines in public places, and also higher than for swimming in public.It said: 'Public toilets represent a potential SARS-CoV-2 exposure point for a number of reasons.'Primary amongst these is that they contain many touch surfaces which could be contaminated with infective nasopharyngeal [throat] fluids or faecal material and to which many people are exposed in a short time period. 'Toilets also represent the point at which the amount of infectious virus might be greatest in waste water. Aerosol, faecal/ocular, and faecal/oral transmission risks have been hypothesised based on virus presence and evidence exists based on previous SARS-CoV outbreaks. 'In addition, toilets may be a contact hub point in the community where transmission can occur between users through face-to-face droplet transmission, in the toilet building itself, and in proximity.'More than a quarter of hospitalised UK Covid-19 patients die A study of 64,066 hospital patients with Covid-19 in the UK found that 28 per cent of them - more than one in four - die with the disease.Deaths were higher for people admitted to intensive care, of whom 35 per cent succumbed to the disease, and even higher for those who had to be put onto ventilators - 42 per cent.The COVID-19 Clinical Information Network (CO-CIN), comprised of university experts from around the UK, presented the results to SAGE from June 22.The study had found people spend an average of nine days in hospital if they are admitted with coronavirus, or catch it while on a ward.Some 16 per cent of patients require high-flow oxygen therapy to help them breathe.The most common symptoms for hospital patients are coughs (63 per cent), fever (62 per cent) and shortness of breath (61 per cent) - but a worrying one in 16 people (6 per cent) claimed to have had no symptoms at all, the study found.Measuring the R rate is no longer a useful measures - especially not at a regional levelAnother group that advises SAGE, SPI-M-O, issued caveats to its estimates of the R value of the coronavirus in the UK on June 12.SPI-M-O is the Scientific Pandemic Influenza Group on Modelling, Operational, and advises the Government on the possible trajectory of the outbreak.When giving its estimates of the R value - the reproduction rate of the coronavirus - it cautioned that the figures are not useful when there are small numbers of people testing positive.The R rate is currently between 0.7 and 0.9 for the UK as a whole, meaning that every 10 infected people pass the virus on to between seven and nine others, on average.But SPI-M-O warned: 'Estimates of R are less reliable and less useful in determining the state of the epidemic as cases decrease. There are three main reasons for this:'Firstly, when there are few cases, R is impossible to estimate with accuracy and will have wide confidence intervals that are likely to include 1. This does not necessarily mean that the epidemic is increasing but could be the result of greater uncertainty.'Secondly, as incidence decreases, R will tend towards 1, and has to be evaluated in conjunction with incidence. The policy implications of R = 1 when there are 1,000 new infections per day are very different to when there are 100,000 per day.'Finally, R is an average measure. When incidence is low, an outbreak in one place could result in estimates of R for the entire region to become higher than 1. Conversely, small, local outbreaks will not be detected. Estimates of R based on small numbers may also not capture change in the area fast enough to inform policy in a useful way.'The scientists said they were so unconvinced about the accuracy or usefulness of measuring the reproduction rate that it shouldn't be used for policy decisions such as imposing regional restrictions or lockdowns.They added: 'Estimates of R at regional levels are subject to the same difficulties in interpretation of national estimates, but amplified because of the smaller numbers of cases. 'Publishing large numbers of estimates increases the statistical chance that one of them is artificially high. SPI-M-O does not have confidence that regional R estimates are sufficiently robust to inform regional policy decisions.'",Web Publication

So it is absolutely critical that people stick to the guidance that has been given.""It was a candid admission that behavioural issues are central to what happens next, and that the good sense of the population is all that stands between us and disaster. After all, the virus hasn't gone away, infection levels are roughly where they were shortly before lockdown, and if we return to business as usual we will rapidly waste all the sacrifices of the last three months.It was also a deeply ironic moment, given that this administration has systematically underestimated the resilience of the British public, invoked their lack of staying power to delay lockdown, and was then surprised at the extent to which people obeyed restrictions despite considerable hardship for many. In effect, the government now has to rely on those they dismissed in order to save their skin.But the problem is that the easing of lockdown measures announced by the government on Tuesday, which included a reduction of the 2-metre rule, endanger adherence to the remaining restrictions. People may have the willpower to endure hard times when they are convinced that it is necessary. But the evidence from past pandemics shows that they won't abide by restrictive rules if they think that the danger has gone away. And while Whitty might argue that this is a distorted version of the government's position, the problem is that actions can speak louder than words.Whatever the prime minister might say, his policies lead to banner headlines such as Freedom Pass and Independence Day. But we don't even need to read the papers. Every time we pass an open bar, it will scream to us that the danger is all but gone and we are ""back to normal"". After all, who in their right mind would reopen the pubs and abandon distancing in the midst of a deadly pandemic?But perhaps that is overstating things a little. After all, the government isn't abandoning all distancing measures. It is saying 1 metre is acceptable when 2 metres is impossible, as long as other measures are applied. True. However, research in the field of proxemics - the study of space and social interaction - shows that, in the UK, 1 metre is roughly the distance we ordinarily maintain with others. So reducing it to 1 metre is akin to removing any restrictions from distancing, and hence functions as another signal of back to normal.Moreover, even if 1 metre is the distance you start out at from someone, human bodies are not static. We draw in to those whom we see as alike, and to those we like. One metre quickly becomes half a metre. Limbs move. People touch. And, even before we start factoring in the use of alcohol, all semblance of restriction flies out of the window.As stressed in a paper by the new behavioural advisory group to Independent Sage, the 2 metre to 1 metre reduction and the other changes announced for 4 July won't only lead to an increased physical transmission of infection at a time when we are far from being out of the woods. They also undermine the psychological resolve we need to deal with the pandemic.But although we counselled against a change, the change has been made. So what should happen now? The first thing is to abandon the bombast and the unbalanced optimism of ""            sending the virus packing in 12 weeks "" and to be realistic about the situation we are in. It is a situation of considerable fragility and danger. We may have exchanged the blunt instrument of lockdown for the more targeted strategy of test, trace and isolate (rather prematurely perhaps when the testing system is far from fully functional) but that isn't an ""easing"" or a ""relaxation"". Rather it is a contract that, in return for lifting some restrictions, requires greater adherence in other ways.Second, we need a massive effort to ramp up the testing system and drive down rates of infection. This is not just about logistics: it is also about understanding the barriers to adherence at every level, from acknowledging your symptoms early, getting tested and revealing all your contacts, to fully self-isolating if contacted. And to achieve that, we need to involve all sections of the community in developing the system and to deliver it through local systems they know and trust.Third, we need to provide the material support to those we are asking to self-isolate at a time when everyone else is going out. This goes way beyond a vague promise that no one should be disadvantaged. It means bold and imaginative schemes involving all sections of society - government, business and local communities - to provide positive incentives to those who isolate themselves for the good of society.In sum, it isn't enough to express a fond hope that people will stick to guidance. It is now more necessary than ever to apply our understandings of human behaviour in order to provide the motivation, the information and practical resources for people to do the right thing. Then, despite government policies, the public may (not for the first time) come to the rescue of our country's response to Covid-19.

Downing Street has been repeatedly criticised for being too slow to ramp up testing, imposing lockdown too late and abandoning contact tracing too early. Britain has Europe's worst Covid-19 death toll, with official figures showing almost 43,000 people have died after testing positive for the virus, and more detailed stats putting an extra 10,000 on top of that.Professor Reicher - based at the University of St Andrews - attacked Number 10's response, arguing they should have listened to behavioural scientists more. Such experts have taken flak in the crisis after ministers cited 'behavioural science evidence' for not imposing lockdown sooner.Health Secretary Matt Hancock said people 'tire' of social distancing measures, 'so if we start them too early, they lose their effect and actually it is worse'. Professor Reicher's comments were in a response to a column in The Times, which argued listening to behavioural experts was one of 'the biggest mistakes'.Author Martha Gill wrote they 'led the government directly to a fatal delay in imposing lockdown', which was finally introduced on March 23.Ms Gill called for behavioural scientists to be ditched 'altogether', accusing them of being 'lobbyists for their own brand of thinking'. Professor Reicher said 'the vast majority' of experts disagreed with the idea of crisis fatigue and clashed over it with ministers.He added that SPI-B - the SAGE sub-committee he sits on - 'vigorously opposed the notion of fatigue... or its use to argue against restrictions'.In a lengthy Twitter thread criticising The Times piece, he argued the government 'desperately needs guidance on behavioural science'.[related][item name=video id=4435230 style=2 /]Professor Reicher said: 'They have got things disastrously wrong and they should have listened more to their independent behavioural science advisors.'Everything we can do to contain the pandemic, from washing your hands to getting tested to self isolating, has a behavioural dimension. WHEN DID OTHER COUNTRIES GO INTO LOCKDOWN AND HOW MANY PEOPLE HAVE DIED IN THEM?   An report published in March by the Imperial College COVID-19 Response Team outlined the dates on which various countries in Europe started their lockdown measures. The numbers on their own do not suggest a direct link between the timing of lockdown and the number of people who died, showing that other factors come into play. The most comparable countries in size to the UK are France, Germany, Italy and Spain. •Austria: March 16•Belgium: March 18•Denmark: March 18•France: March 17•Germany: March 22•Italy: March 11•Norway: March 24•Spain: March 14•Sweden: No lockdown•Switzerland: March 18•United Kingdom: March 23'So how do we get the public on board with these things? How do we create a sense of community and mutual responsibility? How do we gain trust? 'These aren't arcane academic discussions any more. They are matters of life and death. And there are clear evidence-based suggestions on how to address them.'He added: 'By arguing they should be ignored, you undermine the efforts against the pandemic.'And Professor Reicher said there was an important point raised, asking: 'Is one view of human behaviour overly dominating in No 10 and has it led to bad decisions?'He also said that 'people are resilient, that they can cope with tough times if given adequate information and adequate support'. Professor Reicher has previously attacked the government over its handling of the Dominic Cummings saga, warning people would die because of his decision to travel 260miles to his parents' house during lockdown. Scores of scientists have echoed Ms Gill's lockdown argument, saying thousands of lives could have been saved had it been implemented sooner. Even 'Professor Lockdown' - Imperial College London's Neil Ferguson - said 25,000 deaths could have been avoided if it was imposed one week earlier.Mr Johnson imposed lockdown on the back of the Imperial's grim modelling, which predicted 500,000 people could die if the virus was left unchecked.Another SAGE member, Sir Ian Boyd, argued last month it 'would have made quite a big difference' if ministers acted sooner to curb the outbreak. And a mathematician at Southampton University claimed introducing lockdown on March 16 could have kept the death toll to around 11,000. Polls of Brits show around two thirds of people think the government took too long to put the UK in lockdown.But other experts say ministers 'lost sight' of the evidence and rushed into lockdown, praising Sweden for holding its nerve and not shutting down the economy. A TIMELINE OF THE UK'S COVID-19 LOCKDOWN   February 28: Virus started spreading uncontrollably in Britain, according to the World Health Organization. March 3: Government and NHS officially launched campaign urging people to wash their hands more often.March 12: Anyone who developed a fever or a new cough, regardless of whether they got tested for COVID-19, was told to self-isolate for two weeks. March 16: Social distancing begins: •Public were told to avoid contact with people outside of their homes, to work from home where possible, and to only take essential travel, such as to and from work or medical appointments.•Pubs and restaurants are not forced to close but people are encouraged to avoid them.•Likewise, the Government refused to ban large gatherings and sports events but said police and ambulances would no longer be provided for them.March 20: Major businesses were ordered to close immediately, including gyms, leisure centres, pubs, cafes, restaurants, theatres and cinemas.March 23: Full lockdown introduced:•In a speech to the nation Prime Minister Boris Johnson urged everyone to stay at home unless necessary, only leaving to shop, to go to medical appointments or to exercise once per day.•Gatherings of people were banned, regardless of size, and people prohibited from mixing with others outside of their household.•Everyone was told to work from home if possible.

Professor Stephen Reicher hit out after the PM claimed Dominic Cummings' 260-mile drive from London to Durham in late March followed ""every father's instinct"".The expert said the row had undermined the pledge that ""we're all in this together"" -and that will affect people's willingness to follow lockdown.""There's a very clear sense now that there are different rules, that we're divided, and that government is looking after themselves in a way they're not looking after us,"" he told the Mirror.""The problem is of course that if adherence falls, the infection will rise and people will die.""Full lockdown was in place at the time of Mr Cummings' trip to Durham -with people only able to leave home for basic shopping, one exercise a day, a medical need or for work where necessary.On March 23 Mr Johnson said: ""That's all -these are the only reasons you should leave your home. You should not be meeting family members who do not live in your home."" Anyone with coronavirus symptoms -which Mr Cummings' wife had -was told to stay at home especially firmly to keep others safe. Yet last night the Prime Minister claimed Mr Cummings had ""no alternative"", because he feared his young son would not be cared for if both he and his wife fell ill.While there are exceptions for caring for a child, deputy chief medical officer Jenny Harries suggested this would apply when there is ""extreme risk to life"".And by No10's own admission, Mr Cummings -who stayed in a property near his sister and nieces -did not yet have symptoms when his family drove to Durham.He also cared for his child without family help, other than bringing shopping to the door.No10 has tried to defend Mr Cummings by saying he isolated in the property for 14 days. But government advice at the time, and now, was clear that people should not travel to second homes even for isolation, and should not stay overnight away from their ""primary residence"".A chorus of scientific advisors to the government hit out last night, with Prof Reicher claiming Boris Johnson had ""trashed"" his own advice to stay home.Today Prof Reicher, a member of the Scientific Pandemic Influenza Group on Behaviours SPI-B, claimed the mixed messaging would cost lives.Lockdown is still in place with only a few restrictions being lifted in England. People are still banned from visiting second or holiday homes, even for isolation.Prof Reicher told ITV's Good Morning Britain: ""The real issue here is that because of these actions, because of undermining trust in the Government, because of undermining adherence to the rules that we all need to follow, people are going to die.""More people are going to die.""Prof Reicher also told the Mirror: ""If you want people to adhere to what authorities say, if you want people to trust authorities and trust government, then one of the most important factors... is accents of 'they are acting with us and for us'.""It's the sense that 'we're all in this together' that leads people to make those sacrifices which are necessary for us all to survive.""The best way to undermine that... is the sense there's one rule for them and one rule for us.""What you're immediately doing is you're dividing us into a 'them and us' -and that's what is being done.""There's a very clear sense now that there are different rules and that we're divided and that government is looking after themselves in a way they're not looking after us.""The problem is of course that if adherence falls, the infection will rise and people will die.""He stopped short of saying what the PM or Mr Cummings should do now, saying: ""I'm not a politician and I don't want to make political judgements.""He declined to say whether SPI-B members would be making formal representations to the government.Prof Reicher rejected suggestions by Mr Cummings' allies that he and other critics were part of a ""left-wing plot"" against the aide.He said while he campaigned for equality and against Apartheid he was not a member of any political party, adding: ""For me this has got nothing to do with politics. I am there to help this government. Whatever I think of this government they're the only government we've got and therefore our role must be to help them get us out of this mess.""But he warned: ""They've got to be prepared to listen to us.""",Newspaper; Web Publication
17,"Cummings' actions show government cannot be trusted, says adviser;Sage scientist condemns 'vacuum in the heart of government'Coronavirus - latest updatesSee all our coronavirus coverage","May 25, 2020 Monday",International,The Guardian (London),752,752,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,Sarah Boseley,"Cummings' actions show government cannot be trusted, says adviserSage scientist condemns 'vacuum in the heart of government'Coronavirus - latest updatesSee all our coronavirus coverage","A leading scientist from the government's official advisory body has said there is a ""vacuum in the heart of government"" following Dominic Cummings' press conference on breaking lockdown, and that ""we now have to recognise that central government probably cannot be trusted to provide leadership.""Robert West, a professor of health psychology at University College London's Institute of Epidemiology and Health, who sits on the advisory group on behavioural science for Sage told the Guardian: ""From a public health perspective what we now have to recognise is that central government probably cannot be trusted to provide leadership, and other agencies, including local and regional government, are going to have to work together to make up for this. It will be difficult and maybe things will change but as things stand there is a leadership vacuum in the heart of government.""In reference to Cummings' account of why he drove hundreds of miles to Durham during lockdown, West said: ""There are so many holes in his narrative that only the most desperate people who want to believe him could do so. Not least is the idea that someone who is not an idiot would drive for 30 miles (coincidentally to a tourist attraction) with his wife and child in the car to check that he was safe to drive.""""It may sound odd but I really wanted him to find a credible and honourable way out of this mess,"" said West. ""But the whole thing is playing out like a Greek tragedy with the protagonists trapped by their own proclivities to self-destruct - in his case by his hubris and inability to say sorry.""West also said there had been growing unease among his advisory colleagues about a divergence between the scientific advice and the government's approach. ""Those of us on Spi-B have been increasingly concerned about the extent to which the government's approach to the behavioural sciences and the messaging, particularly, has been at 180 degrees from the kind of advice that we have been sending into the Cabinet Office,"" said West. Members of Spi-B, the advisory group on behavioural science, say their recommendations to set very clear and unequivocal messages for the public to follow have frequently been ignored by politicians. They fear Cummings' apparent disregard of the rules will be extremely damaging.He noted that ministers got a lot of flak for changing the advisory slogan from ""stay at home"" to ""stay alert"" as they began to talk of easing the lockdown. ""And rightly so, because it is exactly the kind of thing that you would have hoped they would have consulted with their scientific advisers on, in order to come up with something that would be meaningful at a really important stage of the process.""West said Spi-B was never asked about the change of slogan. ""The sense is that there's another parallel group of people who are effectively calling the shots here and have their own views on how things should go, but they are not necessarily experts in communication or behavioural science or all the things they would need to be.""They are treating the whole health crisis as though it were a political crisis. If it's a political crisis, what you do is try to manage your reputation. If it's a health crisis you focus on saving lives, at whatever cost to your political reputation.""He said 40 people were involved in Spi-B, the Independent Scientific Pandemic Influenza Group on Behaviours, which feeds in to Sage, the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies.""I know [concern] is widespread among the group but not everybody feels comfortable speaking out and I completely understand that. But there has been considerable and growing unease,"" West said. ""The worry is that the government has said from the beginning it is following the science, and that was never true.""The group did not expect to be calling the shots, he said, ""but when the government forms policy or does something that goes against the advice, they need to explain why"".He said the Cabinet Office asked the committee to provide guidance and write papers to answer questions posed by the government, sometimes at two hours' notice. The members were working extremely hard, he said. ""Then it seems to go into a black hole and we see communications that are at variance [with the advice].""He expressed sympathy for Chris Whitty and Patrick Vallance, the chief medical officer for England and the chief scientific officer, who he said were ""potentially in such a difficult position"" attempting to champion the science with the government.",Newspaper

Or to use David Cameron's description of Mr Cummings: ""A career psychopath""; the type of maverick adviser who didn't seem to give much thought to the consequences of travelling to Durham during lockdown despite his omnipotent role at the heart of government.If you want to know why Mr Johnson cannot bring himself to dispense with Mr Cummings, then it is summed up in two simple words, uttered by the Durham-born father of one as he was confronted by the press outside his London home on Saturday.When asked by reporters whether his actions looked bad, he replied: ""Who cares?"" before adding: ""It's not about what you guys think.""Because for the PM, the complete opposite is true. He cares deeply what people think of him. Unlike Mr Cummings, he is not only eminently likeable but also needs to be liked.As one former aide put it: ""Boris is actually quite sensitive. He can't stand losing people not just because he worries people know things, but also because he just doesn't like losing people from the circle around him, people he trusts. This whole thing will have been consuming him the entire weekend, which is what makes it so problematic - it's such a distraction. The next three-week lockdown review is due on Thursday and No10 are dealing with all this nonsense.""Yet with further revelations expected today, why not simply cut Mr Cummings loose? Loyalty has played a huge part in Mr Johnson's decision to keep Mr Cummings on. It is not an exaggeration to say that the PM feels he owes his premiership to the 48-year-old Oxford graduate. It was Mr Cummings who helped to win the EU referendum, who helped to rescue Brexit from the clutches of Remain rebels, who helped to suck Labour into triggering the general election, and who helped to win Mr Johnson an 80-seat majority.He sold himself to the PM on the premise he could get things done - not just Brexit and reform of the civil service but delivery of Mr Johnson's revolutionary legacy. Like him or loathe him, no one can fault Mr Cummings's work ethic and commitment to the www.cause.No wonder then, that Mr Johnson Continued on Page 3 Continued from Page 1 effectively over because this makes it unenforceable.""Stephen Reicher, a member of the SPI-B committee that advises the Government on behavioural science, said: ""In a few short minutes tonight, Boris Johnson has trashed all the advice we have given on how to build trust and secure adherence to the measures necessary to control Covid-19."" Susan Michie and Robert West, both members of SPI-B, tweeted they agreed. Tory MPs shared messages on a WhatsApp group that had been sent to them by angry constituents demanding to know why they had been forced to miss funerals or important events if the rules were open to interpretation.Steve Baker, the former Brexit minister, said it was an ""insult"" to people who had diligently obeyed the lockdown rules. Peter Bone said the ""vast, vast majority"" of Conservative MPs now wanted Mr Cummings out of No10.Mr Johnson said he decided to ap-pear at the briefing because people were asking: ""Is this Government asking you, the public, to do one thing while senior people here in Government…have been basically flouting those rules and endangering lives?"" He said the answer was: ""I believe that in every respect, [Mr Cummings] has acted responsibly and legally and with integrity, and with the overwhelming aim of stopping the spread of the virus and saving lives.""Sir Keir Starmer, the Labour leader, said: ""This was a test of the Prime Minister and he has failed it. The public will be forgiven for thinking there is one rule for the Prime Minister's closest adviser and another for the British people. The Prime Minister's actions have undermined confidence in his own public health message at this crucial time. Millions were watching for answers and they got nothing.""He said Sir Mark Sedwill, the Cabinet Secretary, should launch an ""urgent inquiry"" into the affair.Five unanswered questions What did the Prime Minister know about Dominic Cummings' trip to Durham and was he informed of the police investigating the matter? Did Mr Cummings visit Barnard Castle, 30 miles from Durham, on April 12? Did Mr Cummings visit Houghall Woods near his family's Durham April 19? Why could Mr Cummings not arrange childcare in London?

20,The problem with 'shielding' people from coronavirus? It's almost impossible;Testing and tracing is the answer to protecting our most vulnerable - not trying in vain to 'cocoon' them away Coronavirus - latest updatesSee all our coronavirus coverage,"May 29, 2020 Friday",International,The Guardian (London),1259,1259,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,Devi Sridhar and Yasmin Rafiei,The problem with 'shielding' people from coronavirus? It's almost impossibleTesting and tracing is the answer to protecting our most vulnerable - not trying in vain to 'cocoon' them away Coronavirus - latest updatesSee all our coronavirus coverage,"In the last UK government report on coronavirus policy, the word ""shielding"" is mentioned 36 times. The UK, Sweden and the Netherlands have all shown much interest in this strategy of cocooning vulnerable groups in their homes or shelters while attempting to reopen economies outside.To date, shielding has meant asking those who are clinically extremely vulnerable to coronavirus not to leave home, to avoid any face-to-face interaction, and to restrict human contact to the digital realm. What goes unsaid is that this strategy of shielding is distinctly western, and has not proven particularly effective at protecting these individuals. The first vocal proponent of shielding was Boris Johnson, who announced           in mid-March that the UK would keep its economy open and achieve ""herd immunity"". In the meantime, those at high risk of coronavirus would need to protect themselves by shielding from the rest of society. David Halpern, the chief executive of the behavioural insights team, which is part-owned by the government, said, ""            there's going to be a point, assuming the epidemic flows and grows, as we think it probably will do, where you'll want to cocoon, you'll want to protect those at-risk groups so that they basically don't catch the disease - and by the time they come out of their cocooning, herd immunity's been achieved in the rest of the population"". This plan turned out to be disastrous. Deaths ravaged care homes and households, and the UK quickly reversed tack and introduced a national lockdown on 23 March. The UK now has one of the            highest death tolls in the world. Yet shielding strategies stuck: governments in the US, UK, Sweden and other western countries still advise confinement for vulnerable populations. Most (with the exception of Sweden) recommend shielding in conjunction with a national lockdown.In contrast, east Asian governments have adopted policies focused almost exclusively on mass testing, tracing, and isolation of infectious individuals. In South Korea and            Taiwan, governments made two face masks a week available to citizens and registered non-citizens across the country. The core objective in these countries was to drive the virus out and prevent both young and old people catching it.Two key assumptions underlie shielding use in the UK. First, that if 15% of the population, say, were vulnerable to severe infection from coronavirus, this group could reasonably be isolated from the remaining 85%, who were likely to contract only a mild illness. And second, that those who have contracted coronavirus would develop protective immunity. Yet we still don't know if people develop immunity once they have become infected with coronavirus.And in practice, the first assumption falls apart. According to one study in China, 80% of coronavirus transmissions occurred at home, where multi-generational living complicates attempts at shielding. Elderly people who are shielding and living with family members under one roof are especially at risk as countries move to reopen their economies. This risk shouldn't be understated. In the US,             13 million  Americans over 65 live in multigenerational households. Some don't have the space for their own room. For members of this group who are clinically extremely vulnerable, shielding isn't really an option.Even elderly people who live alone need regular contact for care and services. According to the Institute on Aging in the US,  65% of older adults rely exclusively on family and friends to provide them with assistance. Another 30% receive paid assistance alongside their family support. Every point of contact in the network of care for an elderly person who is shielding increases their threat of infection.Beyond immediate family and friends, people who are shielding are also more likely to need regular contact to receive medical care, grocery deliveries, and transportation. The extent to which at-risk populations must rely on others for essential care and services is a huge challenge to the efficacy of any shielding strategy.We've seen that despite attempts to shield           people in nursing and care homes, death rates in these places are consistently among the highest in national tolls. Consider Sweden, which remains lockdown-free, despite deaths ravaging its care homes and elder-care services. At least 50% of the country's coronavirus deaths occurred within nursing homes,             according to  Anders Tegnell, the chief epidemiologist of the Swedish public health agency. In the UK, where a national shielding strategy was temporarily adopted, care homes also became hotbeds for infection. Care home deaths were found to be higher than 22,000 by academics at the London School of Economics. Inefficacies aside, shielding itself is harmful to the mental health of those who are vulnerable. Older adults are already at heightened risk of depression and  suicidal thoughts; according to the Kaiser Family Foundation, social isolation from shielding can            exacerbate these mental health challenges. It's unlikely that the mental health of members of this group who have to shield will improve from being asked to shield indefinitely. And the elderly alone don't bear the risks of coronavirus. Many younger individuals live with key risk factors that put them into vulnerable groups, and some will be deemed clinically extremely vulnerable to coronavirus. Earlier this month, the world's largest patient study  by the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and Oxford University found that key factors relating to coronavirus deaths included uncontrolled diabetes, severe asthma, obesity, poverty and            ethnic minority status.As western countries ease lockdown, suggestions have been made for those being shielded to stay ""cocooned"" away indefinitely until a vaccine or antiviral therapy is found or natural herd immunity is reached. What we suggest instead is a general strategy of suppression, where governments make a commitment to keeping daily new cases as low as possible through an active testing-and-tracing programme and real-time monitoring of transmission.At the same time, the government should advise those in ""shielded groups"" about their individual risk, as well as provide them with data about transmission within their communities, and then leave these individuals to make an informed decision about how and when they would like to engage in society.For a government to pursue shielding alone, with its proven inefficacies and intrinsic harms, would be nothing but an Orwellian strategy - one that presides over the fates of those at greatest risk, against all evidence. There are serious ethical and moral questions around building a society where the healthy and young are left to circulate, and the elderly, the disabled and the vulnerable are hidden away.  Prof Devi Sridhar is chair of global public health at the University of Edinburgh; Yasmin Rafiei is a research assistant at the University of Edinburgh This article was amended on 1 and 4 June 2020. It originally stated that shielding has meant asking the elderly, chronically ill, and others vulnerable to hospitalisation from coronavirus not to leave home; in fact shielding applies to those who are ""clinically extremely vulnerable"". In addition, the behavioural insights team is not part of the government as an earlier version said, although it is part-owned by the Cabinet Office. And the same team did not develop the ""herd immunity"" plan, as was previously suggested.",Newspaper

Trashed. Respect the public, we said. Trashed. Ensure equity, so everyone is treated the same, we said. Trashed. Be consistent we said. Trashed. Make clear 'we are all in it together'.

PM and Cummings should do likewise.""Johnson's unexpected appearance at the press briefing on Sunday - his first in nearly two weeks - was seen by his own MPs as an attempt to protect Cummings following revelations that the adviser had broken the lockdown rules he had helped to write.Johnson did not respond to a series of detailed questions including whether Cummings stopped during the four-hour journey and whether the prime minister had known of Cummings's trip at the time.Senior Tory MPs said that the prime minister's decision to attend the press conference and his inability to answer detailed questions will fuel the furore and will damage his premiership. ""The PM is losing his instinct, he might be losing the plot and we could lose the country over this virus,"" said one.Reacting to the prime minister's comments, Sir Roger Gale MP said it was an ""extraordinary position"" for Johnson to take. ""It's up to the prime minister to exercise judgment about who he has around him,"" he told BBC Radio 5 Live.Tim Montgomerie, a former Johnson adviser, tweeted : ""Tonight, I'm really embarrassed to have ever backed Boris Johnson for high office.""MPs including the former minister and 1922 Committee member, Steve Baker, and the chair of the Northern Ireland select committee, Simon Hoare, said Cummings should step aside to stop further damage to the government.Hoare said : ""With the damage Mr Cummings is doing to the government's reputation, he must consider his position. Lockdown has had its challenges for everyone.""It's his cavalier 'I don't care; I'm cleverer than you' tone that infuriates people. He is now wounding the PM/Govt & I don't like that.""Anger and dismay was also expressed by Church of England bishops on Twitter after the prime minister's press conference. The Rt Revd Nick Baines, bishop of Leeds, said: ""The question now is: do we accept being lied to, patronised and treated by a PM as mugs? The moral question is not for Cummings - it is for PM and ministers/MPs who find this behaviour acceptable.""What are we to teach our children? (I ask as a responsible father.)""A few minutes earlier, the Rt Revd Dr Helen-Ann Hartley, bishop of Ripon, wrote: ""Integrity, trust and leadership were never there; just a driven misguided ideology of power that has total disregard for the most weak and vulnerable, and those who work to protect and care for us with relatively low pay.""Following the press conference, Starmer said: ""This was a test of the prime minister and he has failed it. It is an insult to sacrifices made by the British people that Boris Johnson has chosen to take no action against Dominic Cummings. The public will be forgiven for thinking there is one rule for the prime minister's closest adviser and another for the British people.""The prime minister's actions have undermined confidence in his own public health message at this crucial time. Millions were watching for answers and they got nothing. That's why the cabinet secretary must now launch an urgent inquiry.""Leaving Downing Street after about six hours in No 10 on Sunday, Cummings refused to answer questions. Earlier, police officers had visited his north London home in response to media gathering outside.A jogger reported that he saw Cummings on 19 April, five days after Downing Street says he returned to London from Durham and did not return.Ministers had denied reports in the Guardian and Daily Mirror that Cummings was seen looking at bluebells in woods near Houghall, close to his family's property on the outskirts of Durham, that day.Our source stood by their claim and Tim Matthews, a runner, has since come forward to claim he saw Cummings later that day. Matthews tweeted a link to a route from the running app Strava that he had dubbed ""Brick Run aka Dominic Cummings Spotting Run"".It marks the area where he saw Cummings at 3.45pm on 19 April. He tweeted: ""Here's my two potential sightings Riverbanks and Houghall Woods - I've been banging on about them ever since.""Meanwhile Cummings is facing a possible police investigation under health laws over a claim that he breached self-isolation rules by allegedly visiting Barnard Castle on 12 April. Lees made a complaint by email to police on Sunday after reporting that he saw Cummings and his family walking in the town before getting into a car.The alleged sighting of Cummings in the town appeared to come while he was still ill, according to his own account. Writing in the Spectator last month, Cummings said: ""At the end of March and for the first two weeks of April I was ill, so we [Cummings and his wife] were both shut in together.""Johnson did not dispute that his adviser had made a trip to the Tees Valley beauty spot. Asked directly about the visit, the prime minister said: ""When you look at the guidance, when you look at the particular childcare needs that Mr Cummings faced at the time, it was reasonable of him to self-isolate as he did for 14 days or more with his family where he did.

But infection rates are still high in hospitals and care homes and SAGE papers suggest that up to 25 per cent of more patients are catching the virus inside hospitals.Scientific advice put to the Government in SAGE papers revealed: •Only around 50 per cent of people will actually self-isolate for a week if they have coronavirus symptoms;•Regional lockdowns could increase tensions and risk violence, much of it directed at the police;•Face masks are beneficial and scientists told officials two weeks before the public was given the advice;•Test and trace will not be enough to stop the virus spreading - social distancing must carry on until the coronavirus can be eradicated;•Up to 25 per cent of hospital patients diagnosed with the coronavirus caught it while they were being cared for;•A policy of 'social bubbles' could have encouraged the spread of the virus by opening the door to 'excessive' social networking.Regional lockdowns could trigger violence Imposing lockdowns on a region-by-region basis wouldn't work and could lead to a rise in attacks on the police, scientists warned. Health Secretary Matt Hancock confirmed this week measures may be imposed on whole towns, if there are regional flare-ups of coronavirus cases.But ministers were warned enforcing rules on certain regions 'would not be suitable' for the UK - despite its apparent success in China.In one of the SAGE papers, two security experts said doing so may 'undermine the consensus that has been built on the need for restrictive measures'.Professor Clifford Stott, a social psychologist at Keele University, and another author whose name was redacted said enforcing lockdowns on a region-by-region basis may 'lead to significant issue of disorder'.Allowing sub-sets of the population to live normally 'undermines' the sense of 'we are all in this together' spirit, the pair said. They added: 'Geographical division of a large urban area in the UK will inevitably intersect with ethnic and socio-economic boundaries. 'Those in lower socio-economic positions are more susceptible to the virus and therefore lockdown will be more likely in areas of poverty relative to wealth. 'Anger arising from communities who perceive they have been locked down unfairly would be directed at police in the majority of cases. This is particularly problematic in areas... whose populations traditionally have more difficult historical relations with police and could easily lead to escalations.'[item name=video id=4379220 style=2 /][related]Restrictions imposed in the UK so far have yet to lead to any conflict because they have been perceived as fair, the experts said. They added: 'Any sense of inequality... would likely lead to civil disorder and feed the propaganda of extremist groups and hostile states. 'Households may also fear retaliation if cases within a neighbourhood prevent release and may conceal cases as a result.' 'Not enough is being done' to protect the vulnerable Scientists raised concerns last month that not enough was being done to protect people most at risk of dying of Covid-19 and called for separate tiers of protections.In a SAGE paper dated April 27, one of its sub-groups, SPI-M, raised concerns that the most at-risk groups of people were not being protected well enough.It suggested that lockdown rules should not be loosened in a blanket fashion but should be designed to 'de-couple' outbreaks in the community and vulnerable places like care homes.Experts in the group said: 'SPI-M remains concerned that not enough is being done to protect those who are known to be at high risk of death if infected with COVID-19.'The people at highest risk of dying if they catch Covid-19 are the very elderly and those with serious long-term health problems such as dementia, or people whose immune systems or lungs don't function properly, such as cancer or transplant patients.Those people are still being urged to 'shield' themselves by the Government - to avoid leaving home or having visitors - even as lockdown releases around them.SPI-M's paper suggested they may have to abide by social distancing rules for longer than other younger, lower risk sections of society, even if case numbers were low.The statement added: 'A low incidence scenario would still require risk-based variation in social distancing measures and careful shielding of parts of the population, although this would not need be as aggressive or have as high adherence rates necessary for a high incidence scenario.' Hairdressers and nail bars are high riskHairdressers and nail bars could be coronavirus hot-spots, ministers were warned at the start of May.Scientists feeding into SAGE claimed personal care businesses 'could have levels of infection as high as those seen in social care'.And the Scientific Pandemic Influenza Group on Modelling group warned it may lead to an increase in Covid-19 transmission in the community. Mr Hancock yesterday said hairdressers will not reopen in the next fortnight, despite salons saying they are ready to open their doors in June.The Health Secretary - who revealed his wife cuts his locks - would not commit to hairdressers being allowed to open their doors again on June 15. In Europe salons are open already with everyone forced to wear masks, including customers, and dry cuts, magazines, hot drinks and even long chats banned. Social distancing must stay until vaccine or cure is found Social distancing cannot go away until the coronavirus can be wiped out, vaccinated against or cured, top scientists say. Government advisers regularly remind the public social distancing is 'here to stay' but SAGE documents ram home how indispensable it is in the long term.WHAT WAS DISCUSSED IN THE FIRST SAGE MEETING?   WHEN WAS IT HELD? January 22 in Westminster - Britain recorded its first confirmed cases of coronavirus nine days later. WHICH SCIENTISTS ATTENDED?•Sir Patrick Vallance, Chief Scientific Adviser•Professor Chris Whitty, Chief Medical Officer for England•Charlotte Watts, Chief Scientific Adviser, Department for International Development•Professor Jonathan Van Tam, Deputy Chief Medical Officer for England•Carole Mundell, Chief Scientific Adviser, Foreign and Commenwealth Office•Cathy Roth, Department for International Development•Phil Blythe, Chief Scientific Adviser, Department for Transport•Pasi Penttinen, European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control•Maria Zambon, Public Health England•Jim McMenamin, Health Protection Scotland•Christine Middlemiss, Chief Veterinary Office, DEFRA•Professor Neil Ferguson, Imperial•Professor Peter Horby, Oxford•Professor David Lalloo, LSHTM•Sir Jeremy Farrar, Wellcome Trust•Dr Ben Killingley, UCL•Professor John Edmunds, LSTHM•Dr James Rubin, King's CollegeWHAT WAS THEIR UNDERSTANDING ABOUT THE VIRUS AT THE TIME? There is evidence of person-to-person transmission.The incubation period appears to be within five to 10 days.It is 'highly probable' the reproductive number is currently above one.The mortality rate for WN-CoV appears to be lower than for SARS.No evidence to prove individuals are infectious prior to showing symptoms. WHAT DID EXPERTS RECOMMEND AT THE TIME? NERVTAG did not advise port of entry screening, despite not knowing much about the virus.It also didn't advise the use of screening questionnaires or requiring proof of exit screening at Wuhan.SAGE said it would review its position on port screening only if a simple, specific and rapid test was available.Temperature screening was unlikely to be of value and have high false positive and false negative rates, it said. DID THEY DISCUSS GETTING A TEST READY? The UK currently has good centralised testing capacity for Covid-19, which had yet to be named at the time, the experts claimed at the meeting.And they claimed they were days away from having a specific test, which they said was scalable across the UK within weeks.They warned of 'conflicting reports' of the accuracy of test samples taken from the upper respiratory tract, such as the nose and mouth.SAGE agreed that only people who had symptoms and had returned from Wuhan in the past fortnight should be tested.Even a highly effective test and trace system which has 100 per cent compliance from the public would not be enough to keep the R below 1 on its own, SAGE was warned.The SPI-M group said that people must make long-term reductions to the number of people they meet up with outside of work and change how they do so.In papers submitted in April and May the group warned: 'Case isolation, household quarantine and app-based tracing, even with very high uptake levels, without some level of social distancing will not be sufficient to keep R below 1 on their own.'It added: 'Even with contact tracing in place, there will need to be sustained, deep reductions in contacts outside work and schools to keep the reproduction number below 1.'Keeping the R below 1 is crucial for preventing a second wave.The group said trying to restrict social distancing only to specific groups, such as the over-45s, would require 'unrealistic' proportions of people to agree to it. Applying it to everyone would see benefits with a lower level of compliance.Rules expected to continue in the long-term could include keeping distance from other people (currently 2m/6'6') and not having physical contact with people from outside your household.The strictness of these would depend on the number of coronavirus cases being diagnosed in the population. Herd immunity could develop in a year but thousands would die One of the only ways to get rid of distancing measures without a vaccine or cure would be to try and develop herd immunity SAGE was told, but tens of thousands of people would die.Herd immunity, in which so many people catch a virus that it struggles to spread any more, could work if it turns out people are unable to catch the illness twice.For a brief period at the start of the outbreak the Government had considered trying to slow down the virus but let it keep going so that herd immunity would develop, but there was massive public backlash when it emerged thousands would die as a result.In a paper submitted to SAGE in April, SPI-M said: 'Maintaining a high incidence scenario [large number of infections] could allow measures to be progressively relaxed as population immunity developed.'It would, however, take around one year to allow all measures to be removed using such an approach, even if all infections resulted in an effective, long-lasting immune response.'Such a policy would result in tens of thousands of direct deaths from COVID-19 and it is unlikely that significant levels of population immunity could be achieved by autumn without ICU [intensive care units] being overwhelmed.' Up to 25% of Covid-19 hospital patients catch virus during treatmentUp to a quarter of Covid-19 who need medical treatment caught the virus in hospital, government advisers warned.And SPI-M told ministers the figure - compiled from 'several sources' - suggested this figure was 'highly likely' to be an under-estimate. Scientists revealed their estimate, submitted on April 20, did not include people who acquire infection in hospital, leave and are then readmitted. They called for an 'urgent investigation' into the true burden of healthcare-acquired infections.And the experts suggested using some hospitals solely to treat Covid-19 patients, to reduce the rate of healthcare-acquired infections. Their estimate took into account data from provided to the Department of Health on a weekly basis, as well as Public Health England figures.It comes amid claims 40 per cent of staff at a Weston-super-Mare hospital that shut to new patients over a spike in Covid-19 have tested positive for the infection.Separate studies have suggested up to three per cent of NHS medics on coronavirus front-line unknowingly had the virus in April.It raised the possibility that NHS workers were spreading the disease to vulnerable patients without knowing, treating them while infectious. Opening pubs, restaurants and schools would speed up viral spread Scientists cannot say how lifting lockdown will affect the speed at which the virus is spreading but fear reopening pubs, restaurants and schools would allow it to spiral.SPI-M warned in a paper on April 1 that the more time people spend indoors with one another, the more likely it is that a second wave of coronavirus would emerge.The Government, as it releases lockdown restrictions, is desperate to keep the virus's reproduction rate - the R - below 1, to make sure patients don't infect any more than one other person each.Lockdown has pushed the R to somewhere between 0.7 and 0.9 but releasing the rules too soon will allow it to spiral again.SPI-M said: 'Relaxing rules of the use of outdoor spaces, including working outdoors, is highly unlikely to make a significant direct difference to infection rates, as long as social distancing continues to be followed in this environment.'There is limited evidence on the effect of closing of non-essential retail, libraries, bars, restaurants, etc., but it is likely that R would return to above 1 and a subsequent exponential growth in cases.'They said that allowing people outdoor exercise and supermarket shopping were likely to have little effect on the R rate.And large gatherings are also unlikely to boost an outbreak because they account for so few of people's personal contacts because they are attended infrequently. But encouraging people to return to offices instead of working from home would likely have 'the largest effect' on the reproduction rate.Fully reopening schools back to normal would also have a significant effect, the scientists said: 'Lifting any of the other measures in place, including school closures are almost certain to return R to above 1'.However, SPI-M admitted that it was difficult to assess the true impact of different lockdown measures on the speed the virus spreads.The group added: 'Measures have been introduced simultaneously or in quick succession, so their individual effects cannot be disentangled; self-imposed population behaviours may also complicate the picture.'Terrorists could attack large gatherings while police short-staffed Terrorists could carry out an attack on British soil while police forces are distracted by a lack of crime, experts warned.In evidence submitted to ministers on May 4, behavioural scientists claimed it was 'an opportunity' for the UK to be rocked by an attack.SPI-B claimed violent extremist organisations may launch an attack 'as a means of signalling to the public that a group or issue has not gone away'. The group also warned that permitting protests - currently restricted because of the Covid-19 crisis - could also be exploited by terrorists.They said: 'Lifting restrictions on assembly will permit protests against the economic effects of the lockdown, which will become more visible as time wears on. 'It is at points such as this that one could expect exploitation by violent extremist organisations and intersection with protests in other countries as a result of emulation/common purpose or trans-European activism.' In a separate paper, government advisers said data showed 999 calls for the police have dropped up to 75 per cent in some areas.Experts said the trend suggests the lockdown has led to major reductions in crime across Britain, perhaps due to a 'lack of opportunity'. But they revealed there has been a spike in calls to the police for certain offences, such as domestic violence. Social bubbles could lead to 'excessive networks' and risk spreadAllowing people to meet in bubbles could have enabled coronavirus to spread through the population, scientists suggested. It was thought the roadmap to easing the lockdown contained the possibility one household could form a social 'bubble' with one other in a mutual group. However as people are set to start meeting up outdoors in groups of up to six from Monday, there has been no mention of bubbles. And Downing Street has warned the public that socially-distanced, six-people meet-ups remain prohibited in England until Monday. Minutes from a SAGE meeting on May 7 disclosed what the experts had to say on the issue of bubbles. They said that while the concepts of bubbles has potential benefits for wellbeing and mental health, there were also risks if they were to be introduced alongside other changes, or if there is poor adherence. The minutes said: 'The effects of bubbles are complex. Introducing bubbles alongside other changes could reconstruct excessive networks, particularly when combined with any increase in contacts in other settings.'These networks could enable transmission through the population. It will be difficult to assess the effects of individual policy changes on R if multiple changes are introduced together.' SAGE added: 'A safe approach to bubbles would need to include isolation of all members of a bubble in the case of one member showing symptoms. 'This would lead to increased frequency of isolation for people, particularly in winter months.'Face masks are protective when people can't social distance Scientists concluded there was enough evidence to recommend the use of face coverings weeks before ministers issued the advice.Experts said on April 21 that the public should be advised to wear coverings when social distancing is not possible, but ministers in England did not issue the advice until May 11. The SAGE panel, including chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance and chief medical officer for England, Professor Chris Whitty, discussed masks on April 21. 'SAGE advises that, on balance, there is enough evidence to support recommendation of community use of cloth face masks, for short periods in enclosed spaces, where social distancing is not possible,' they concluded. Despite Scotland and Northern Ireland issuing the advice to wear coverings, ministers in England did not give the guidance until publishing the 'plan to rebuild' nearly three weeks later. 'As more people return to work, there will be more movement outside people's immediate household,' they said. 'This increased mobility means the Government is now advising that people should aim to wear a face-covering in enclosed spaces where social distancing is not always possible, and they come into contact with others that they do not normally meet, for example on public transport or in some shops.' Only HALF of people with coronavirus symptoms self-isolate Only about half of people with coronavirus symptoms self-isolate for an entire week, behavioural experts told SAGE.The discovery raised concerns over whether future outbreaks can be prevented. The disclosure of low compliance with a key rule in suppressing Covid-19 comes days before the lockdown is eased, with people being asked to isolate for 14 days even if they do not have symptoms. Under the NHS test and trace programme, people in England will be told to quarantine themselves for two weeks if they come into contact with someone who has tested positive. A document shows behavioural experts warning: 'We strongly recommend monitoring and rapid research into adherence rates to all key behaviours and how to improve them, noting that based on DHSC tracker only around 50 per cent of people are currently reporting self-isolating for at least seven days when symptomatic with cough or fever.'Their warning came on April 29 and an updated figure was not immediately available, but now people across the UK are beginning to be allowed to meet up outside, at a distance, and shops are starting to reopen. Masks could make people 'falsely reassured' and ignorant of rules Wearing a face mask could give someone a false sense of security that encourages them to flout other social distancing rules, SAGE was warned.The Government declined for weeks to advise that people wear face masks, saying they were best reserved for medical workers. But it now encourages people to use coverings - not medical grade masks - if they are in indoor spaces where social distancing is difficult, such as in busy shops or on public transport.A document from SPI-B presented in April said: 'There are a number of issues, risks and potentially harmful behaviours associated with recommending or mandating use of facemasks which could reduce their effectiveness.'It said people might use them incorrectly or touch them, contaminating their hands, or make homemade masks that are 'ineffective.The group also warned: 'People may feel falsely reassured by wearing facemasks and so pay less attention to other behaviours that reduce viral transmission e.g. wash their hands less, do not adhere to social distancing measures.'90 per cent of care homes could experience outbreaks Scientists said in April that 'current trends' suggested 90 per cent of all care homes could suffer from outbreaks of Covid-19.The SPI-M group said in a statement on April 20: 'There is evidence in continued growth in the number of care homes which have experienced cases of COVID-19.'Any estimates of the proportion of care homes which will eventually experience outbreaks is highly speculative at this stage, but a figure approaching 90 per cent cannot be ruled out if current trends are maintained.'The statement came shortly the peak of the outbreak before a focus had really shifted on to care homes and testing was not widely available for staff or residents.More than 11,000 people are now known to have died in care homes. The proportion of homes that have had outbreaks is not clear, but bosses in the sector estimated it was around two thirds in April, while the Government's estimate was considerably lower. Russia 'is watching and gathering intelligence'SAGE was warned by SPI-B that Russia would be watching the attempts to set up a track and trace system and mobile app in a bid to find ways to gather data. They said: 'From an external security perspective, Russia will scrutinise all Western responses to Covid-19 as a significant intelligence gathering opportunity. 'Responses to CV19 allow it to monitor different countries' response measures, timings and effectiveness in a wartime-like scenario. 'In particular they will examine planning and capabilities in response to a civil contingency/peacetime threat. 'There will consequently be interest in how effectively the UK can mount a contact tracing campaign as well as attempts to exploit whatever deficiencies or public concerns there may be with it.'",Web Publication

A letter signed by 26 senior scientists and experts, delivered to 10 Downing Street on Friday, warns the government of losing public trust in the 'messages and messengers' of epidemic control. 'This trust had been badly damaged by the actions of Dominic Cummings, including his failure to stand down or resign in the public interest, and Boris Johnson's subsequent unwillingness to remove him,' the letter, reported in The Observer, reads. The letter, which has been signed by the president of the Faculty of Public Health and the director of the centre for public health at Queen Mary University, goes on to explain how 'high compliance' is necessary to stop a second wave of the virus. They also called for transparency on the NHS Track and Trace scheme, fearing the 'fragile mood' of the public after two months lockdown. The letter added the 26 scientists are 'very concerned for the safety and wellbeing of the general public' The Deputy Medical Chief Officer Professor Van-Tam said he believed Cummings should have stuck to the rules during yesterday's press briefing, making him the most senior government figure to criticise the chief advisor since his movements were made public last week. 'In my opinion the rules are clear and they have always been clear. In my opinion they are for the benefit of all. In my opinion they apply to all', he said. A poll by the Observer showed that 81 per cent of the public believe Cummings broke lockdown rules in the three trips. Another 68 per cent felt he should resign over the matter and more than half of those identified as Conservative.One of the letter's signatories, Professor David McCoy, director of the centre for public health at Queen Mary University, said that May should have been spent finessing the Test and Trace system. The government, he said, were focussed on other matters, one of which was the fallout from the Cummings scandal. 'Firstly he breached the lockdown rules but also as the chief adviser to the prime minister he has to take some responsibility for the failure of the government to make a proper response to Covid,' he told the Observer. The Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (SAGE) released a raft of documents yesterday in a drive for transparency, including the minutes of 34 of their meetings since they began convening on coronavirus in January. Much of the information included detailed minutes on expert warnings about relaxing lockdown prematurely. The dangers ranged from region-by-region lockdowns prompting a rise in attacks against police, to thousands of uneccessary deaths before herd immunity kicks in.                      The letter in full                     We are in a public health crisis unprecedented in living memory. We have written to the prime minister because we are very concerned for the safety and wellbeing of the public. There is ample evidence that effective epidemic control requires the public to trust and respect both the messages and the messengers who are advocating action. This trust has been badly damaged by the actions of Dominic Cummings, including his failure to stand down or resign in the public interest, and Boris Johnson's subsequent unwillingness to remove him.As lockdown is eased, public trust and high compliance is essential to reduce the risk of a second spike in infections and deaths. It is vital for all people in positions of power to follow the rules with the same discipline as the rest of the population. The public also needs to see that the necessary infrastructure and effective systems are put in place rapidly and effectively.A national track and trace scheme is a major undertaking. This makes it even more crucial that there is complete transparency about likely time scales and the risks associated with the strategy and plan. The public mood is fragile and unlikely to cope with another over-optimistic target-based strategy that goes on to fail. We are also concerned that the needs of people primarily affected by non-Covid-19 diseases are being neglected. For example, since the pandemic hit, there has been a 70% or more reduction in cancer diagnoses and there is an estimated backlog of 100,000 undiagnosed or untreated cancer cases (growing by about 5,000 a week). Similar backlogs are evident in every non-communicable disease.This exceptional situation also requires urgent and detailed planning and investment. We ask that the prime minister better harness the expertise in the NHS, social care, local authorities, academic institutions and the civil service to strengthen the response to Covid-19 and its knock-on effects on other health and care provision. We would be happy to assist in mobilising an effective strategic and operational response. Regional lockdowns could trigger violence                      How is the lockdown being eased in England from Monday?                    What's changing?From Monday, people can meet outside in groups of up to six as long as those from different households continue to socially distance. - Can I visit family and friends?Yes . This means that family groups of no more than six can meet in parks and private gardens for chats and even barbecues.- How far am I allowed to travel?There are no mileage limits set for how far you are allowed to drive to visit family and friends in England, Northern Ireland and Scotland, but the general advice is to remain in your local area as much as possible.However, people in Wales will still not be allowed to travel more than five miles from their home for any reason except work or to purchase essentials.Great, can we hug?Sadly no. You still cannot risk infection by being too close. The same goes for handshakes or kissing.If young children from different households are part of the group, they must not share paddling pools, climbing frames, slides or anything that would encourage them to be closer than two metres to each other.  Can I stay overnight?Staying overnight at someone else's home will still not be allowed anywhere in the UK, while even going indoors for any other reason than to access a garden or use the bathroom is prohibited.However Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has advised that if the distance travelled to meet someone means that you have to use their bathroom, then 'perhaps you shouldn't be doing it'. Can we barbecue?Yes, but you must wash your hands, be careful about passing food or plates and keep 6ft apart.How about entering their house?Only if there is no other way of getting to the back of the property. What about using the toilet?You can, but you must thoroughly clean any surfaces you touch.To be extra safe, you could even use a paper towel to open and close bathroom doors and perhaps consider using a kitchen roll to dry hands rather than a towel.So what if it rains?You will have to stand under an umbrella or leave. You cannot shelter in someone else's home.Can we camp in the garden?No, Boris Johnson said he did not want you to stay overnight.Do I only have to see the same group?No, you can meet different people at different times, but try not to see too many in quick succession.Can those shielding take part?No, they must continue to shield if they're in the clinically extremely vulnerable group and have had a letter from their GP.What about the over-70s?If they are not in the shielding group.We are a family of six - can we meet anyone else?No. The guidelines say you can meet only up to six people at any one time.Can we visit a relative in a care home garden?It would depend on circumstances and the care home's management.- What else will I be allowed to do under the new measures?In England, Monday's lockdown easing will signal the reopening of schools to allow students in nurseries, early-years settings, and Reception, Year 1 and Year 6 to return to class.Some shops are also set to reopen, with outdoor retail and car showrooms able to resume operations. - When might restrictions be eased further?Boris Johnson has flagged that more restrictions will be eased on June 15, beginning with the reopening of other non-essential retail shops such as fashion or homeware retail.Other businesses, such as pubs, hairdressers and cinemas will have to wait until July before they can reopen, the Government has previously said.- And what's the timeline elsewhere in the UK?In Scotland, there is no set timeline as for when more measures might be lifted. The government's lockdown roadmap stipulates that a number of conditions must be met before any further action is taken, including evidence that the country's Covid-19 transmission is successfully under control.Wales' First Minister Mark Drakeford is expected to announce on Friday that further plans on lifting restrictions will be unveiled in the coming weeks.Pending the country's rate of transmission remaining below one, a host of further restrictions are set to be eased in Northern Ireland on June 8, including the reopening of outdoor sports facilities, car showrooms and some non-essential retail stores.Outdoor weddings with a maximum of 10 people are also set to be allowed and hotels will be able to start taking forward bookings at their own risk.Imposing lockdowns on a region-by-region basis wouldn't work and could lead to a rise in attacks on the police, scientists warned. Health Secretary Matt Hancock confirmed this week measures may be imposed on whole towns, if there are regional flare-ups of coronavirus cases.But ministers were warned enforcing rules on certain regions 'would not be suitable' for the UK - despite its apparent success in China.In one of the SAGE papers, two security experts said doing so may 'undermine the consensus that has been built on the need for restrictive measures'.Professor Clifford Stott, a social psychologist at Keele University, and another author whose name was redacted said enforcing lockdowns on a region-by-region basis may 'lead to significant issue of disorder'.Allowing sub-sets of the population to live normally 'undermines' the sense of 'we are all in this together' spirit, the pair said. They added: 'Geographical division of a large urban area in the UK will inevitably intersect with ethnic and socio-economic boundaries. 'Those in lower socio-economic positions are more susceptible to the virus and therefore lockdown will be more likely in areas of poverty relative to wealth. 'Anger arising from communities who perceive they have been locked down unfairly would be directed at police in the majority of cases.

Applying it to everyone would see benefits with a lower level of compliance.Rules expected to continue in the long-term could include keeping distance from other people (currently 2m/6'6') and not having physical contact with people from outside your household.The strictness of these would depend on the number of coronavirus cases being diagnosed in the population. --------------------------------------------------------- Herd immunity could develop in a year but thousands would die One of the only ways to get rid of distancing measures without a vaccine or cure would be to try and develop herd immunity SAGE was told, but tens of thousands of people would die.Herd immunity, in which so many people catch a virus that it struggles to spread any more, could work if it turns out people are unable to catch the illness twice.For a brief period at the start of the outbreak the Government had considered trying to slow down the virus but let it keep going so that herd immunity would develop, but there was massive public backlash when it emerged thousands would die as a result.In a paper submitted to SAGE in April, SPI-M said: 'Maintaining a high incidence scenario [large number of infections] could allow measures to be progressively relaxed as population immunity developed.'It would, however, take around one year to allow all measures to be removed using such an approach, even if all infections resulted in an effective, long-lasting immune response.'Such a policy would result in tens of thousands of direct deaths from COVID-19 and it is unlikely that significant levels of population immunity could be achieved by autumn without ICU [intensive care units] being overwhelmed.' Up to 25% of Covid-19 hospital patients catch virus during treatmentUp to a quarter of Covid-19 who need medical treatment caught the virus in hospital, government advisers warned.And SPI-M told ministers the figure - compiled from 'several sources' - suggested this figure was 'highly likely' to be an under-estimate. Scientists revealed their estimate, submitted on April 20, did not include people who acquire infection in hospital, leave and are then readmitted. They called for an 'urgent investigation' into the true burden of healthcare-acquired infections.And the experts suggested using some hospitals solely to treat Covid-19 patients, to reduce the rate of healthcare-acquired infections. Their estimate took into account data from provided to the Department of Health on a weekly basis, as well as Public Health England figures.It comes amid claims 40 per cent of staff at a Weston-super-Mare hospital that shut to new patients over a spike in Covid-19 have tested positive for the infection.Separate studies have suggested up to three per cent of NHS medics on coronavirus front-line unknowingly had the virus in April.It raised the possibility that NHS workers were spreading the disease to vulnerable patients without knowing, treating them while infectious. Opening pubs, restaurants and schools would speed up viral spread Scientists cannot say how lifting lockdown will affect the speed at which the virus is spreading but fear reopening pubs, restaurants and schools would allow it to spiral.SPI-M warned in a paper on April 1 that the more time people spend indoors with one another, the more likely it is that a second wave of coronavirus would emerge.The Government, as it releases lockdown restrictions, is desperate to keep the virus's reproduction rate - the R - below 1, to make sure patients don't infect any more than one other person each.Lockdown has pushed the R to somewhere between 0.7 and 0.9 but releasing the rules too soon will allow it to spiral again.SPI-M said: 'Relaxing rules of the use of outdoor spaces, including working outdoors, is highly unlikely to make a significant direct difference to infection rates, as long as social distancing continues to be followed in this environment.'There is limited evidence on the effect of closing of non-essential retail, libraries, bars, restaurants, etc., but it is likely that R would return to above 1 and a subsequent exponential growth in cases.'They said that allowing people outdoor exercise and supermarket shopping were likely to have little effect on the R rate.And large gatherings are also unlikely to boost an outbreak because they account for so few of people's personal contacts because they are attended infrequently. But encouraging people to return to offices instead of working from home would likely have 'the largest effect' on the reproduction rate.Fully reopening schools back to normal would also have a significant effect, the scientists said: 'Lifting any of the other measures in place, including school closures are almost certain to return R to above 1'.However, SPI-M admitted that it was difficult to assess the true impact of different lockdown measures on the speed the virus spreads.The group added: 'Measures have been introduced simultaneously or in quick succession, so their individual effects cannot be disentangled; self-imposed population behaviours may also complicate the picture.'Terrorists could attack large gatherings while police short-staffed Terrorists could carry out an attack on British soil while police forces are distracted by a lack of crime, experts warned.In evidence submitted to ministers on May 4, behavioural scientists claimed it was 'an opportunity' for the UK to be rocked by an attack.SPI-B claimed violent extremist organisations may launch an attack 'as a means of signalling to the public that a group or issue has not gone away'. The group also warned that permitting protests - currently restricted because of the Covid-19 crisis - could also be exploited by terrorists.They said: 'Lifting restrictions on assembly will permit protests against the economic effects of the lockdown, which will become more visible as time wears on. 'It is at points such as this that one could expect exploitation by violent extremist organisations and intersection with protests in other countries as a result of emulation/common purpose or trans-European activism.' In a separate paper, government advisers said data showed 999 calls for the police have dropped up to 75 per cent in some areas.Experts said the trend suggests the lockdown has led to major reductions in crime across Britain, perhaps due to a 'lack of opportunity'. But they revealed there has been a spike in calls to the police for certain offences, such as domestic violence. Social bubbles could lead to 'excessive networks' and risk spreadAllowing people to meet in bubbles could have enabled coronavirus to spread through the population, scientists suggested. It was thought the roadmap to easing the lockdown contained the possibility one household could form a social 'bubble' with one other in a mutual group. However as people are set to start meeting up outdoors in groups of up to six from Monday, there has been no mention of bubbles. And Downing Street has warned the public that socially-distanced, six-people meet-ups remain prohibited in England until Monday. Minutes from a SAGE meeting on May 7 disclosed what the experts had to say on the issue of bubbles. They said that while the concepts of bubbles has potential benefits for wellbeing and mental health, there were also risks if they were to be introduced alongside other changes, or if there is poor adherence. The minutes said: 'The effects of bubbles are complex. Introducing bubbles alongside other changes could reconstruct excessive networks, particularly when combined with any increase in contacts in other settings.'These networks could enable transmission through the population. It will be difficult to assess the effects of individual policy changes on R if multiple changes are introduced together.' SAGE added: 'A safe approach to bubbles would need to include isolation of all members of a bubble in the case of one member showing symptoms. 'This would lead to increased frequency of isolation for people, particularly in winter months.'Face masks are protective when people can't social distance Scientists concluded there was enough evidence to recommend the use of face coverings weeks before ministers issued the advice.Experts said on April 21 that the public should be advised to wear coverings when social distancing is not possible, but ministers in England did not issue the advice until May 11. The SAGE panel, including chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance and chief medical officer for England, Professor Chris Whitty, discussed masks on April 21. 'SAGE advises that, on balance, there is enough evidence to support recommendation of community use of cloth face masks, for short periods in enclosed spaces, where social distancing is not possible,' they concluded. Despite Scotland and Northern Ireland issuing the advice to wear coverings, ministers in England did not give the guidance until publishing the 'plan to rebuild' nearly three weeks later. 'As more people return to work, there will be more movement outside people's immediate household,' they said. 'This increased mobility means the Government is now advising that people should aim to wear a face-covering in enclosed spaces where social distancing is not always possible, and they come into contact with others that they do not normally meet, for example on public transport or in some shops.' Only HALF of people with coronavirus symptoms self-isolate Only about half of people with coronavirus symptoms self-isolate for an entire week, behavioural experts told SAGE.The discovery raised concerns over whether future outbreaks can be prevented. The disclosure of low compliance with a key rule in suppressing Covid-19 comes days before the lockdown is eased, with people being asked to isolate for 14 days even if they do not have symptoms. Under the NHS test and trace programme, people in England will be told to quarantine themselves for two weeks if they come into contact with someone who has tested positive. A document shows behavioural experts warning: 'We strongly recommend monitoring and rapid research into adherence rates to all key behaviours and how to improve them, noting that based on DHSC tracker only around 50 per cent of people are currently reporting self-isolating for at least seven days when symptomatic with cough or fever.'Their warning came on April 29 and an updated figure was not immediately available, but now people across the UK are beginning to be allowed to meet up outside, at a distance, and shops are starting to reopen. Masks could make people 'falsely reassured' and ignorant of rules Wearing a face mask could give someone a false sense of security that encourages them to flout other social distancing rules, SAGE was warned.The Government declined for weeks to advise that people wear face masks, saying they were best reserved for medical workers. But it now encourages people to use coverings - not medical grade masks - if they are in indoor spaces where social distancing is difficult, such as in busy shops or on public transport.A document from SPI-B presented in April said: 'There are a number of issues, risks and potentially harmful behaviours associated with recommending or mandating use of facemasks which could reduce their effectiveness.'It said people might use them incorrectly or touch them, contaminating their hands, or make homemade masks that are 'ineffective.The group also warned: 'People may feel falsely reassured by wearing facemasks and so pay less attention to other behaviours that reduce viral transmission e.g. wash their hands less, do not adhere to social distancing measures.'90 per cent of care homes could experience outbreaks Scientists said in April that 'current trends' suggested 90 per cent of all care homes could suffer from outbreaks of Covid-19.The SPI-M group said in a statement on April 20: 'There is evidence in continued growth in the number of care homes which have experienced cases of COVID-19.'Any estimates of the proportion of care homes which will eventually experience outbreaks is highly speculative at this stage, but a figure approaching 90 per cent cannot be ruled out if current trends are maintained.'The statement came shortly the peak of the outbreak before a focus had really shifted on to care homes and testing was not widely available for staff or residents.More than 11,000 people are now known to have died in care homes. The proportion of homes that have had outbreaks is not clear, but bosses in the sector estimated it was around two thirds in April, while the Government's estimate was considerably lower. Russia 'is watching and gathering intelligence'SAGE was warned by SPI-B that Russia would be watching the attempts to set up a track and trace system and mobile app in a bid to find ways to gather data. They said: 'From an external security perspective, Russia will scrutinise all Western responses to Covid-19 as a significant intelligence gathering opportunity. 'Responses to CV19 allow it to monitor different countries' response measures, timings and effectiveness in a wartime-like scenario. 'In particular they will examine planning and capabilities in response to a civil contingency/peacetime threat. 'There will consequently be interest in how effectively the UK can mount a contact tracing campaign as well as attempts to exploit whatever deficiencies or public concerns there may be with it.' We are in a public health crisis unprecedented in living memory. We have written to the prime minister because we are very concerned for the safety and wellbeing of the public. There is ample evidence that effective epidemic control requires the public to trust and respect both the messages and the messengers who are advocating action. This trust has been badly damaged by the actions of Dominic Cummings, including his failure to stand down or resign in the public interest, and Boris Johnson's subsequent unwillingness to remove him.As lockdown is eased, public trust and high compliance is essential to reduce the risk of a second spike in infections and deaths. It is vital for all people in positions of power to follow the rules with the same discipline as the rest of the population. The public also needs to see that the necessary infrastructure and effective systems are put in place rapidly and effectively.A national track and trace scheme is a major undertaking. This makes it even more crucial that there is complete transparency about likely time scales and the risks associated with the strategy and plan. The public mood is fragile and unlikely to cope with another over-optimistic target-based strategy that goes on to fail. We are also concerned that the needs of people primarily affected by non-Covid-19 diseases are being neglected. For example, since the pandemic hit, there has been a 70% or more reduction in cancer diagnoses and there is an estimated backlog of 100,000 undiagnosed or untreated cancer cases (growing by about 5,000 a week). Similar backlogs are evident in every non-communicable disease.This exceptional situation also requires urgent and detailed planning and investment. We ask that the prime minister better harness the expertise in the NHS, social care, local authorities, academic institutions and the civil service to strengthen the response to Covid-19 and its knock-on effects on other health and care provision. We would be happy to assist in mobilising an effective strategic and operational response. ",Web Publication
25,"Coronavirus: 'Many unnecessary deaths' risked by lifting lockdown before contact tracing system effective, scientists warn;Warning comes as minister warns tracker app may not be ready until winter","June 18, 2020 Thursday",International,The Independent (United Kingdom),843,843,England & Wales,Andrew Woodcock,"Coronavirus: 'Many unnecessary deaths' risked by lifting lockdown before contact tracing system effective, scientists warnWarning comes as minister warns tracker app may not be ready until winter","The government is risking ""many unnecessary deaths"" by lifting lockdown before an effective system is in place to track coronavirus sufferers, an influential group of scientists has warned.The Independent Sage group said that the NHS Test and Trace system introduced by Boris Johnson is ""not fit for purpose"".The experts also warned that the prime minister's current programme of relaxation of restrictions is ""premature"" while evidence suggests that the Covid-19 pandemic is still growing in some parts of the country and a resurgence of the disease is being reported in China, Germany and South Korea.The group, chaired by former government chief scientific adviser Sir David King, demanded the publication of the scientific basis for the current operation, which relies on a centralised system outsourced to private contractors. Numbers released last week showed that the NHS Test and Trace operation obtained contact details from just 5,407 people in a week when Office for National Statistics (ONS) figures suggested that there were at least 23,000 new symptomatic cases.In an interim report last week, Independent Sage warned that it would be ""impossible"" using this system to reach the 80 per cent of contacts necessary to bring the disease under control.The group proposed an alternative drawing on local council and NHS expertise and including support with food and finances and employment guarantees for all those asked to self-isolate for 14 days. Today, they called for additional support for black, Asian and minority ethnic (Bame) communities which have been particularly hard hit and have been difficult to reach under previous tracing efforts.Their final report was released as health minister, Lord Bethell, revealed that the NHSX smartphone app to identify contacts of coronavirus patients, once presented as an integral part of the government's test, track and trace strategy, may not now be available until the winter.Meanwhile, eight members of the SPI-B committee, which reports to the government's Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), announced that they are joining an Independent Sage behavioural science sub-group in order to be able to ""speak up on issues of importance that we believe are being ignored"".Independent Sage's final report noted ""worrying evidence shows that the pandemic is still growing in some parts of the country"".And it said: ""We argue that the current government approach to what is called test and trace is severely constrained by lack of co-ordination, lack of trust, lack of evidence of utility, and centralisation, such that achieving the goal of isolating 80 per cent of close contacts is impossible.""Sir David King said: ""This is a critical moment for the country in its fight against Covid-19. As we see new outbreaks in countries with significantly less infection than us it is self-evident that a fully functional test and trace system is essential to the next phase.""It is quite clear that the UK system is not yet fit for purpose, and indeed we have grave concerns that with the current approach it will never be so.""In this climate to continue to relax lockdown measures as we are seeing is foolhardy at best and risks significant further spikes with many unnecessary deaths.""We are therefore calling on the government to share the scientific evidence that these decisions have been based on so that we can properly assess the decisions made and continue to work towards a common goal of ending this awful pandemic as quickly as possible.""The report warned that ""the public's decreasing confidence in the government's management of the pandemic"" and ""inaccurate and excessive claims about the functionality of the system and the numbers being tested"" are undermining the test and trace system further.                     Stephen Reicher, professor of social psychology at the University of St Andrews, a member of the government's SPI-B panel who has joined the independent behavioural science group, said: ""All the measures we have to combat Covid-19 depend upon public buy-in - whether that be staying at home, keeping social distance, maintaining hygiene or supporting track and trace.""So understanding the barriers to adherence amongst different sections of the population, creating a sense of community and building trust must all be at the heart of an effective response to the pandemic. The new Behavioural Advisory Group will ensure that these issues are fully integrated into the work of Independent Sage.""Prof Reicher said the new group's work would be ""entirely complementary"" with the advice some of its members are already giving to the official Sage and to the Scottish chief medical officer.""Whereas in the official groups we are largely responding to questions raised by government, in Independent Sage we are free to speak up on issues of importance that we believe are being ignored or which need greater prominence,"" he said. ""Whether inside or outside the system, our primary aim is to give government the advice it needs to guide us through this unprecedented crisis.""",Newspaper; Web Publication
26,Easing Lockdown;The opening of non-essential shops is a small marker in recovery from the crisis,"June 15, 2020 Monday",International,The Times (London),566,566,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,,Easing LockdownThe opening of non-essential shops is a small marker in recovery from the crisis,"Figures last week showed that the economy contracted by more than 20 per cent in April, the first full month of lockdown. It is highly unlikely that the damage will swiftly be made good by the government's decision to allow non-essential shops in England to open from today. Nor would this be desirable, as the lockdown needs to be eased in stages that are consistent with containing Covid-19.Most people are unlikely to need explicit urging to be sensible when shopping. The nation's emergence from the crisis will be at risk, however, if the official message on public health is unclear. The essence of the government's advice should be, as Boris Johnson said yesterday, that people can shop with confidence, yet that maintaining social distancing and habits of hygiene is essential if the easing is to be sustained.The rules must be simultaneously unambiguous and proportionate to the threat. The public can accept continued restrictions that are properly explained, and if they see that the government has a strategy for managing the crisis pending the development of a vaccine. Yet the government has made mistakes in its strategy and communication since the coronavirus spread beyond China's borders. Having been late in deciding on a lockdown, it has since implemented restrictions alternately with inconsistency and excessive onerousness.The government initially placed too much weight on speculative predictions by some social scientists about how consumers might chafe under lockdown. This was the notion that there would be a risk of ""behavioural fatigue"" (in nonjargon terms, of people getting fed up) if a lockdown were imposed too early. There was in reality a good deal of disagreement among behavioural scientists about this concept.In practice, British society has not only held together under peacetime restrictions unknown in modern times but shown a spirit of altruism. Public admiration for health professionals, as well as those working on public transport or in supermarkets, is unfeigned and universal. The panic buying of consumer staples at the start of the crisis has given way to responsible queuing and purchasing, without any need for government edicts or price controls.Most people will understand that, in a health crisis of such severity, public authorities will make mistakes. What is important now is to acknowledge and lift measures that are not justified and to apply consistently those that are. The government's two-metre social distancing rule is excessive in light of the World Health Organisation's advice that a distance of one metre is enough.Easing the rule will make it easier for shops and, when they are allowed to reopen, restaurants and pubs to trade profitably. Balanced with the mandatory wearing of masks on public transport from today, which will act as a reminder of the risks, it can boost the economy and combat the virus.Public health advice cannot afford ambiguity.Whereas the original ""stay home"" instruction has a clear meaning, subsequent guidance to ""stay alert"" against an enemy that cannot be seen has muddied the message. The stakes are high. Nothing would be more damaging than relaxing restrictions now only to have to reimpose them later to counter a second wave of the coronavirus. But a combination of public sense and government clarity about the road ahead can help contain the social and economic damage, while saving lives.",Newspaper
27,Sometimes people need to be told what to do,"June 1, 2020",International,i - Independent Print Ltd,633,633,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,Professor Eyal Winter,Sometimes people need to be told what to do,"Imagine a world where all traffic laws were replaced with voluntary guidelines and all speed cameras were dismantled. Imagine we exchanged all these for recommendations and behavioural nudges to encourage people to follow the guidelines. If this imaginary scenario scares you, you should have similar feelings about a lockdown exit strategy that relies primarily on soft guidelines instead of clear and mandatory restrictions.Why can't we rely on nudges to get people to abide by traffic rules? One would think that the fear of losing one's life in a car accident would suffice to get people to drive carefully. But, unfortunately, it does not. A car accident is an event too remote, fanciful, and rare to take seriously. The likelihood of a £100 fine combined with the shame associated with violating the law is way more effective. The very same logic applies for social distancing rules during lockdown easing.The Government has never made it fully clear which rules are mandatory and which are merely recommended guidelines. It seems, however, that there are only three rules where violation might be interpreted as an offence: leaving home while suspected to have contracted the virus either by symptoms or by testing; participating or organising a large gathering or a party; and threatening others with infection by coronavirus, for example by coughing in their direction.Even the few and ambiguous activities that are considered as offences stop being so if one has a ""reasonable excuse"" - what such excuse might be is left for us to decide.Successive governments have relied too heavily on soft policies (recommendations and nudges), a tradition that started with David Cameron's ""Nudge Unit"". Governments love it because it allows them to avoid unpopular policies, and to get it endorsed by experts. Academic advisers enjoy it, because they feel that they are being listened to. But too often there is one party that loses: the public!A typical nudge changes the behaviour of only 4 per cent to 7 per cent of the people exposed to it. Social distancing requires a very broad compliance to be effective, which is unlikely to be achieved without mandatory restrictions. The UK is among the few countries that did not impose mandatory use of masks, in spite of a comprehensive study by the Royal Society that unequivocally asserts that masks save lives. When the lockdown is gradually removed, and millions of people ""starving"" for shopping, entertainment and pubs start pouring into narrow spaces, masks are likely to be the only thing standing between them and the virus. Yet only about 20 per cent use them in the UK, compared with more than 80 per cent in Italy.Soft policies are useful in cases where at least one of the following conditions applies: when the alternative of mandatory rules is so repugnant that it makes many of us sick in terms of the violation of human rights; when the stakes are small; or when the person's behaviour has no major effect on the wellbeing of other people.Behavioural tools are used around the world to increase deceased organ donations, which is fine because mandating it would be repugnant. Nudging people to get tested for colon cancer is also fine. The stakes are high, but it's a personal decision that affects only the decision-maker.With Covid-19 nudging, however, the stakes are huge, in terms of the effects that one's decisions have on others. The alternative of mandatory restrictions is not repugnant. As Britons we should be proud of our liberal culture. But liberalism does not mean the right to get infected and infect others with a deadly virus.Professor Eyal Winter is the holder of the Andrews and Brunner Chair in Economics at Lancaster University, and has advised the British and Israeli governments on their coronavirus exit strategies",Newspaper
28,SAGE expert criticises UK for not using the word 'isolate' in Covid-19 Test and Trace scheme and warns less Brits may comply with programme designed to prevent a second wave,"June 9, 2020 Tuesday",International,MailOnline,2135,2135,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,Connor Boyd Health Reporter For Mailonline,SAGE expert criticises UK for not using the word 'isolate' in Covid-19 Test and Trace scheme and warns less Brits may comply with programme designed to prevent a second wave,"•Professor Susan Michie said she was 'puzzled' by move to leave out word 'isolate'•She claims isolating cases is most vital intervention to prevent second epidemic•A ccused Number 10 of confusing Britons with its mixed messaging about Covid                     A SAGE scientist today criticised the Government's decision to leave out the word 'isolate' from its coronavirus Test and Trace programme, claiming it will lead to less compliance.Professor Susan Michie, a psychologist at University College London, said isolating cases was the most vital part of the system and not including it in the title of the UK's flagship scheme was 'puzzling'.Professor Michie, also director of UCL's Centre for Behaviour Change and a member of SAGE, said the decision to leave out 'isolate' sent mixed messages to the public and could lead to Britons ignoring that aspect of the programme. Experts believe a fully functioning test and trace programme and high compliance from the public will be critical if the UK is to avoid a second wave of coronavirus as life slowly begins to revert to normal. Meanwhile, a leading epidemiologist warned a second lockdown is 'inevitable' in the winter unless the UK's testing capacity is ramped up dramatically because up to 500,000 people each day may have Covid-like symptoms in the colder months and need a test.[item name=video id=4402158 style=2 /]Currently Brits who have been in close contact with infected patients are being told to self-isolate for 14 days, even if they show no symptoms.There is growing concern that people will ignore self-isolation rules as society opens up. Professor Michie said her UCL team made it abundantly clear that straightforward, clear communication was needed to keep the public adhering to Covid-19 rules as lockdown eases and compliance dwindles.But there has been a 'disconnect' between the advice given to the Government and the public health messages being delivered to the public, she claims.[related]Professor Michie told the House of Lords Science and Technology Committee today: 'The other thing that is very puzzling to me is why the government has called it Test and Trace, when the World Health Organization (WHO) and many other countries call it Test, Trace and Isolate.'Because without isolation all of the rest of it is for nothing. We absolutely need the isolation. And if one doesn't have it in the label of the system, it's not communicating that this is a vital part of it.'We already know there are going to be really big difficulties with isolation if people are being asked to stay home for 14 days and not go to work, this is a big financial penalty.'Also at the House of Lords Science and Technology Committee:•SAGE scientists revealed they ditched the idea of 'social bubbles'after the scheme failed in New Zealand and models showed it would spike cases in the UK;•Leading experts called for Covid-19 swabs to be sent to Britons isolating under the UK's test and trace programme to incentivise people to stay at home;•Two third of Covid cases in the UK will go missed under the test and trace scheme because it only picks up on symptomatic people, scientists warned;•Ministers were encouraged to 'own up' to their mistakes during the response to the crisis to build up trust with the public in case a second lockdown is needed.What is the NHS Test and Trace system?  Anyone who develops Covid-associated symptoms is being told to self-isolate and get tested under the test and trace scheme.Close contacts of those who are found to be positive for the disease are then told to quarantine for 14 days - even if they test negative and are not sick. Boris Johnson's government has hired an enormous army of 50,000 people who will attempt to make this huge undertaking possible. Around 25,000 are contact tracers who will contact people who return positive coronavirus tests to grill them on their movements and their known associates. The idea is to build a picture of who they have come into contact with and so who might be at risk of a) becoming ill and b) passing it on to more people. Another 25,000 people in the scheme are testers, who will go out into the community and test these known associates.Either way, these known associates will be under orders to immediately quarantine, even if the tests they return are negative. Baroness Dido Harding, executive chairwoman of NHS Test and Trace, said the scheme was central to easing the lockdown further.She said: 'NHS Test and Trace is designed to enable the vast majority of us to be able to get on with our lives in a much more normal way. 'We will be trading national lockdown for individual isolation if we have symptoms.'Instead of 60 million people being in national lockdown, a much smaller number of us will be told we need to stay at home, either for seven days if we are ill or 14 days if we have been in close contact.' The UK's coronavirus tracing programme will be split into two parts.•Part One:People will be ordered to self-isolate for seven days if they develop symptoms. Anyone in the same household will have to do the same. Those people should then order a coronavirus test online or by calling 119. This will be available for residents in Wales from Saturday.If a test is positive, that victim must complete seven days in isolation. If the test comes back negative, no one needs to self-isolate.However, people with a positive test for Covid-19 will then be contacted via text message or email or by phone and told to answer questions.They will be asked to share phone numbers and email addresses for close contacts.For those under 18, they will receive a call from the team and a parent or guardian must give permission for the call to continue. •Part Two:People who have been listed as a person with whom a coronavirus victim has had close contact will receive a text message or an email.They will then be asked to self-isolate for up to 14 days based on when they last came into contact with that person.Other household members do not need to self-isolate unless symptoms are present.If they develop Covid-associated symptoms, all other household members should self-isolate and they should then order a test.If the test is positive, self-isolation must continue for seven days. If the test is negative, that person should still complete 14 days in case the virus is not showing.Test and trace requires people with symptoms to self-isolate and get tested. If they test positive their close contacts are then tracked down and also told to self-isolate.The system is designed to break the chain of transmission as quickly as possible in order to squash potential outbreaks and stop them from escalating. Professor Michie's team at UCL has been feeding the results of behavioural studies into SAGE to help steer its own scientific advice to the Government.But she claims there has been a 'lack of transparency' about what scientific advice is being used to guide policymakers.She told the committee: 'We've published many dozens of papers and they are presented to SAGE. But we don't have any feedback as to where those papers go or whether the advice is used in any way.'I think this would be very useful in the future to have people actually track through, from all the committees, in what way advice is being used and by whom.'Certainly in terms of communication, the committee has published two or three papers on principles of good communication.'I think several behavioural scientists have noticed a disconnect between those principles of good communication and what we see both at the verbal presentations at the press conferences, and also the communication around the change from the 'Stay at Home' messaging to 'Stay Alert'.' The Government has insisted on a centralised testing programme and seems unwilling to delegate responsibilities to local health bodies. There is growing concern among experts that Britons will not comply with isolation rules without the incentive of a test to confirm if they have coronavirus. Professor Andrew Hayward, director of the UCL Institute of Epidemiology and Health Care, told the committee today that a second lockdown would be inevitable in the event of another epidemic because the current test and trace programme is 'not sufficient'. Britons who report Covid-like symptoms are being tested under the contact tracing scheme, launched a fortnight ago. But Professor Hayward said the Government will not have the testing capacity to swab enough people in winter, when respiratory illnesses are rife. He added: 'We can see that during a normal summer about 100,000 people a day would have new symptoms of cough or fever or loss of sense a smell.'And that rises to about half a million a day during winter, so there is an enormous scale to this testing issue that I don't think has been truly appreciated.'If we are moving into a situation where we have a second wave during the winter - when we know we have way higher levels of respiratory infections - we will have way higher levels of people presenting with symptoms that could be Covid.'So we need to be able to ramp up testing capacity to way higher than it currently is if we are to pursue that strategy of test and trace as one of the main means of control.'We may need, probably will need, in a severe second wave to revert to lockdown. Because test and trace will not be sufficient.' Ministers are facing growing criticism over their refusal to publish data showing how many people have been contacted by NHS Test and Trace so far. Number 10 would only say the numbers will be released 'shortly' once the data has been verified. A leaked document revealed that just 10,000 close contacts were provided by 8,000 people who were diagnosed with coronavirus in England last week. The leaked document, seen by the BBC, gives a glimpse into how the crucial scheme is performing in its first week.But the figures only account for Covid-19 cases in the community and do not include people who were hospitalised with the virus.Professor Paul Hunter, an epidemiologist at the University of East Anglia, said: 'I think at the moment this is still very new and the people working the system are only really just getting their heads around how it works. There will still be a lot of wrinkles in the system.'But I think that the number of contacts being only a little over a one per case is somewhat surprising I think and somewhat disappointing.''There was a an unofficial pilot study in Sheffield, and they were reporting the fact they're finding that often people were unwilling to tell people about their contacts.'So maybe there was an element of that but maybe it's still gearing up and getting the system operating properly.'Professor Hunter said the contact tracing was complicated and there might be some communication problems across different parts of Government. The crucial test and trace system has been launched without the NHSX mobile app, which alerts people when they have come close to an infected person.But Transport Secretary last week appeared to confirm the app won't work perfectly when it is eventually launched nationwide to help halt the spread.He responded to claims the app - considered the 'cherry on the cake' of Number 10's flagship Test and Trace scheme - would be 'imperfect' and 'clunky' for several months.                     GOVERNMENT'S TEST AND TRACE SCHEME WILL BE OVERWHELMED IN THE WINTER                     Professor Andrew Hayward, director of the UCL Institute of Epidemiology and Health Care, told Peers today that a second lockdown would be inevitable in the event of another epidemic because the current test and trace programme is 'not sufficient'. Britons who report Covid-like symptoms are being tested under the contact tracing scheme, launched a fortnight ago. But Professor Hayward said the Government will not have the testing capacity to swab enough people in winter, when respiratory illnesses are rife and the number of people reporting fevers surges. He added: 'We can see that during a normal summer about 100,000 people a day would have new symptoms of cough or fever or loss of sense a smell.'And that rises to about half a million a day during winter, so there is an enormous scale to this testing issue that I don't think has been truly appreciated.'If we are moving into a situation where we have a second wave during the winter -when we know we have way higher levels of respiratory infections - we will have way higher levels of people presenting with symptoms that could be Covid.'So we need to be able to ramp up testing capacity to way higher than it currently is if we are to pursue that strategy of test and trace as one of the main means of control.'We may need, probably will need, in a severe second wave to revert to lockdown.

30,Sage sidelined as 'secretive' unit takes over virus response;Expert advice ; Scientists complain that new Joint Biosecurity Centre's work and staffing is 'shrouded in mystery',"July 9, 2020 Thursday",International,The Daily Telegraph (London),845,845,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,"Laura Donnelly, Hayley Dixon and Harry Yorke",Sage sidelined as 'secretive' unit takes over virus responseExpert advice ; Scientists complain that new Joint Biosecurity Centre's work and staffing is 'shrouded in mystery',"THE Scientific Advisory Group on Emergencies (Sage) appears to have been sidelined as ministers take more direct control of the coronavirus crisis.Now, an expanded Joint Biosecurity Centre (JBC) will take a more prominent role co-ordinating the virus response.Last month, Downing Street appointed a senior spy to lead the unit, monitor the spread of coronavirus, advise ministers on the ""alert level"" for the virus and recommend actions to suppress new outbreaks.Now, it has emerged that Sage - led by Sir Patrick Vallance, the Chief Scientific Adviser, and Prof Chris Whitty, the Chief Medical Officer - will meet less frequently, as its subgroups directly advise the Government.Scientists last night expressed concern, saying the work of the new unit was ""shrouded in mystery"".A member of one Sage subcommittee, speaking on condition of anonymity, told The Daily Telegraph that it had been ""mentioned in passing that they would now report directly to ministers"". They were told by officials that they had been ""doing a lot of work"" and they were reducing their sitting hours to reduce the burden on them.The scientists in one group said they were surprised to be told they would not be meeting at all during August.The source questioned what the purpose of Sage would be if the committee no longer had access to evidence from subgroups, which they considered before reporting to the Government. Sage said working groups would advise government departments directly, and ""support them more directly"" but not report straight to ministers.Sage meetings have been reduced from twice to once a week, and in future will occur whenever deemed necessary, sources said.Prof Susan Michie, who sits on the behavioural science subcommittee and on Sage, criticised a lack of transparency over the moves, saying the work of the JBC was ""shrouded in secrecy"".""In order to get trust, it is really important that there is openness, transparency and an explanation of the basis on which advice is given,"" she said.""We know little about this new body and who is on it. Who are the scientists? What are the criteria used for selecting them? What is the governance and accountability? There are scientists on Sage who work for universities and are independent, but the new body appears to be a government command and control operation.""Prof Michie, the director of the UCL Centre for Behaviour Change, added: ""I think that this is circumventing Sage. There has been no explanation as to why there is a change in the system, it appears to have been set up without transparency or an explanation of the rationale.""Sage itself was widely criticised for a lack of transparency at the start of the crisis, and it took months before the group's membership was revealed.The scientific advice behind the Government's strategy has repeatedly come under scrutiny, with concern that it has left Britain too slow in its response, and late to adopt policies such as use of face coverings.Prof Robert Dingwall, a member of the New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group, said: ""Experience has shown that the present structures are not ideal, although I am not sure that the JBC is the right way to go."" He expressed concern that there was little public information about the unit's staffing and working, calling for a commitment to transparency in its advice and reports.A Sage member who sits on the modelling subgroup, said: ""There was a lot of criticism in March and April about the anonymity of Sage. It seems like we're back there, no one really knows who is on the JBC and so we're now in a situation where we're not quite clear of the expertise of people on the JBC, who are now taking responsibility for advising the Government going forward."" A senior government source said the changes had been implemented because the nature of the UK's response to the pandemic was changing.They said much of the Government's decision making was now based on how to manage exiting the lockdown. This meant ministers were increasingly concerned with the testing data being collected by the JBC, used to identify and monitor local outbreaks.They said Sage would still play an important role in analysing the risks of a second wave of the virus and providing advice on winter preparedness. A Sage spokesman said its scientists would continue to provide ministers with ""a single consensus view of scientific advice"" to inform its response. They added: ""The JBC will complement the work of Sage, providing more operational focus including data analysis and epidemiological expertise, with the aim of ensuring that outbreaks of coronavirus are detected and brought under control quickly.""The committee recommended the creation of JBC, formed to help the UK's chief medical officers set the threat levels in each of the four nations.Last month, Dr Clare Gardiner, the head of cyber resilience and strategy at the National Cyber Security Centre, part of GCHQ, became the JBC's first director-general.'We know little about this body. Who are the scientists? What are the criteria used for selecting them?'",Newspaper
31,"South Korean-style Covid-19 hotels could help to stop Britons flouting self-isolation rules amid fears only 15% are fully complying, SAGE expert suggests","June 10, 2020 Wednesday",International,MailOnline,1807,1807,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,Connor Boyd Health Reporter For Mailonline,"South Korean-style Covid-19 hotels could help to stop Britons flouting self-isolation rules amid fears only 15% are fully complying, SAGE expert suggests","•Professor Lucy Yardley said test and trace could fail due to low compliance in UK•Behavioural scientist warned even people with symptoms not adhering to rules•Suggested setting up designated hotels for people to self-isolate, like in Korea                     Britons tracked down by contact tracers should be put up in quarantine hotels to clamp down on the tens of thousands of people flouting coronavirus self-isolation rules, one of Number 10's scientific advisers has suggested.The Government is relying on its test and trace programme to stop a resurgence of Covid-19 as the UK slowly begins to reopen from the draconian lockdown imposed on March 23.But the scheme - which is still missing the app that was promised for mid-May - requires Brits to self-isolate for 14 days after they have been in contact with a Covid-19 patient, even if they don't show any symptoms of the disease.Lucy Yardley, professor of health psychology at Bristol and Southampton universities, warned the programme could fail because of low compliance.She suggested putting suspected cases in dedicated hotels where they are far more likely to comply, as has been done in South Korea, India and some parts of South America.This idea hinges on using hotels as isolation zones, where people who come from cramped housing in poorer areas, from care homes or who are homeless, for example, can stay and be looked after while they recover and complete their isolation period.This could relieve pressure from people who may struggle to look after themselves at home, pay for necessities if they are out of work or be unable to go to food banks or shops, for example. It comes as one Whitehall source yesterday claimed only 15 per cent of the public were strictly adhering to social distancing and lockdown rules. There is growing concern that as society reopens, compliance will dwindle because people perceive the Covid-19 threat to be low. Professor Yardley, part of SAGE and its subgroup for behavioural science, said the committee had seen evidence that even Britons with Covid-like symptoms were not self-isolating.[related]WHAT ARE QUARANTINE HOTELS?   Asian countries such as South Korea and India have been using hotels as isolation zones for suspected patients since the tourism industry shut down at the start of the crisis.The rooms were prioritised for people with mild or no symptoms who were required to self-isolate following contact tracing efforts.Rooms were provided free of charge and provided mostly to people who could not self-isolate at home or because they were homeless or in a care home.The move had the added benefit of reducing job loss in the tourism and hospitality industries - two of the hardest-hit by the crisis. The hotels have since been used in Brazil for impoverished coronavirus patients living in favelas in Rio de Janeiro, where social distancing is near-impossible.She told the House of Lords Science and Technology Committee yesterday: 'We have never managed to accomplish good adherence to self-isolation, not even in the earliest stages.'We have data that when people thought or said they were adhering they were leaving the home while symptomatic. We have to understand better the various reasons why people are doing that, despite good intentions.'Experts believe a fully functioning test and trace programme and high compliance from the public will be critical if the UK is to avoid a second wave as life slowly begins to revert to normal. Test and trace requires people with symptoms to self-isolate and get tested. If they test positive their close contacts are then tracked down and also told to self-isolate.The system is designed to break the chain of transmission as quickly as possible in order to squash potential outbreaks and stop them from escalating.But one Whitehall source told The Times that Government estimates suggested just one in six people were fully complying with isolation rules.Professor Yardley said some people were ignoring the curbs because they did not have the financial security to skip work, while others lived in crowded homes where isolating was impossible.She suggested the Government needed to look at extra financial support or dedicated Covid hotels to help support the policy.Professor Yardley told Peers: 'We know a lot of [non-compliance] has to do with not having sufficient support or income.'One of the problems is the rules ask people to isolate at home, potentially putting their closest family member at greater risk.'[item name=video id=4404718 style=2 /]GOVERNMENT'S TEST AND TRACE SCHEME WILL BE OVERWHELMED IN THE WINTER   Professor Andrew Hayward, director of the UCL Institute of Epidemiology and Health Care, told Peers that a second lockdown would be inevitable in the event of another epidemic because the current test and trace programme is 'not sufficient'.

The hotels have since been used in Brazil for impoverished coronavirus patients living in favelas in Rio de Janeiro, where officials were worried the virus could devastate entire communities. Professor Susan Michie, a psychologist at University College London, who is also on SAGE's behavioural science panel, also criticised the Government's decision to leave out the word 'isolate' from its coronavirus Test and Trace programme.She told Peers that isolating cases was the most vital part of the system and not including it in the title of the UK's flagship scheme was 'puzzling'.Professor Michie said the decision to leave out 'isolate' sent mixed messages to the public and could lead to Britons ignoring that aspect of the programme.'The other thing that is very puzzling to me is why the government has called it Test and Trace, when the World Health Organization (WHO) and many other countries call it Test, Trace and Isolate,' she said.'Because without isolation all of the rest of it is for nothing. We absolutely need the isolation. And if one doesn't have it in the label of the system, it's not communicating that this is a vital part of it.'We already know there are going to be really big difficulties with isolation if people are being asked to stay home for 14 days and not go to work, this is a big financial penalty.'[item name=video id=4404720 style=2 /]What is the NHS Test and Trace system?  Anyone who develops Covid-associated symptoms is being told to self-isolate and get tested under the test and trace scheme.Close contacts of those who are found to be positive for the disease are then told to quarantine for 14 days - even if they test negative and are not sick. Boris Johnson's government has hired an enormous army of 50,000 people who will attempt to make this huge undertaking possible. Around 25,000 are contact tracers who will contact people who return positive coronavirus tests to grill them on their movements and their known associates. The idea is to build a picture of who they have come into contact with and so who might be at risk of a) becoming ill and b) passing it on to more people. Another 25,000 people in the scheme are testers, who will go out into the community and test these known associates.Either way, these known associates will be under orders to immediately quarantine, even if the tests they return are negative. Baroness Dido Harding, executive chairwoman of NHS Test and Trace, said the scheme was central to easing the lockdown further.She said: 'NHS Test and Trace is designed to enable the vast majority of us to be able to get on with our lives in a much more normal way. 'We will be trading national lockdown for individual isolation if we have symptoms.'Instead of 60 million people being in national lockdown, a much smaller number of us will be told we need to stay at home, either for seven days if we are ill or 14 days if we have been in close contact.' The UK's coronavirus tracing programme will be split into two parts.•Part One:People will be ordered to self-isolate for seven days if they develop symptoms. Anyone in the same household will have to do the same. Those people should then order a coronavirus test online or by calling 119. This will be available for residents in Wales from Saturday.If a test is positive, that victim must complete seven days in isolation. If the test comes back negative, no one needs to self-isolate.However, people with a positive test for Covid-19 will then be contacted via text message or email or by phone and told to answer questions.They will be asked to share phone numbers and email addresses for close contacts.For those under 18, they will receive a call from the team and a parent or guardian must give permission for the call to continue. •Part Two:People who have been listed as a person with whom a coronavirus victim has had close contact will receive a text message or an email.They will then be asked to self-isolate for up to 14 days based on when they last came into contact with that person.Other household members do not need to self-isolate unless symptoms are present.If they develop Covid-associated symptoms, all other household members should self-isolate and they should then order a test.If the test is positive, self-isolation must continue for seven days. If the test is negative, that person should still complete 14 days in case the virus is not showing.",Web Publication
32,TRA ASHED;TOP ADVISER FURY AS PM STANDS BY CUMMINGSlScientist blasts BoJo for 'wrecking public trust'lFears that refusal to bin aide is rules flout threat,"May 25, 2020 Monday",International,The Sun (England),994,994,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,CHRIS MUSSON,TRA ASHEDTOP ADVISER FURY AS PM STANDS BY CUMMINGSlScientist blasts BoJo for 'wrecking public trust'lFears that refusal to bin aide is rules flout threat,"BORIS Johnson's defence of Dominic Cummings' lockdown trip has ""trashed"" any idea that he respects the public, one of his elite scientific advisers said last night.The blast from Professor Stephen Reicher came amid a wave of fury over the Prime Minister's refusal to fire his top aide.Even Tory MPs demanded the axing of Mr Cummings after it emerged he and his wife, who have both caught Covid-19, travelled 260 miles from London to Durham in March.But in a dramatic televised briefing, the PM backed his chief adviser, who self-isolated with their four-year-old son at a family property.Mr Johnson said he took the matter ""seriously"" and revealed he'd had ""extensive face-to-face conversations with Dominic Cummings"" yesterday.He went on: ""I've concluded that in travelling to find the right kind of childcare - at the moment when he and his wife were about to be incapacitated by coronavirus and when he had no alternative - I think that he followed the instincts of every father and every parent.""Though there have been many other allegations about what happened when he was in self-isolation, thereafter, some of them palpably false, I believe that in every respect he has acted responsibly and legally and with integrity and with the overwhelming aim of stopping the spread of the virus and saving lives.""But his Downing Street comments sparked fierce criticism from across the political spectrum.And the PM was savaged by Prof Reicher, a member of the UK Government's Scientific Pandemic Influenza Group on Behaviours. The St Andrews University academic has been advising ministers on how to get the public to comply with lockdown rules.But in an angry Twitter blast, he said: ""As one of those involved in SPI-B, the Government advisory group on behavioural science, I can say that in a few short minutes tonight Boris Johnson has trashed all the advice we have given on how to build trust and secure adherence to the measures necessary to control Covid-19.""He continued: ""Be open and honest, we said. Trashed. Respect the public, we said. Trashed.""Ensure equity, so everyone is treated the same, we said. Trashed.""Be consistent, we said. Trashed.Make clear 'we are all in it together'.Trashed."" Prof Reicher added last night: ""It is very hard to provide scientific advice to a government which doesn't want to listen to science.""He then posted a link to a series of documents produced by SPI-B and said: ""I hope, however, that the public will read our papers and continue to make up for this bad government with their own good sense.""The storm followed further revelations yesterday about Mr Cummings, the Vote Leave supremo who helped Mr Johnson to power.He has now been accused of breaking the lockdown three times, after apparently being spotted in north-east England on April 12 and 19.Over the weekend, No10 admitted Mr Cummings had driven from his London home to Durham in March after his wife had started to display Covid-19 symptoms, Outburst .had become fearful e no one to look after claiming they there would be their child if he also took ill.But reports claim Mr Cummings made a second trip to Durham and was seen there on April 19.That was five days after he was photographed on his return to Westminster. He has denied this.A second witness told two Sunday newspapers they saw him on Easter Sunday in Barnard Castle, a popular tourist location 30 miles from Durham. This has also been denied. At last night's No10 media briefing, Mr Johnson was quizzed on whether his stance would undermine his own health message.And he was asked to compare it with what happened to Dr Catherine Calderwood, Scotland's former Chief Medical Officer - who quit after The Scottish Sun exposed her jaunts from Edinburgh to a holiday home in Fife.The PM replied: ""The sharp distinction is that, unlike the lady, Mr Cummings actually went into lockdown, because he had symptoms.""He went into self-isolation for 14 days or more and that is what you should do. And the particular circumstances of his isolation, as I've said now several times, were determined by the childcare needs of the family.""But his justification for not sacking Mr Cummings appeared to be criticised by Scots Health Secretary Jeane Freeman.Speaking at the Scottish Government's coronavirus briefing in Edinburgh, she insisted the selfisolation. Prof Reicher isolation ""message may have become confused in the last 24 hours because of events in other parts of the UK"".Ms Freeman went on to state that self-isolation was not the same as lockdown and means ""you should not leave the house for any reason"".Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said of the PM: ""He's treating the British public with contempt.""He added: ""Millions of people across the country have made the most agonising choices not to visit relatives, some of whom were ill, dying, not to go to funerals. They deserve better answers than they got from the Prime Minister today.""Tory MPs also lined up to slate Mr Johnson's actions, with ex-minister Paul Maynard saying he shared ""dismay"" at the response.He hit out: ""It is a classic case of, 'Do as I say, not as I do'. And it is not as if he was unfamiliar with guidance he himself helped draw up.""Referring to Mr Cummings, he added: ""It seems to me to be utterly indefensible and his position wholly untenable.""Veteran Tory Sir Roger Gale said: ""I'm very disappointed, I think it was an opportunity to put this to bed and I fear that now the story is simply going to run and run.""But Scots Tory leader Jackson Carlaw - who condemned Dr Calderwood in April - backed the PM last night.He said: ""I've heard what the Prime Minister has said and it is a situation for him to judge.""He has reached a conclusion and we must all now focus on continuing to beat this dreadful pandemic.""I want the Prime Minister to be able to continue his excellent work leading the country out of lockdown and I am glad that he set out his plans clearly today.""chris.musson@the-sun.co.uk The Sun Says - Page Ten",Newspaper
33,Government scientists talked up herd immunity despite warnings about early reinfection;Members of influential panel guiding the government's response to the virus warned that the length of immunity was 'unclear',"May 17, 2020 Sunday",International,telegraph.co.uk,1021,1021,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,"By Edward Malnick, Sunday Political Editor",Government scientists talked up herd immunity despite warnings about early reinfectionMembers of influential panel guiding the government's response to the virus warned that the length of immunity was 'unclear',"Government scientists talked up the prospect of the country building up a ""herd immunity"" to Covid-19 despite private warnings that patients could become re-infected as little as three months after their first illness, The Telegraph can disclose.Members of one of the most influential panels guiding the government's response to the virus warned that the length of immunity was ""unclear"" and that just 12 weeks ""may be a reasonable point"" after which those who suffered a mild illness could become susceptible to a second infection.The private warnings were issued on March 13, the same day that Sir Patrick Vallance, the chief scientific adviser, sparked major controversy when he said the Government's aim was to ""build up some kind of herd immunity so more people are immune to this disease"".Now it can be disclosed that, on the same day, the New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group (Nervtag) discussed whether there would be a ""second wave"" of illnesses ""due to reinfection"", as they considered whether a person ""can be re-infected within a matter of months"".Discussing previous types of coronavirus, the group concluded: ""In summary, there is evidence that in people with mild illness, the antibody response can wane quite rapidly and there is evidence that people can get re-infected and can shed quite robust titres of virus within 2-3 months.""One study in Kenya showed that 28 per cent of patients became reinfected by an earlier type of coronavirus, first identified in 2004. ""These were split into two groups; those with symptoms and those without symptoms"", Nervtag was told. Minutes of the meeting, attended by several members of the separate Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), state: ""Concerns were raised that the length of immunity is unclear. Evidence from endemic coronaviruses is that after a mild infection antibody response may wane and individuals can become re-infected and shed further virus.""Three months may be a reasonable point after which susceptibility due to waning immunity may occur in those who suffered a mild initial infection.""Members agreed that the novel nature of SARS-CoV-2 means that immune response may be more robust than for seasonal coronaviruses. Members agreed that although there is considerable uncertainty, reinfection is a possibility that should be considered in modelling and longitudinal studies to identify reinfections are recommended.""Two days earlier, David Halpern, the chief executive of the government-owned Behavioural Insights Team, had suggested that high risk groups could be ""cocooned"" until ""herd immunity has been achieved in the rest of the population"".In a television interview, Sir Patrick said that herd immunity could be achieved if ""about 60 per cent"" of the population became infected with the virus. He said he was working on the basis that the vast majority of patients only suffered from a mild illness. Sir Patrick's initial remarks came as part of a defence of decisions to delay drastic measures, such as the closure of schools and restaurants, in order to halt the spread of the virus.He said: ""Our aim is to try and reduce the peak, broaden the peak, not suppress it completely; also, because the vast majority of people get a mild illness, to build up some kind of herd immunity so more people are immune to this disease and we reduce the transmission, at the same time we protect those who are most vulnerable to it. Those are the key things we need to do.""Following a major backlash, as part of which the Government was accused of ""risking many more lives than necessary"", Matt Hancock, the Health Secretary, said in an article for The Telegraph: ""We have a plan, based on the expertise of world-leading scientists. Herd immunity is not a part of it. That is a scientific concept, not a goal or a strategy.""Mr Hancock this weekend announced that up to 20,000 people were being asked to take part in a new government-funded study to help determine what proportion of the population has already had the infection, the duration of immunity after being infected, and why the virus affects people differently.The study, led by UK Biobank, forms part of the Government's plans to use ""surveillance testing"" to help learn more about the virus. The Nervtag meeting on March 13 was chaired by Peter Horby, a professor of Emerging Infectious Diseases and Global Health, who is also a member of Sage. He said that Sage's sub-group on modelling were meeting the following week and ""would like a view from Nervtag on the issue of reinfection.""John Edmunds, professor of infectious disease modelling at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, another member of Sage, ""noted the urgent question for this epidemic was whether there is evidence of any short-term sterilising immunity-can a person can be re-infected within a matter of months.""A second question of longer term immunity could be addressed in due course. Members discussed whether there was going to be a second wave due to reinfection and how long the sterile immunity window was.""Earlier this month, Sir Patrick told MPs that while evidence suggested that the vast majority of infected patients ""get some form of antibody response"", ""what we don't know is the degree of immune protection that provides.""He added: ""The situation at the moment is that an antibody response is likely in most people; it is likely to provide some form of immune protection, but how much we don't know. Experience from other coronaviruses suggests that it may last for one, two or three years but not for many, many years."" A Government spokesman said: ""This document makes it utterly clear that at the time this meeting took place, evidence around how long the immunity that antibodies might provide against this virus was unclear. Two months later, evidence is still being gathered and assessed. But it is still too early for anything like a final judgment on this.""We have repeatedly made clear that herd immunity has never been the Government's policy or goal.""This is an unprecedented global pandemic and we have taken the right steps at the right time to combat it.""",Newspaper; Web Publication

Two days earlier, David Halpern, of the part Government-owned Behavioural Insights Team, suggested highrisk groups could be ""cocooned"" until ""herd immunity has been achieved in the rest of the population"".On television, Sir Patrick said herd immunity could be achieved if ""about 60 per cent"" of the population became infected. He made his initial remarks as part of a defence of decisions to delay drastic restriction measures in order to halt the spread of the virus.Sir Patrick said: ""Our aim is to try and reduce the peak, broaden the peak, not suppress it completely; also, because the vast majority get a mild illness, to build up some kind of herd immunity so more people are immune to this disease and we reduce the transmission, at the same time we protect those who are most vulnerable to it.""A government spokesman said: ""This document makes it utterly clear that at the time this meeting took place, evidence around how long the immunity that antibodies might provide against this virus was unclear. Two months later, evidence is still being gathered and assessed. But it is still too early for a final judgment on this. We have repeatedly made clear that herd immunity has never been the Government's policy or goal.",Newspaper
35,"From evasion to evisceration: how the Cummings lockdown story unfolded;As thousands died, the story of the PM's top adviser waxed and waned in unpredictable ways. Its impact is as yet unknownCoronavirus - latest updatesSee all our coronavirus coverage","May 29, 2020 Friday",International,The Guardian (London),2124,2124,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,Archie Bland and Matthew Weaver,"From evasion to evisceration: how the Cummings lockdown story unfoldedAs thousands died, the story of the PM's top adviser waxed and waned in unpredictable ways. Its impact is as yet unknownCoronavirus - latest updatesSee all our coronavirus coverage","The first inkling of the story that shook Downing Street to its core came at the beginning of April.It was the first Sunday of the month, a couple of hours before the Queen's stirring promise to the nation that, however hard it was to endure separation from our loved ones, ""we will meet again"". Boris Johnson was seriously ill, and that evening it would be announced that the prime minister had been admitted to hospital.As it would turn out, however, one of the most consequential news events of the day was one almost nobody knew about.The Guardian had been told that Dominic Cummings, the cartoon bogeyman of remain voters and the liberal left, was listening to Dancing Queen in his parents' front drive.The Cummings family property is on a fast-moving A road and almost completely hidden behind bushes.The chances of anyone spotting a special adviser enjoying a bit of Abba during quarantine - much less recognising him - were slim enough that you could see why you might not be particularly worried about it. But as it happened, someone did see. And they wanted the Guardian to know.Could Dominic Cummings, the architect of the ""Stay home"" campaign that every minister was imploring the nation to follow, really have gone to Durham? The Guardian asked a straightforward question of No 10. The response was enough to make you wonder: ""It'll be a no comment on that one. We wouldn't get into locations of individual members of staff.""That oddly evasive reply warranted further investigation. And by the end of that week, there was enough corroborating detail to go back to Downing Street. A new set of questions about the senior adviser's locations, now loaded with specific details, was again met with a flat refusal to comment.It was Friday, 10 April. Exactly six weeks later, when the Guardian and Daily Mirror made a final approach for comment before that evening's publication, Downing Street would complain that they had not been given enough time.Over the intervening period, as hundreds more deaths were reported each day and the rest of the country wondered when the dull nightmare of lockdown would end, the story rushed forward and receded in unpredictable ways.The attempts to put the media off the scent, however, were not confined to gnomic remarks from Downing Street, which at one point had told another journalist that Cummings was ""at home"".Cummings' wife, Mary Wakefield, wrote a piece for the Spectator (subscription) - which she also read out on Radio 4 - that was so artfully constructed that on a casual read it seemed to rule out the possibility that the family had left their home at all.And surely Cummings would think it foolish to write a sidebar to this article, reflecting on the same period, if the family idyll he described was more than 250 miles from home?On a second look, though, both articles were curiously devoid of geographical specifics, until Wakefield finally referred to the family ""emerging ... into the almost comical uncertainty of London lockdown"". The line implied           they had been cocooned within the capital all along but, tantalisingly, stopped short of saying so outright.Downing Street's reticence to come clean was understandable.In early May, the government scientist Prof Neil Ferguson was forced to resign after the Daily Telegraph splashed on the revelation that his lover had visited him at home. Cabinet ministers jumped on the indiscretion, proclaiming he was right to quit.But the wriggling and obfuscation would come to a spectacular end - and from an unlikely source.In response to a question from the Mirror, with whom the Guardian had agreed to work, Durham police provided a statement confirming that the force had spoken to the family about Cummings' visit.At 8pm on           22           May, both newspapers published their stories.The internet was swiftly awash with indignation and calls for the special adviser to resign.Downing Street was still declining to speak to the Guardian on the record, while simultaneously providing other media with anonymous source quotes condemning the stories as ""fake news"".Two of the country's most eminent behavioural scientists got the news as they ate dinner together last Friday night, and immediately recognised the gravity of what had been disclosed, not as a matter of political drama, but as a profound risk to public adherence to the lockdown rules.""We looked at each other and said: ' What is this?',"" said Robert West, a professor of health psychology at University College London, whose wife, Susan Michie, is director of the same university's Centre for Behaviour Change and a fellow attendee of the Scientific Advisory Group on Emergencies' behavioural sub-group.""We had a very strong sense right away that something was up,"" West said. ""There were already concerns about how on earth we're going to move to the next phase when messaging trust is ebbing away. And then this was like a bombshell.""The next morning, Downing Street provided the kind of detailed statement that the Guardian had been seeking for weeks. But it brought as much confusion as clarity.A spokesman confirmed the trip, saying that it was ""essential ... to ensure his young child could be properly cared for"".But it went on: ""At no stage was he [Cummings] or his family spoken to by the police about this matter.""That line - later justified by an explanation that a conversation with Cummings' father had been at his request and primarily about security matters rather than a breach of lockdown - is understood to have caused consternation at the Durham force, which found itself at the centre of a political storm, and was forced to reiterate that a conversation had indeed taken place. (Two days later, it would say that the call focused on security.)But amid cries for clarity, little further information was on offer.Cummings refused to let Downing Street issue a statement on his behalf, the Sunday Times reported, with one insider being quoted as saying: ""He insisted on handling it all himself.""If Downing Street had calculated that a stonewall strategy would make the story go away, they could hardly have been more wrong - thanks largely to a retired chemistry teacher. Robin Lees got in touch with the Guardian via email. ""Just read your report in the Guardian and straight away reminded of an experience in Barnard Castle where I live on April 12th this year,"" he wrote, before going on to describe his sighting of Cummings, and adding: ""I went home and told my wife, but we thought he must be in London.""Lees had written down a number plate immediately, he added, and Googled it as soon as he got home - a claim corroborated by his search history.Hearing the transport secretary's attempt to justify the visit by saying that Cummings had hunkered down and had not moved around, Lees was indignant. ""Sorry if this has led you off at a tangent,"" he wrote. ""But Grant Shapps kept saying he stayed in one place!""After new stories were published by the Observer and Sunday Mirror that evening, featuring the Barnard Castle account as well as a separate allegation - consistently denied - of a later visit to the area, the ""stay put"" defence slid out of the government's story, to be replaced by a fierce critique of ""campaigning newspapers"".But if that was an attempt to define the subject as being one restricted to ideological left-wing interest, the response on Sunday and afterwards made it impossible to sustain. Led by the avowed Brexiter (and Cummings opponent) Steve Baker, Conservative MPs started to call for his resignation; with tens of thousands of angry messages sent by constituents, almost 50 more had done so by Friday.The Daily Mail published a ferocious splash on Monday morning, with the headline: WHAT PLANET ARE THEY ON?Meanwhile, TV and radio producers reported difficulty persuading all but a small cast of loyalists to defend Cummings' position on air, with one saying: ""Quite a lot of the usual suspects were actually furious about it. If you listened, the same people popped up again and again.""Polls emerged showing a clear majority of the public felt the adviser had broken the rules, and ought to resign. It was time for the government to try a different approach: they promised us a rose garden.Like all good divas, Cummings came out to greet his audience on Downing Street's sunlit back lawn half an hour late. Despite the wait, his nearly unprecedented press conference drew a live TV audience of 5.5 million. In an extraordinary prepared statement, he laid out a complex story of difficult personal circumstances, ingenious and necessary solutions, and dismayingly compromised eyesight.Even as he spoke, though, there was little sense that the firestorm would abate. Steven Swinford, the deputy political editor of the Times, tweeted that cabinet ministers were unsatisfied: ""He's saying he's so much more important than us plebs,"" one told him. Another concluded: ""We're losing trust and confidence - it's draining away before our eyes.""And there were oddities and inconsistencies even in the story that Cummings had set out in such extraordinary detail. Wakefield can drive, or at least could in 2000, when she wrote in a Spectator travel piece about a trip to Texas : ""I drove for an hour every morning, slaloming past the road-rage wrecks of battered trucks, up the 135 from Dallas to Denton.""And if he had only gone to the ""outskirts"" of Barnard Castle, as he claimed, why had he been sighted parked up on the far side of the river from the route he was most likely to have taken?But such queries were unavailable to the journalists at the briefing, who, in line with normal Downing Street practice, had had to give up their phones before going in. The rose garden appearance did not calm the public mood - and, perhaps most troubling of all for a government seeking to have its messaging taken wholly seriously, stoked widespread ridicule. Memes abounded, including ""Should have gone to Barnard Castle"" riffs on the famous Specsavers ad. Staff could ""hardly believe it"", said Maria Sattar, the opthalmic director in the company's Barnard Castle branch, who noted that the spoofs ""gave us a chuckle"". One Twitter account showed a page from Brewer's slang dictionary which, if real, said ""Barney Castle"" was existing slang for a ""pathetic excuse"" deriving from a 16th century general's refusal to leave his fortified position there to engage in battle. And the comedian Paddy McGuinness posted a reworked version of (Is This The Way To) Amarillo, concluding in a rousing chorus of ""sha la la la la la bullshit"". I've finally lost it in lockdown! ?? #isthisthewaytobarnardcastle           pic.twitter.com/QHuuxirL63 - Paddy McGuinness (@PaddyMcGuinness)            May 26, 2020Durham's acting police and crime commissioner, Steve White, could sense the danger and urged the force to ""establish the facts"" around the claims.He'd been listening to the ""vox pops"" from Barnard Castle on the Sunday night news, not far from his home.""When people think that we're fibbing, that we're under the thumb of No 10, that's when it starts to become an issue for me,"" he said. ""Seeing that dismay and anger at what people were hearing - we have to demonstrate that whatever else is going on, they can trust Durham police.""That's when I had to act."" That move eventually led the force to the conclusion on Thursday that Cummings may have committed a ""minor breach"" of the lockdown rules.By then, 100 or more Tory MPs had criticised Cummings or called for him to go; every ministerial briefing and interview had been dominated by the furore, and the government's poll ratings had tumbled under the weight of middle-England indignation.Yet Cummings was still in place.The more significant question, of what this will mean for public adherence to lockdown and the new test-and-trace system, is yet to be answered.West, the behavioural scientist, says that an earlier resignation or admission of culpability would have been far better, but that the situation could still, theoretically, be improved.""It's possible the damage will be mitigated by other people stepping in and saying: 'Don't do it for Cummings, do it for the community,'"" he said. ""But it's like trying to climb an escalator when it's going down. It's not a question of whether lives will be lost now; it's a question of how many. But there is still some point in someone acting. Even too little too late can be enough, and in time.""For the sources who took the chance of coming forward, meanwhile, there has been at least some sense of vindication.Lees received an unsigned postcard addressed to the ""Retired chemistry teacher"" of Barnard Castle. ""I presume this is for you,"" the postal worker told him. ""Thank you for being so brave,"" the message read.",Newspaper
36,Willing to heed Sage advice?,"June 6, 2020",International,i - Independent Print Ltd,1824,1824,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,Jane Merrick and Hugo Gye report,Willing to heed Sage advice?,"The mantra of Boris Johnson and his ministers from the start of the coronavirus outbreak has been to ""follow the science"". But the minutes of Sage - the government's Scientific Advisory Group on Emergencies - shows their advice has not always been heeded by ministers until weeks later. From the first Covid-19 meeting in the middle of January, held at a government office block near to Parliament, these minutes also show the experts, too, underestimated just how severe an impact the deadly coronavirus would have on the UK.JANUARY THE GATHERING STORM As China recorded increasing numbers of deaths from Covid-19, centred around the city of Wuhan, scientists and government officials convened Sage for the first time on 22 January.The group was led by England's chief medical officer, Professor Chris Whitty, and the government's chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance. The discussion centred on the recommendations of the government's New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group - NERVTAG - on what steps, if any, should be taken to monitor travellers from China. NERVTAG did not advise screening at airports and ports, but did suggest public health information leaflets and posters. Sage agreed temperature screening was ""unlikely to be of value"" because of the risk of both false positives and false negatives. The scientists would review their position on screening if a ""simple, specific and rapid test was available and was deployable at scale across the UK"".Sage sounded a note of optimism on testing, however, declaring the UK had ""good centralised diagnostic capacity"" for Covid-19 and ""is days away from a specific test, which is scalable across the UK in weeks"".Such a test would prioritise people with symptoms who had a history of travelling to Wuhan but this would be kept under review. PHE was drawing up plans for isolating potentially infected individuals and tracing their contacts.In the end, the Government did not scale up mass testing until the middle of April, reaching a target of 100,000 tests a day by the end of that month.Sage's second meeting on 28 January noted that 50 per cent of new cases were now occurring outside of Wuhan. The UK had capacity of up to 500 tests a day.In the absence of reliable data, the Department of Health was mapping out a ""reasonable worst case scenario"" based on an influenza pandemic where no vaccine was available.Three days later, on the last day of January, the UK would record its first confirmed cases of coronavirus.FEBRUARY THE OPPORTUNITIES MISSED At Sage the focus remained on infected travellers from China coming into the UK. Its meeting on 3 February concluded travel restrictions were not ""meaningful"" unless they could cut imported infections by 95 per cent, which would need ""draconian"" measures such as quarantining new arrivals.A meeting advised that stopping public transport and large events would probably be ineffective, and a further discussion on 11 February concluded the direct impact of banning these would be ""low - because they make up only a small proportion of an attendee's contacts with other people"". Doing so risked behaviour that could accelerate infection, such as displacing people from football matches to crowded pubs.""In general, contacts tend to be less intimate and shorter at public gatherings than in other settings such as contacts with family members and co-workers,"" the scientists said.On 13 February, Sage concluded that ""neither travel restrictions within the UK nor prevention of mass gatherings would be effective in limiting transmission"".There was an acknowledgement that testing capacity in the UK may not be able to deal with a widespread outbreak: ""Although the UK is building regional diagnostic capability within weeks, overall capacity is limited. Capacity cannot be substantially increased during this winter influenza season.""By now, the scientists were concluding that - despite the confirmed number of cases in the UK being fewer than 10 - some may have been missed.PHE was carrying out contact tracing of known cases but on 20 February, Sage judged that ""there is evidence of local transmission unlinked to individuals who have travelled from China in Japan, Republic of Korea and Iran"".As such, it was proposed that contact tracing might be discontinued - something the scientists themselves knew would be controversial: ""Any decision to discontinue contact tracing will generate a public reaction - which requires consideration with input from behavioural scientists.""Yet on 28 February, the World Health Organisation was urging countries to keep up surveillance. A WHO-China joint report said governments should ""immediately expand surveillance to detect Covid-19 transmission chains by... adding testing for the Covid-19 virus to existing surveillance systems"".MARCH A DRAMATIC CHANGE IN STRATEGY On 4 March, Sage was sticking to its advice that banning mass gatherings would have little impact. A Sage sub-committee, the Scientific Pandemic Influenza Group on Behaviours (SPI-B), raised the prospect of herd immunity: ""One view is that explaining that healthy members of the community are building some immunity will make [not imposing lockdown] acceptable.""At the time, ministers were resisting calls by some public health experts and politicians to close schools, prevent care home visits and ban public gatherings.In early March, PHE was advising the risk of coronavirus infection inside care homes was ""unlikely"".A Cobra meeting on 12 March, chaired by Boris Johnson, was pivotal. Drawing on the advice made by Sage in its previous meetings, the Government would, for now, hold off on banning gatherings, closing schools and any other lockdown measures.The next day, as the Cheltenham Festival held its final day, the Prime Minister announced mass events would be banned the following week.Also at this point, community testing and contact tracing was halted due to what scientists acknowledged was substantial person to person transmission in the UK.The controversial PHE advice on care homes was removed, but elderly Covidpositive hospital patients were still being discharged into care homes.Also on 12 March, Sir Patrick talked of the possibility of herd immunity. He told a press conference at Downing Street: ""Our aim is not to stop everyone getting it, you can't do that. And it's not desirable, because you want to get some immunity in the population. We need to have immunity to protect ourselves from this in the future.""But just four days later, on 16 March, everything changed following an explosive report by Imperial College London warning that continuing without any lockdown measures could lead to 500,000 deaths and the collapse of the NHS.Scientists at the Sage meeting that day said: ""On the basis of accumulating data, including on NHS critical care capacity, the advice from Sage has changed regarding the speed of implementation of additional interventions."" UK cases were doubling in number every five to six days, with up to 10,000 new cases per day - far more than senior scientists had predicted . Social distancing measures should be introduced ""as soon as possible"", they said, and these measures ""will need to be accompanied by a significant increase in testing"".In response, the Prime Minister that evening told the public to stay away from pubs, cafes and theatres and to avoid unnecessary travel. But this was only voluntary advice. It was not until 20 March that all pubs and restaurants were ordered to shut and on 23 March Mr Johnson imposed a compulsory lockdown, including closure of schools.APRIL THE PEAK Going in to April, Sage's priority was ensuring the lockdown was bringing the number of cases down. Easing the measures would provoke ""a second wave of exponential epidemic growth"", the committee feared. The daily death toll peaked early in the month, but it became ever clearer that the centre of the epidemic had now moved to hospitals and - in particular - care homes.On 9 April, the scientists said: ""The epidemic may be reaching its peak, but could remain at a plateau for some time."" Subsequent data shows that the number of deaths had in fact peaked the day before. At the next Sage meeting they warned that ""nosocomial transmission"" - where the virus is passed on in medical and care settings - was an increasing threat, adding: ""Care homes also remain a concern.""At the end of the month, they were forced to acknowledge the outbreak in care homes was effectively out of control. On 28 April they found care home deaths had yet to peak; the fragmented nature of the sector made it harder to monitor the epidemic's progress, they complained.Over the course of April Sage's experts also paid increasing attention to the question of whether the public should be encouraged to wear face masks in public, performing a complete U-turn in just a couple of weeks. On 7 April they said that ""increased use of masks would have minimal effect""; two weeks later, they reported that covering your face in public is a good idea after all. It was not until 11 May that the Government changed its policy to recommend face coverings.MAY UNLOCKING LOCKDOWN Only in the last few weeks has Sage started analysing possible ways of exiting lockdown, but several recommendations appear to have been ignored. On 5 May scientists warned against easing measures based on ""predetermined dates"", but days later Boris Johnson unveiled his ""road map"" with each step given a target date.They also dropped a heavy hint that the Prime Minister's focus on R, the number which shows how quickly the virus is reproducing, would not be enough by itself to determine the right time for lifting lockdown. The committee said: ""The starting level of incidence is of critical importance"" - i.e. if you unlock before pushing the number of cases right down, you may never succeed in pushing the virus out of circulation before a vaccine is ready.Even in their fifth month of studying Covid-19, Sage's members were forced to admit they were still in the dark on many of the key questions - a reminder that ""following the science"" remains easier said than done. The effects of reopening schools are ""complex and highly uncertain"", the committee said on 1 May, adding that the knock-on effects, such as more parents going to work, would ultimately be more important than any transmission between the pupils.On 7 May, the last meeting for which the minutes have been published, Sage warned that if lockdown was to be eased gradually clear communication would be critical. ""Each step needs to be accompanied by very clear communication of the continued public health justification for remaining restrictions,"" the group said. Later that week, Mr Johnson replaced the ""Stay home"" message with ""Stay alert""; in the eyes of his critics, and most of the public, clarity had been replaced by confusion.Sage was still in the dark - a reminder 'following the science' is easier said than done",Newspaper

Its messaging around the need to act sensibly also drew concern after it was announced pubs in England would be able to serve customers from 6am on Saturday.Police and health workers warned that a lifting of hospitality restrictions could result in disorder and a rise in infections.On a day when the official death toll increased by 137 to 44,131, Johnson said the country had made great strides to bring the virus under control, and argued it was time for businesses to attempt to get back to work.In future, he said, the government would use targeted local measures, rather than blanket national ones to try to contain any second wave of infections.""The virus is still with us and the spike in Leicester has shown that,"" he said. ""If it starts running out of control again this government will not hesitate in putting on the brakes and reimposing restrictions.""I do want people to feel that it's safe to go and enjoy themselves and enjoy hospitality. But it's got to be done in a responsible way.""Asked whether he was happy with the easing of the restrictions, England's chief medical officer, Prof Chris Whitty, admitted it was ""not a risk-free next step"".""It is absolutely not, and that's why we have to be really serious about it."" He said the country was walking ""a narrow path"" with ""really serious risks"" on either side.He urged people to keep following social distancing rules, adding: ""If individuals, families and firms do not take them seriously the possibility of a second wave goes up sharply.""In other developments, the government said: Ministers would adopt a five-step plan to move from a system of nationwide lockdown to targeted local measures. It would set out a timetable next week for the safe reopening of the events industry and theatres. However, Johnson did not offer any details on how this would be done or on what day it would be announced. Rules signed off by Matt Hancock, the health secretary, were expected to place a 30-person limit on gatherings at home and outdoors in settings not deemed Covid-secure. Recreational cricket would be able to restart next weekend.During a round of interviews on Friday, Johnson refused to be drawn on the conduct of his father, Stanley, who flew to his villa in Greece via Bulgaria to avoid the government's ban on direct flights to the country.In an attempt to strike the right tone before the easing of the restrictions, Johnson acknowledged further rises in infections were inevitable.""We always said there would be local outbreaks requiring local action. This is to be expected and will, I'm afraid, be a feature of our lives for some time to come. But that should not take away from the great progress we have made, together, as a country against this vicious disease.""This progress is the reason why we have been able - slowly, carefully, cautiously - to ease the national lockdown. Without doubt, lockdown has saved many hundreds of thousands of lives - but it has also had a devastating impact on our way of life and our economy.""Johnson hinted that gyms could reopen within weeks and said he would try to get theatres going ""as fast as we possibly can"".In an earlier interview with LBC radio, the prime minister said: ""We are going to reopen gyms as soon as we can do it in a Covid-secure way and I think that the date for reopening gyms at the moment, if we can do it, is in just a couple of weeks' time.""At a briefing held by the Independent Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies, set up as an alternative to the government's Sage committee, Prof Susan Michie, a behavioural scientist at University College London, urged people to avoid pubs at the weekend.""The big concern is going to be in the pubs because there are likely to be more people and less control,"" she said. ""I don't know whose responsibility it is going to be to try to maintain social distancing, but we know that alcohol is a great disinhibitor of behaviour.""She said people may go drinking with firm plans to keep their distance from others and wash their hands regularly, but questioned whether those intentions would survive the night. ""After a couple of drinks, the chances are those plans are going to be forgotten,"" she said. ""I'd suggest, firstly, that people may want to avoid pubs. But if you go, I'd suggest limiting your own drinking to one or two so at least you can try to keep yourself safe as well as possible.""",Newspaper

Scotland will reopen beer gardens and al fresco dining on Monday, with Wales expected to follow suit the week after.Nicola Sturgeon, the first minister, has accused Mr Johnson of pursuing a light-touch approach similar to the ""herd immunity"" strategy in early March that precipitated the first wave. She has not ruled out closing the border and putting travellers from England in quarantine if transmission runs out of control again south of the border.Her comments provoked outrage from UK ministers who have accused the SNP leader of exploiting the crisis to drive a wedge between Scotland and England. A cluster of Covid-19 cases emerged this week around Gretna.Speaking on BBC Radio Scotland's Good Morning Scotland, Professor Michie said: ""There is still a fairly high rate of transmission, certainly in England and less so in Scotland. We do see the writing on the wall in other countries.""She added: ""One really risky situation to introduce is indoor pubs. I think that is probably the top of the level of hierarchy of riskiness. Wales is very sensible, for example, in that when they open pubs it will only be outdoors not indoors."" She said Mr Johnson's plan to open indoor pubs, restaurants and hairdressers tomorrow was ""really misguided,"" adding: ""I think it's asking for trouble. I think everyone can see what is going to happen. Put that together with opening pubs indoors, on a Saturday, on independence day, and it's being hyped up, actually by government ministers as well as others, I think it's a disaster waiting to happen.""Scotland has done brilliantly ... Well done to Scotland for getting this far and keep going in that careful cautious way because it's showing massive dividends compared to south of the border.""",Newspaper
39,Commuters are wearing masks incorrectly;Calls for a national campaign to educate public on how to safely wear face coverings Guidance,"June 21, 2020",International,The Sunday Telegraph (London),620,620,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,Edward Malnick,Commuters are wearing masks incorrectlyCalls for a national campaign to educate public on how to safely wear face coverings Guidance,"MANY commuters are wearing face masks and coverings incorrectly, putting themselves and others at risk, scientific advisers have warned.While almost nine in 10 people state that they are following official rules on wearing face coverings on public transport, many are unwittingly flouting guidance on how to use them, according to experts advising the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage).Prof Susan Michie, a member of the Sage subgroup on behavioural science, called for a national campaign to ""train"" the population on how to use masks and other face coverings, akin to the instructions issued by the Government on handwashing in March. Dr Ben Killingley, a consultant in infectious diseases, who sits on Sage's environmental working group, said he agreed on the need for a public campaign. Face coverings were likely to ""be around for a while"" and ""we're not as used to them as other countries"", he said.Guidelines on the www.gov.uk website state: ""Do not touch the front of the face covering, or the part of the face covering that has been in contact with your mouth and nose. Once removed, make sure you clean any surfaces the face covering has touched."" The guidelines also state that coverings, which include bandannas and those made from T-shirts, should cover the mouth and nose, and be immediately placed into a plastic bag once used.But Prof Michie warned that many members of the public appeared unaware of the guidelines on how to use face coverings safely. Instead, people appear to often pull their coverings below their nose, and hold the front of the items to remove them, rather than just using the straps or ties behind their head. Experts have warned that the front of used masks could be contaminated, meaning that removing them incorrectly could spread coronavirus to the wearer's fingers and surfaces in their homes or workplaces.Prof Michie said: ""Anytime one goes out and around in parks and down the street this is the sort of thing you see.""She added: ""What you could easily have is two small bags rather like those sort of plastic airplane bags. One is for a clean mask and one is for the dirty mask. And you have your dirty bag, and that gets tipped straight into hot soapy water and washed when you get home.""But it won't have occurred to people to do that. I find it quite frustrating when there are such small things that could be done to help suppress this virus and they're not being done. They are opportunities wasted.""The warnings come as a poll found that 88 per cent of people who took public transport last week say that they wore a mask or face covering in line with government guidance. The survey of 2,000 adults, by Redfield & Wilton Strategies, also found that 81 per cent of people supported the decision to make face coverings compulsory on public transport. A majority (51 per cent) said the Government should extend the rule to all confined public spaces, compared with 30 per cent who disagreed.But Prof Michie said ""observational data"" was needed to provide empirical evidence on how different people were wearing coverings in different settings, including on public transport and in workplaces, given the extent to which they appeared to be used incorrectly.She added: ""I think the main thing is that where you have a behaviour that requires some kind of skill, and some kind of routine and procedure to make it effective, then usually it's not enough to say do this, ie transmit knowledge, but we also need to have training.""If it's a question of skills, ie the behaviour surrounding the putting on, off and wearing of, then it does require skills training.""'Where you have a behaviour that requires some kind of skill, then we also need to have training'",Newspaper
40,England 'risks Covid-19 surge' without test-and-trace safety net;One scientist says Cummings affair 'not a recipe for public trust' at key stage of lockdownCoronavirus - latest updatesSee all our coronavirus coverage,"May 30, 2020 Saturday",International,The Guardian (London),838,838,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,Nazia Parveen,England 'risks Covid-19 surge' without test-and-trace safety netOne scientist says Cummings affair 'not a recipe for public trust' at key stage of lockdownCoronavirus - latest updatesSee all our coronavirus coverage,"The government is facing increasing pressure from its scientific advisors over the decision to ease England's lockdown, with one warning that the Dominic Cummings affair has eroded trust in its authority.Prof Robert West, a member of the Scientific Pandemic Influenza Group on Behaviours (SPI-B) that advises the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), emphasised on Saturday that about 8,000 infections, and 400 deaths, are still happening each day.West said the decision by Cummings, the prime minister's key adviser,           to travel from London to Durham during the full lockdown would have an impact on people adhering to the latest rules.The University College London scientist said: ""Trust in authority telling you to do things is very important when it comes to people adhering to those rules. When people see something like the Cummings affair ... that's not a recipe for trust.""West predicted there would be an increase in infection rates and a second wave of the virus once the lockdown was eased, accusing the government of playing politics during a health crisis.""Put all this together and you have a huge risk, and it's not just me saying that, that there will be an increase in infection rates. The government is not taking its responsibilities for political leadership seriously.""This should not be treated as a political crisis but as a health crisis: if you treat it as a political crisis it's all about managing your reputation; if you treat it as a health crisis it's about saving lives.""Separately, Prof Peter Horby said on Saturday that, while thousands of people a day are still becoming infected with coronavirus, lockdown measures may be being eased too soon.Horby, of the University of Oxford, joined Sir Jeremy Farrar and Prof John Edmunds, all members of Sage, in warning that ministers were taking risks.Boris Johnson has announced a gradual easing of the lockdown in England from Monday, when friends and relatives will be able to meet in parks and gardens in physically distanced groups of six.""Happy Monday"" will also signal the reopening of schools - allowing children in nurseries, early-years settings, reception, year 1 and year 6 to return to class - as well as more shops, with outdoor retail and car showrooms able to resume operations.Horby told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""You know, we have still got 8,000 cases a day. We have been very successful in bringing it down, decreasing the numbers because of the social distancing.""But he said it was vital ""we don't lose control again"".He highlighted the scientific advisers' advice regarding the NHS           test and           trace system, which is being rolled out across England with the help of 25,000 contact tracers.""We are entering a period where there is a risk of increasing transmission, but we don't yet have that safety net fully in place. Returning to a situation where we lost control again is far worse than another week or two of social measures,"" he said.The test-and-trace programme will not be operational at a local level until the end of June, and an accompanying app has been delayed by several weeks.Farrar also said the test-and-trace system needed to be ""fully working"" before measures were eased.He wrote on Twitter: ""C-19 spreading too fast to lift lockdown in England. Agree with John & clear science advice.""TTI (test, trace and isolate) has to be in place, fully working, capable dealing any surge immediately, locally responsive, rapid results & infection rates have to be lower. And trusted.""A poll conducted by the National Association of Head Teachers (NAHT) of 2,000 of its members revealed that nine out of 10 plan to open their schools on 1 June, but with fewer children than the government has advised, despite opposition from teaching unions.Johnson has said the government's five key tests required for easing lockdown have been met and schools can admit more pupils from Monday.The 450,000-member strong National Education Union (NEU) has said the date is ""not viable"".Other unions, including the NAHT and the NASUWT, raised their concerns about reopening schools on 1 June with the education secretary, Gavin Williamson, on Thursday.Minutes of Sage meetings released by the government on Friday revealed a sense of rising anxiety as scientists saw the number of cases grow faster than expected at the start of the outbreak, with the experts recommending on 13 March that household isolation and the protection of older and more vulnerable people should happen ""soon"".Three days later, the advice changed: the committee heard there could be 10,000 new cases a day, prompting them to recommend further physical distancing ""as soon as possible"" adding that a ""significant increase in testing"" was needed.Sage also considered documents on the track-and-trace system, with one report from behavioural scientists saying they anticipated ""major behavioural barriers"" to people using the NHS contact-tracing app, which would prevent it from being the primary method of containing outbreaks.",Newspaper
41,"This man knows he's dying as surely as I do': a doctor's dispatches from the NHS frontline;As lockdown is relaxed, many in the NHS are left reeling. Palliative care doctor Rachel Clarke shares her experience working with coronavirus patients, and her fears of a second wave","May 30, 2020 Saturday",International,The Guardian (London),2900,2900,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,Rachel Clarke,"This man knows he's dying as surely as I do': a doctor's dispatches from the NHS frontlineAs lockdown is relaxed, many in the NHS are left reeling. Palliative care doctor Rachel Clarke shares her experience working with coronavirus patients, and her fears of a second wave","Death has been headline news for so long now, I am beginning to feel like a plague doctor. My next patient, an 89-year-old from a care home, is perilously ill. Despite the highest flow of oxygen we can deliver through his face mask, he is gasping for air at a rate of 40 breaths per minute, two or three times the norm. Swiftly, I search his hospital record for a glimpse of the man he used to be before coronavirus so violently reduced him.In my mind, the voices from this morning's car radio linger. Listening to the politicians and journalists talk - loftily, from afar, an Olympian perspective - coronavirus can feel like a mathematical abstraction, an intellectual exercise played out in curves and peaks and troughs and modelling. But here in the hospital, the pandemic is a matter of flesh and blood. It unfolds one human being at a time. And when the statistics threaten to throw me off balance - the unprecedented number of deaths for peacetime - I try to keep things as small as I can. Winston used to work in the local glass factory. His wife died three years ago. He has two sons called Michael and Robert.Usually I work in a hospice as a palliative care doctor. But now, with the wards of my local hospital filling with patients dying from coronavirus, the need is there instead. I'm already wearing my mask. I've pressed the metal strip down hard on to my nose and cheekbones, endeavouring to make it airtight. Now I layer on more protection. Apron, gloves and visor, the minimum with which we approach our patients these days.In PPE, everything is sticky and stifling. Voices are muffled and smiles obscured. Sweat starts trickling into your underwear. Even breathing takes more effort. Behind our masks, we strain to hear each other speak and are forced to second guess our colleagues' expressions. Being protected entails being dehumanised.Entering the antechamber to Winston's side room, I'm dismayed to discover his sons are here. Someone has helped them into their own protection, but one mask, I can see, is on inside out and both men look limp and bewildered. ""We don't know how close we're allowed to get to him,"" says one. ""Can you tell us how long he has?"" asks the other, in a voice made hard by fear.I fight for a second to maintain my composure. The sons have been permitted to visit only because their father is dying. I am a doctor with neither a name nor a face. My hospital badge is hidden from view and my eyes - the only part of my face still visible - are obscured by a layer of Perspex. So much for the healing presence of the bedside physician. I scarcely look human.All those arcs and sweeps and projections and opinions - the endless, esoteric, disorientating debates about whether flattening or crushing the curve is more desirable - arrive, in the end, at precisely this point, this moment of cold simplicity. Six feet away, a father, a man I am yet to lay eyes on, is dying of a disease only named a month ago.""Hello Michael, Robert,"" I say warmly, though doubtful any warmth will carry. ""My name is Rachel. I'm one of the doctors caring for your father. Forgive me for not knowing which of you is which.""""I'm Michael,"" says the brother with the stony edge to his voice. ""No one's told us anything. Can he even hear us?""Everything about this is wrong. The physical barriers between us. The harsh and jarring words that conceal rising panic. The glaring need - that can't be met - to rip off the masks and gloves and shake hands, sit down, read each other's expressions and begin, inch by inch, to cross the gulf that divides us.The sons step aside to allow me in closer. And there, palms turned upwards, chest heaving and trembling, is their father, spreadeagled in tangled cotton. Winston's mask clamps down on skin slick with sweat. His lips are grey, fingertips the colour of bruises. An intravenous line drips antibiotics into one arm. A catheter drains urine the colour of mud into a bag left lying on the bedclothes. His arms and legs, barely more than bones, are twitching and scything. The only part of his body not in motion, I realise, are his eyes, white-rimmed and fixed on the ceiling.The radio programme crosses my mind again. The language of war has been rife during the pandemic but never more so than when the prime minister was rushed to intensive care. Since then, battle tropes have dominated the national conversation. Cabinet members assured us Boris Johnson would beat the disease because he's a fighter, as though survival is somehow a test of character, a matter primarily of valour. The reality, of course, is more banal. People do not die from this illness - or from any other - because they lack grit. Nor do they live by sheer pugnaciousness.I look down at the bedsheets, stained with sweat, and the coil of limbs squirming in fear. It could not be plainer to anyone here that Winston is no participant in a battle. He is, instead, merely the battlefield. His body, worn out to begin with, is being methodically disposed of by a virus so primitive it scarcely qualifies as life. Character has precisely nothing to do with it. It never does in the real world of the hospital where the good, the bad, the brave and the timid all kneel alike before cancers and microbes.In my darkest moments, I worry that the televised press conferences are used to distract us from what is really at stakeI move closer. Speaking sufficiently loudly to be audible above the thrum of the oxygen, I say his name. Nothing. No flicker of response. Still closer. Again, almost shouting: ""Winston."" His eyes remain locked on the ceiling. I can feel those of his sons fixed on mine.In this alien time when even breathing the same air as your patient is heavy with risk, physical contact is permitted only when strictly necessary. I observe the muscles on Winston's neck bulging to drag a little more air into his waterlogged lungs, and reach forwards, inching nearer.Gently, I take his hand in both of mine. His pulse flutters so faintly, it is barely there. No warmth from his flesh creeps through my gloves. I am holding the hand of a man who is dying and who knows it as surely as I do. Behind closed doors, with neither fanfare nor drama, he has been quietly drowning all night.I squeeze Winston's fingers, repeat his name once again, and now, at last, his eyelids flicker. Our gazes meet for the first time. ""Are you in any pain?"" I ask. A barely perceptible shake of his head. But when I ask if his breathing is distressing, he manages to nod. ""In just a moment, we'll help your breathing,"" I promise. I go on, a vital question. ""Are you afraid?"" He nods a second time and in turn I make a second promise. ""I'm going to ask the nurses now to bring you an injection which will help you relax and help your breathing."" A final nod and then, just before turning to his sons, I lean closer still: ""Winston, Michael and Robert are here. They're going to sit with you now until the nurse comes."" I straighten up from the bedside. I note the glint of tears beneath the brothers' visors. ""Would you like to pull up these chairs?"" I ask them. ""You can sit as close as you want, you can hold hands, you can say anything.""Later, when Winston has all the medications he needs and has finally lost that look of undisguised horror, his sons and I converse in low voices. I explain that yes, time is short, yes, he is probably in his last few hours of his life. Suddenly Michael interjects, his voice abrasive. ""I don't want him to be a statistic."" He knows full well - each of us in the room does - that tomorrow's death toll and its televised dissection will include, in all likelihood, his father. I see through his eyes the colossal affront of someone you love - of all that your beloved has been and meant to the world - being reduced to a numerical bit part in tomorrow's headlines. ""He is not a statistic,"" Michael repeats. Then he pauses. And in the bleakness and tenderness of the next four words, I think I understand for the first time the true cost of a pandemic. ""He's my best friend."" There was a moment in mid-March when the mood at work, the newspaper headlines and even the heavens themselves aligned in mutinous harmony. A couple of nursing colleagues and I had just arrived at the local hospital to be trained in how to take our PPE on and off. We squinted up at the glowering sky, dark and steely with the threat of thunder, and laughed at the aptness of the weather.The evening before, Boris Johnson had delivered an unexpectedly jaunty press conference in which he assured an anxious nation we would ""turn the tide within the next 12 weeks"" and ""send coronavirus packing in this country"", like some unwanted door-to-door salesman. He made the comments on the same day the number of Britons known to have died from the disease rose by 40% to 144. The deaths, of course, were just getting started.For NHS staff, the speech felt a little like prime ministerial gaslighting. At this point in the pandemic, the Cheltenham races had just been allowed to go ahead, some 250,000 people jamming into the stands over four days, and schools were still open. Government discussions about abandoning community testing for herd immunity had just been leaked, to great consternation. And PPE guidance for frontline staff had just been mysteriously downgraded so that most of us now were (indeed, still are) advised to wear equipment that fell short of World Health Organisation and EU standards. Meanwhile, friends working in intensive care in London were describing unfolding horrors in their ICUs. ""I don't know how much longer I can take it without lockdown,"" one of my colleagues murmured as we walked towards the hospital. ""I mean, have they actually decided to just ignore what's going on in Italy?""We passed a security guard who took one look at our faces and told us to bloody well cheer up. We laughed and I asked him what the mood was like in the hospital. He pointed up at the thunderclouds above. ""See that?"" he told us. ""That's what it feels like. It's not like London here yet. But it will be. It hasn't arrived yet but it's coming for us. We're waiting for it to hit.""When the hit finally came - those daily hospital death tolls nearing a thousand - the population was, at last, in lockdown. Time, the one commodity we tend to crave more than anything, stretched out in enforced, unnerving abundance. The quarantined population tried to manage its fears and listlessness using the unconventional strategies of baking bread and stockpiling toilet rolls.Our society may be endemically unequal, but no one in Britain is expendableDoctors, nurses and allied health professionals, on the other hand, were reeling. From top to bottom, with dizzying alacrity, the NHS had transformed itself into a single-minded, pandemic-focused, pared-down field service. For armchair critics of the ""lumbering"", ""monolithic"", ""bureaucratic"" NHS, it was a stunning example of local teams working with fearlessness, urgency and vision to deliver high quality pandemic medicine. Operating theatres, recovery areas, normal wards and even conference rooms were transformed into makeshift ICUs. Psychiatrists, surgeons, dermatologists and medical students were co-opted from their day jobs to staff them day and night. In nine days, a London conference hall mutated into a 4,000-bed hospital. Everyone, everywhere threw themselves into action. We were proud and eager to do our part. We tried not to think about catching coronavirus. The trickle of dead colleagues began.Amid all this frenetic activity it took time to realise that something glaring - and terrible - had been overlooked. The whole country was repeatedly assured that although efforts to contain the disease were now abandoned, the most vulnerable would be ""shielded"" from harm. On 11 March, for example, David Halpern, the head of No 10's ""nudge unit"", stated in a BBC interview :""There's going to be a point, assuming the epidemic flows and grows as it will do, where you want to cocoon, to protect those at-risk groups so they don't catch the disease. By the time they come out of their cocooning, herd immunity has been achieved in the rest of the population.""At the time we knew full well - because the data from China had already told us - that those most at risk from coronavirus were elderly patients, such as Winston, plus those with underlying comorbidities. But far from being cocooned, he and the other 400,000 residents of UK care homes were being quietly incarcerated. No testing. No contact tracing. No proper PPE, even, for care-home staff. Pitiful stories began to circulate of care workers wearing bin bags for protection, while begging local builders and veterinary practices for masks. Worse, care-home residents were being sent to homes from hospitals without knowing they were not infected.When, therefore, at the end of April I watched the prime minister declare our coronavirus strategy a ""success"", I felt physically sick. We had ""avoided the tragedy that engulfed other parts of the world"", he insisted, ""because at no stage has our NHS been overwhelmed"". How very cheap - how spectacularly expendable - one human life must be, I thought, if the avoidance of tragedy is consistent with the deaths of 27,000 people, as the toll then stood.Does it matter that 400,000 of our most vulnerable citizens were promised shielding while being effectively abandoned? That for them, even the most basic measures of protection were at best overlooked, at worst deliberately ignored? That the alleged ""success"" of April came at such stupendous cost to those too elderly, frail or disabled to live in their own homes?You could argue - indeed, some commentators have essentially done so - that there was little point to a man like Winston. He was 89 years old, after all, and probably hadn't been economically productive for three decades. He was lucky, frankly, to have had an innings like that. Of course the young must come first. You might even champion another old man's exploits - the charm and determination and ebullience of Captain Tom - while being secretly at peace with the expendability of certain parts of the herd.But to those of us up close with this dreadful disease - who see, as we do, the way it suffocates the life from you - such judgments are grotesque. The moment we rank life according to who most ""deserves"" it, we have crossed into a realm I don't want to be a part of - and I struggle to believe many other Britons do either. The way out of this pandemic cannot, surely, entail the sacrifice of those deemed less worth saving?Like many in the NHS just now, I keep my head by looking down - at one patient and then another. I am lucky in this respect: I have focus. Sometimes I fret that most people don't know how very close the NHS came to being overwhelmed this Easter - how we avoided the hellishness of Lombardy or New York City only by superhuman efforts. I fear, too, that most people are unaware of how exhausted, stunned - shellshocked, even - some NHS staff and care workers are. How daunted we feel as we watch lockdown being relaxed before proper testing, tracing and isolation infrastructure are in place. How incredulous we are as we see government figures breaking the rules they wrote, that so many others have lived and died by.The point of our response to Covid-19 is not to flatten curves and protect the NHS: it is to prevent unnecessary dyingIn my darkest moments, I worry that the televised coronavirus press conferences are increasingly being used to distract us from what is really at stake. That the flood of pseudoscientific statistics is intended to bamboozle - to leave the population dazed and bemused. When you are invited daily to celebrate supersized statistics - 100,000 tests a day, no, make that 250,000 - it is easy to lose sight of what matters.Sir David Spiegelhalter, professor of the public understanding of risk at Cambridge University, suggested earlier this month that Downing Street is using ""number theatre"" to manipulate the message rather than actually inform people. The chair of the UK Statistics Authority, Sir David Norgrove, has even been forced            to write to the health secretary, Matt Hancock, urging him to improve the ""trustworthiness"" of the way he presents data on coronavirus testing.The true metric of success in a pandemic is simple, the overall number of deaths prevented. The point of our response to coronavirus is not to flatten curves, ramp up headlines, protect the NHS or invent mathematically nonsensical equations: it is the prevention of unnecessary dying.As we reel, punch drunk, from press conference to press conference, we must not allow those standing at their lecterns on the podium to gloss over recent history. It is a fact that a whole swath of our most vulnerable citizens, those residing in care homes, have already been abandoned once to coronavirus. And no matter what any government figure implies - no matter how distracting or persuasive their abstractions - this is entirely and inexcusably wrong. Our society may be endemically unequal, but noone in Britain is expendable. Winston, though vulnerable, was loved and cherished. His death was not inevitable, his time hadn't come. He was no more disposable than any of us. Dr Rachel Clarke is the author of Dear Life, published by Little, Brown.

It divides us from the authorities. There's no doubt that this affects that perception in the same way that the Cummings affair did and therefore at the very best it's not helpful,"" he added.Johnson senior travelled to his Greek villa via Bulgaria, in order to avoid the ban on direct flights from the UK.However, during an LBC radio phone-in, the prime minister repeatedly refused to say whether he was ""disappointed"" with his father's actions.""I think you really ought to raise that with him. I am not going to get into details of family conversations,"" he said.Earlier this week, Johnson senior, posted a picture on social media of himself apparently arriving at Athens airport wearing a face mask. The 79-year-old told reporters that he was visiting on ""essential business"" because he needed to ""Covid-proof my property"" before the letting season. The photograph appeared to have later been removed from his Instagram account. On Friday, Greek media carried photographs of him cutting a solitary figure in his favourite seaside restaurant, a bottle of red wine by his side. The photographs were taken late on Thursday.Greek officials, if privately dismissive of the British government's handling of the pandemic, said Johnson senior had not broken any rules in entering the country even if he had flagrantly defied the travel advice of UK authorities. Despite Athens' recent decision to prolong the suspension of direct air links with the UK until 15 July, Britons were still entitled to travel freely to Europe until the Brexit transition period ended, they noted.""We have banned flights, direct flights from the UK and Sweden until 15 July. If a citizen from these countries arrives in a different way to Greece, of course they can come,"" said Stelios Petsas, a government spokesman.More than 3 million Britons traditionally visit the tourist-dependent nation, with the UK topping league tables in terms of foreign earnings. But the brazenness exhibited by Johnson's father has also clearly taken Greek officials aback.The former Euro MP's sudden appearance in Greece came amid mounting exasperation in Athens over ""conflicting"" leaks in London about possible air bridges and quarantine periods.""There's a lot of eye-rolling,"" confided one insider describing the reaction of the inner circle of the prime minister, Kyriakos Mitsotakis. ""There are so many conflicting signs ... we're lost for words.""Johnson senior had long planned to travel to Greece, telling one Greek journalist in May that he had already booked his air ticket. ""I'm very worried that we may not be able to [go] this summer,"" he told the Greek daily Ta Nea in an interview published in the spring.""We are in this country in lockdown and even if we can leave Britain it's not clear to me that we would yet be welcome in Greece ... of course I'd love to be there, even if I had to go and self-isolate in my house I'd do that.""The prime minister's father has been holidaying in Greece yearly since acquiring an expansive 40-tree olive grove in Pelion, the peninsula jutting into the Aegean Sea off the coast of Thessaly, in 2001. He has also sought to capitalise on his investment.The two-storey, four-bedroom Villa Irene is advertised on Johnson's personal website and managed through Real Holidays, an independent travel company based in Islington, north London.With its ""spectacular views of the mountains and the sea"", the bolthole - regularly used by Boris Johnson out of season - has proved to be an equally nice earner for the family, bringing in more than £40,000 a year in rental income. Lower season for a week is £1,750 and ends on 20 June, and then it goes into peak season which is £2,100 through to 19 September. When contacted from Athens, Real Holidays confirmed that the villa, which is let from 1 May to 30 September, was fully booked this year barring one week at the end of the season.""It gets booked up very early, Irene, there are a lot of people who go year on year and book very far in advance,"" said a travel planner at the company when asked about the villa's availability.She added: ""It's sold on a weekly basis. We have clients due to travel mid-July but we can't recommend that people travel at the moment, not with the austere guidelines in place.""Johnson explained the trip saying he had to set up ""social distancing measures"" at the property. No such rules apply to private properties being rented out in Greece.The owner, she said, was ""flexible"". ""He is based between the UK and Greece and I can talk to him. Pelion is a stunning area and unspoilt and authentic, and there aren't that many villas in the area. It's got a pool, you can walk down to a little cove, a little bay, swim in the sea and as I say we always get very stunning feedback.""Asked about Johnson, Matt Fisher, Real Holidays' director, said: ""We are not privy to speak about Stanley's private life.""",Newspaper

Cases of the virus are continuing to fall north of the border with just five recorded yesterday - the lowest number since March 3. The general trend has been a steady decline since the beginning of May.Scottish ministers hope that by starting from a low baseline they will be able to contain any localised increases as greater freedoms to socialise and work are introduced over the coming weeks.The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said that the big fall in cases since April appeared to have come to an end, with new infections steady at more than 3,000 a day.Separate figures published by the government concluded that cases were still falling at between 2 and 4 per cent a day, underlining the uncertainty about the pandemic. Experts said that infections could now be declining in hospitals and care homes but remaining flat in ordinary homes and shops. A further 1,118 people tested positive yesterday, and 149 deaths were reported, taking the total in Britain to 43,230.A report suggested that pollution levels in London had risen in recent weeks to pre-pandemic levels.Half a million people were said to have travelled to the south coast yesterday. Bournemouth council said that roads and neighbouring resorts were gridlocked. Fights broke out between people who were drinking as social distancing collapsed.Dorset police declared a major incident, allowing more officers to be brought in, and urged people to stay away. Matt Hancock, the health secretary, said: ""We all want to be outside and enjoying the glorious sunshine but if you are heading out please do it safely and stick to social-distancing rules. We are making real progress in tackling this virus and we don't want to undo everyone's hard work.""With the lockdown to be eased again in little more than a week, the government is keen to show that restrictions are not being abandoned. Sources downplayed suggestions of panic, saying that most people were obeying distancing rules.However, it emerged that some police Continued on page 2, col 3 continued from page 1 Sunseekers risk virus spike forces are to double weekend patrols once lockdown is eased, amid fears of ""carnage"". One source, who has been involved in discussions about potential disorder, said: ""Police asked for the easing of lockdown to be on July 1, to avoid the first day of pubs opening [on July 4]. It coincides with a weekend of football and I am worried it will be a disaster.""Stephen Reicher, a member of the government's SPI-B behavioural science advisory group, said: ""The scenes on the south coast suggest that Chris Whitty's worst fears are being realised. Folk have heard the government's message as 'back to normal' and acted accordingly.""The ONS estimated that about 51,000 people have the virus, about one in 1,100 people in England. Although this was higher than its previous estimates of one in 1,700, it said it was not clear that cases had risen, given wide margins of error in a survey in which only 14 out of 24,000 people tested proved to be infected.At the same time it thought that 22,000 people had caught the virus in the week to June 21. Although this rate of about 3,100 cases a day is lower than previous estimates of 3,800, the ONS said it was not significantly different.Peter Benton, its director for population, said: ""Our survey has suggested that the amount of people who have Covid-19 in England has been decreasing between mid-May and early June but this change seems to have levelled off."" Reports and analysis, pages 10-15 Leading article, page 31 Analysis Britain is trying to navigate out of the coronavirus pandemic with a wobbly compass (Chris Smyth writes). That we cannot even be sure whether cases are rising, falling or staying the same shows how our understanding of the epidemic is still not good enough more than three months into the crisis. It means ministers are making huge decisions on easing lockdown without all the facts. Despite the centrality of the R number, the government still does not know what it is with any certainty. It uses ten different models to come up with a range, currently between 0.7 to 0.9. This tells us the government thinks the epidemic is shrinking, but not how quickly. Nor can the published figures tell us whether the ""safety net"" of contact tracing is up to the job. With only eight days to go until a dramatic easing of lockdown, the only thing that seems clear is that there is not much headroom for things to go wrong.",Newspaper
48,Coronavirus: the week explained - 12 June;Lockdowns saved millions in Europe... the psychology of physical distancing... wastewater under the microscope,"June 12, 2020 Friday",International,The Guardian (London),1130,1130,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,Ian Sample Science editor,Coronavirus: the week explained - 12 JuneLockdowns saved millions in Europe... the psychology of physical distancing... wastewater under the microscope,"Welcome to this week's roundup of developments from the coronavirus pandemic. As more countries ease out of lockdown, scientists shed light on how the virus attacks and raise questions over the wastewater that drains from sinks and bathrooms.                   Lockdowns work                   Substantial lockdowns around the world have taken their toll on millions of lives and dented economies globally. So it was a relief to hear that the bluntest tool of all in the outbreak management toolbox did actually work. Lockdowns in Europe saved more than 3 million lives, including an estimated 470,000 in the UK, 690,000 in France, and 630,000 in Italy, according to researchers at Imperial College London.Outbreak modellers found that lockdowns slashed the average number of people that contagious individuals infected by 81%. In the UK, that amounted to lowering the all-important reproduction number of the virus, R, from 3.8 to 0.63, the researchers reported in Nature. In 11 countries from France and Germany to Spain and Italy, lockdowns pushed the R value below one, meaning the epidemics went into decline.The modelling showed that by 4 May between 12 million and 15 million people in those countries had been infected by coronavirus but ""attack rates"" varied dramatically, from 0.46% of Norwegians infected to 8% of Belgians. In the UK an estimated 5.1% of people were infected. Prof Axel Gandy, a statistician on the team, said the model suggested ""we are very far away from herd immunity"", where at least two-thirds of the population need to have acquired protective immunity to the disease. ""We need to tread very carefully,"" he added.More work on lockdowns came from the University of California, Berkeley. Scientists there estimated that lockdowns in the US, France, China, South Korea and Iran had prevented about 530m infections. The research came as New Zealand's prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, declared the country virus-free and            scrapped all coronavirus restrictions, except strict border controls.                                        Enter the virus                                      Scientists worked out early on how the virus invades human cells and establishes infections. Spikes on the virus bind to so-called ACE-2 receptors that pepper the surfaces of many human cells, most importantly those in the respiratory tract. Once latched on, the virus gains entry and replicates over and over, until millions burst out to infect more cells.But that might not be the only way in. Separate teams led by the Technical University of Munich and Bristol University found that the virus attaches to a second human cell receptor called NRP1. Like ACE-2, it peppers cells in the respiratory tract, but it is also abundant in olfactory tissues, those that are used to smell.Both groups found that blocking the receptor prevented the virus from infecting human cells in the lab, adding weight to the idea that it is important. What is most intriguing about the receptor is that it may be a gateway to the brain, and in particular allow the virus to reach olfactory centres and potentially disrupt the sense of smell.The two           papers are tentative for now and have yet to be published in scientific journals. But if the results are sound, they might explain some of the disease's stranger symptoms and help to steer future vaccine design.                                        Keep your distance                                      Politicians on either sides of the Atlantic became embroiled in debates over safe distancing. The US vice-president, Mike Pence, posted - and then swiftly deleted - a photo of President Donald Trump's re-election campaign staff displaying zero physical distancing. Meanwhile in the UK, the Tories            piled pressure on Boris Johnson to reduce the 2-metre distancing guideline to 1 metre, amid concerns for the economy, in particular pubs, cafes and restaurants. Johnson made clear            he wants to ease the rule, but uncertainty around whether the advice will be changed has caused chaos for councils and retailers, who may have            wasted millions of pounds on signs and other preparations for reopening the high streets.Prof Susan Michie, who sits on the behavioural science subgroup of the government's Sage committee of experts, said reducing the distance to 1m would undermine messages of how the virus is transmitted. ""It seems to me that now is not the time to be lifting restrictions unless there's a very good argument. The risks will be higher and more people will get ill,"" she said.                       This Science Weekly podcast looks at the psychology of physical distancing. As the world begins to unlock, many of us will be seeing friends and family again - albeit with guidelines on how close you can get to one another. But why is it more difficult to stay physically apart from friends and family than a stranger in a supermarket queue? Nicola Davis speaks to Prof John Drury about the psychology of physical distancing and why we like to be near those we feel emotionally close with                                                           Watch the wastewater                                      With so many people in lockdown, scientists turned their attention away from the most common route of spreading the disease - inhalation of virus-laden droplets from an infected person - to the domestic risk of contaminated surfaces and wastewater. Previous research has shown that the virus can survive for anything from four hours on a copper surface to five days on glass, with cardboard, plastic and wood all lying somewhere between. What was less clear was how often domestic objects and surfaces are contaminated with the virus.A team of virologists at the University of Bonn hunted for the virus in air samples, wastewater and on surfaces in 21 randomly selected households. All were in quarantine after at least one member had tested positive for the virus. None of the air samples tested positive for the virus, but among the water samples taken from sinks, showers and toilets, 15.5% contained the virus. Strikingly, tests on 119 surfaces, including door knobs, handles, electronic gadgets, furnishings, food and drink items, clothes, plants and pets, yielded only four positives. These came from one TV remote control, two metal doorknobs and one wooden stove overlay. The scientists could not grow infectious virus from any of the samples they collected.The researchers are not suggesting that people ease up on hand-washing or cleaning surfaces, particularly when sharing a home with an infected person. But the work, which has yet to be peer-reviewed, suggests that while wastewater deserves more attention, surfaces may not be a major source of infection.",Newspaper

Trashed.""Respect the public, we said. Trashed Ensure equity, so everyone is treated the same, we said. Trashed.""Be consistent we said. Trashed. Make clear 'we are all in it together'. Trashed.""​He added: ""It is very hard to provide scientific advice to a Government which doesn't want to listen to science.""I hope, however, that the public will read our papers and continue to make up for this bad Government with their own good sense.""Prof Reicher's post had been retweeted more than 20,000 times in less than two hours, including by other scientists on SPI-B.Prof Reicher, who is professor of social psychology at the University of St Andrews, said: ""It feels increasingly as if we are living through a Greek drama.""The kingmaker Cummings' fatal flaw of hubris brings down both him and the king...what makes it tragedy is that such incompetence and turmoil will bring the people down as well.""Another member of the panel said those tasked with spreading the lockdown message were ""fighting a rear guard action constantly against government confusion and misinformation"".Robert West, professor of Health Psychology at University College London (UCL), said: ""I am sorry to have to say that as another member of SPI-B I have to agree.""Prof West said it was imperative the public didn't abandon social distancing despite the exceptions made for the PM's chief aide.""The key thing we need to remember is that the reason for the lockdown is not for the sake of people like Dominic Cummings or the Prime Minister it is four our friends and families sake so the rules are really, really important,"" he said.""There is a natural human tendency to say 'If someone else can flout it, so can I' but who will suffer?""Dominic Cummings won't suffer if we abandon it, the Prime Minister won't suffer - it will be the people who we love who will suffer.""That is what we need to keep in mind. What this is for and why we need to do it.""Although we are fighting a rear guard action constantly against government confusion and misinformation we have to really keep hammering home this message.""Prof West said scientists speaking out against the Government they are supposed to be advising ""is the last thing any of us wanted to do"".Prof West's UCL colleague Susan Michie, director of the university's Centre for Behaviour Change, said: ""As another member of SPI-B, I completely agree.""Prof West said everyone in SCI-B, all of whom are unpaid for their work, would be thinking ""very hard"" about their future on the panel.Meanwhile, Church of England bishops have accused the Prime Minister of treating people ""as mugs"" and with ""no respect"" after he defended the lockdown actions of his chief aide.Writing on Twitter, the Rt Revd Nick Baines, Bishop of Leeds, said: ""The question now is: do we accept being lied to, patronised and treated by a PM as mugs?""The moral question is not for Cummings - it is for PM and ministers/MPs who find this behaviour acceptable.""What are we to teach our children? (I ask as a responsible father.)""A few minutes earlier, the Rt Revd Dr Helen-Ann Hartley, Bishop of Ripon, commented in response to a critical tweet about the Prime Minister.She wrote: ""Integrity, trust and leadership were never there; just a driven misguided ideology of power that has total disregard for the most weak and vulnerable, and those who work to protect and care for us with relatively low pay.""Dr Hartley also shared some details of her experience of being unable to see her parents during lockdown.She tweeted: ""My parents live in Durham, an hour away from where we live. My father finished radiotherapy treatment just before lockdown.""I've missed his birthday, Mothering Sunday and countless other catch-ups that would have happened.""And that's a fraction of a story compared with others.""It comes as a Durham councillor called on police to launch an investigation into whether an offence was committed by Mr Cummings when he travelled to the area.Cllr Amanda Hopgood, the leader of the Liberal Democrat opposition on Durham County Council, said she had written to Durham Constabulary's Chief Constable Jo Farrell after being made aware of a number of sightings of the the Prime Minister's senior aide in the area in April and May.She said: ""We are aware that a number of local residents have reported seeing Mr Cummings in the city and county of Durham on a number of occasions during April and May and have expressed concern about the public health implications of his presence given reports that he has been affected by the coronavirus.""Given the clear public interest in this case I have today referred this matter to the Chief Constable of Durham Constabulary to ask her force to investigate whether Mr Cummings may have committed an offence under the provisions of section 15 of the 2020 Health Protection (Coronavirus) Regulations.""New reports from the Guardian and Mirror on Sunday evening suggest Mr Cummings is facing a possible police investigation under health laws after a member of the public made a formal police report. Retired chemistry teacher Robin Lees has reported Mr Cummings for a suspected breach of lockdown after claiming to have seen Mr Cummings and his family on April 12 walking in the town of Barnard Castle -30 miles from his family home.In his report to Durham Police, seen by the Mirror, Mr Lees says: ""In the light of recent information I feel that as well as an important breach of the lockdown there may also have been concerns over Health Protection Regulations.""I assume you are able to view CCTV to ascertain whether this vehicle travelled locally or from further away.""But Mr Johnson has defended his chief adviser, saying he has had ""extensive face-to-face conversations"" with him after the initial reports emerged.Speaking at the Downing Street press briefing on Sunday, he said: ""I have concluded that in travelling to find the right kind of childcare, at the moment when both he and his wife were about to be incapacitated by coronavirus - and when he had no alternative - I think he followed the instincts of every father and every parent. And I do not mark him down for that.""                     Mr Shapps also told Sky's Sophy Ridge that Mr Cummings was ""trying to do the best by the child"".He said: ""What they've done is gone to make sure there's a support network around them, both parents were concerned about being ill, so they've gone somewhere which was adjacent to his parents.""It meant that if they were both ill that the child would be getting support.""",Newspaper; Web Publication

Anyone who is showing symptoms should be tested and if they test positive for the virus they are put immediately into isolation. Then they [contact tracers] trace all of the contacts that person has made over the previous 14 days and all of those contacts too are placed into isolation.""But Cummings's decision to travel to Durham when his wife had symptoms, and the prime minister's endorsement of that, would lead people to think they can decide for themselves where to spend the next fortnight, he said.""How do you maintain a policy if it is simply up to the individual? Because if people who have the virus are able to be taken by car anywhere other than their place of abode at the time that they have the virus, in isolation, that means there is a possibility of the virus spreading to other people,"" he said.Robert West, a professor of behavioural psychology at University College London and a member of the government's behavioural scientists advisory body Spi-B, said some of those who had been in contact with someone who had the virus but did not themselves have symptoms would decide not to self-isolate for 14 days.""It is not a question of whether, but of how many,"" he said. ""Our job now - or the job of anyone who has responsibility for this - is to minimise that and do the very best we can to restore confidence.""He said a lot of people thought contact tracing ought to be run locally, by people who knew and understood their communities and would have more chance of convincing people to self-isolate in situations where they might lose money by not being able to work, for instance.West said the government app to warn people that they have been near someone with Covid-19 was unlikely to succeed now.

The news comes as 16 of the country's leading medics today penned a letter to the Prime Minister demanding he starts preparing for the 'very real risk' of a second spike that is more deadly than the first. They said the Government must pay 'rapid attention' to its failures from the first crisis, which includes PPE supplies, testing and tracing infrastructure and the disproportionate effect on ethnic minority people. The World Health Organization (WHO) warned last week that the UK was particularly vulnerable to a second Covid-19 peak because of its lacklustre track and trace programme. NHS bosses across the UK cancelled staff holidays in March when the coronavirus threatened to overwhelm ICU wards up and down the country.They needed all hands on deck to cope with the crisis, which saw nearly a thousand people die each day at the peak of the crisis in April.The UK government tore up holiday rules and allowed health workers to delay their annual leave by up to two years.[related]WHO WERE THE 16 MEDICS THAT SIGNED THE LETTER WARNING OF A SECOND WAVE?•Derek Alderson, president of the Royal College of Surgeons;•Wendy Burn, president of the Royal College of Psychiatrists;•Jeanette Dixon, president of the Royal College of Radiologists;•Andrew Goddard, president of the Royal College of Physicians;•Michael Griffin, president of the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh;•Katherine Henderson, president of the Royal College of Emergency Medicine;•Martin Marshall, president of the Royal College of General Practitioners;•Jo Martin, president of the Royal College of Pathologists;•Edward Morris, president of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists;•Chaand Nagpaul, chairman of council at the British Medical Association;•Maggie Rae, president of the Faculty of Public Health;•Anne Marie Rafferty, president of the Royal College of Nursing;•Jackie Taylor, president of the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Glasgow;•Fiona Godlee, British Medical Journal editor-in-chief;•Richard Horton, editor-in-chief of The Lancet;•Lord Victor Adebowale.Before the move, NHS staff risked losing their time off and trusts faced fines if annual leave was not taken in the calendar year. The measures helped the health service make it through the worst of the crisis without being overwhelmed.Health bosses have admitted they are limiting holidays once again through the autumn amid fears of a second wave but have denied cancelling pre-booked leave. A spokesperson for the Royal Cornwall Trust told MailOnline: 'Based on modelling forecasts in May we advised all staff that we would put a hold on any further bookings of annual leave for October, particularly as the current level of leave booked was already close to capacity for the month. 'This was to make sure we have enough people available to deliver safe patient care.'We have not cancelled leave already booked but we are not currently approving any new annual leave for October. 'We continue to review the Public Health England (PHE) modelling, its potential impact for our communities and staff, and will reopen leave bookings if we feel it is safe to do so.'MailOnline understands the hospital made the decision based on modelling that suggested October is when the UK would potentially see a second spike. Dr Ahmed Shahrabani, the co-founder of Locum's Nest, an app used by NHS trusts to fill temporary staffing shortages during the pandemic, said: 'A second wave is inevitable at some point this year, we know there will then be growing pressures on the NHS again for temporary staff to support.' Locum's Nest's catalogue of freelance doctors - already used by 25 NHS trusts - has saved hospitals millions of pounds by allowing health chiefs to plug staffing shortages at the last minute, such as absences down to illness, without the costs of private agencies.It has today released four new pieces of software, including one that allows trusts to predict staffing shortages to help bosses plan in advance. Dr Shahrabani said the programme will 'ensure safe staffing levels months in advance'.He hopes the new technology - released this week - will 'improve patient safety without over-stretching the hard-working teams during a second wave'.It comes after leading medics wrote to the leaders of all of Britain's political parties warning of the very 'real risk' of a second wave of coronavirus striking the UK. Sixteen leading surgeons, doctors, psychiatrists, scientists, nurses, other medical professionals and the editors of Britain's best medical journals put their names to a letter to officials.Published in the British Medical Journal, the piece said things needing 'rapid attention' are supplies of medical equipment, testing and tracing infrastructure, the disproportionate effect on ethnic minority people, and international co-operation.They said the Government must get 'ahead of the curve' before the virus rebounds and focus on areas of weakness that could be improved while it is in retreat.The letter comes as Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced that the majority of remaining lockdown rules will be lifted on July 4 with social distancing continuing.In their letter the experts wrote: 'Several countries are now experiencing Covid-19 flare-ups.'While the future shape of the pandemic in the UK is hard to predict, the available evidence indicates that local flare-ups are increasingly likely and a second wave a real risk.                      Reopening schools fully in September could spread Covid-19 from Devon to Cumbria and infect hundreds of families, Sage scientists fear                     Opening schools 'fully' in September could lead to hundreds of families being infected with coronavirus and force parts of the economy to close down again, the government's scientific advisers fear. Although children are thought to be less likely to transmit Covid-19, schools link up large numbers of households, meaning the experts believe a 'surprisingly small' chain of infections could rapidly take the virus from Devon to Cumbria. Due to this risk, the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) are concerned it will not be possible to re-admit all pupils at the start of the next academic year without going back to a much harsher lockdown. Boris Johnson told the Commons yesterday that 'primary and secondary education will recommence in September with full attendance'.However, sources close to Sage told The Times this may not be possible without closing down parts of the economy again. They are concerned both about the potential for schools to spread the virus and the risk of people behaving in a less careful manner due to the impression that things had returned to normal. It came as the two most senior scientists advising the government on coronavirus warned that Mr Johnson's decision to further loosen restrictions could lead to a resurgence in cases. Chris Whitty, the chief medical officer for England, said the changes were 'absolutely not without risk while Sir Patrick Vallance, the chief scientific adviser, said they would have to be reversed if outbreaks began spreading. Their warnings came amid concerns the hospitality industry had been prioritised over education - although others point to the millions of jobs that would have been lost if the sector had not been allowed to reopen. 'Many elements of the infrastructure needed to contain the virus are beginning to be put in place, but substantial challenges remain. 'The job now is not only to deal urgently with the wide-ranging impacts of the first phase of the pandemic, but to ensure that the country is adequately prepared to contain a second phase.'The team said it was 'crucial' that a review is carried out so the Government can address exactly what went wrong the first time.More than 53,000 people are known to have died in this outbreak of the coronavirus in the UK and around 3.3million are thought to have caught the disease (five per cent of the population).Britain has the worst officially confirmed death toll in Europe, considerably higher than countries like Italy and Spain which were hit earlier.All political parties should take part in the review and it should not be used to assign blame but to prepare for the future, doctors said.The letter was signed by members of the royal colleges of surgeons, physicians, psychiatrists, radiologists, emergency medicine, GPs, pathologists, obstetricians and gynaecologists, and nursing.

Professor Reicher said 'the vast majority' of experts disagreed with the idea of crisis fatigue and had clashed over it with ministers.Professor Reicher - based at the University of St Andrews - said in a Twitter thread: 'They have got things disastrously wrong and they should have listened more to their independent behavioural science advisors.'Everything we can do to contain the pandemic, from washing your hands to getting tested to self isolating, has a behavioural dimension.'So how do we get the public on board with these things?

And there are clear evidence-based suggestions on how to address them.'He added: 'By arguing they should be ignored, you undermine the efforts against the pandemic.'And Professor Reicher said there was an important point raised, asking: 'Is one view of human behaviour overly dominating in No 10 and has it led to bad decisions?'He also said that 'people are resilient, that they can cope with tough times if given adequate information and adequate support'.",Web Publication

Chief medical officer Chris Whitty and Chief Scientific Adviser Sir Patrick Vallance appeared alongside the Prime Minister at today's Downing Street briefing as Mr Johnson unveiled a relaxation of lockdown rules. The PM said he wanted to 'make life easier' after an 'incredibly tough time' with bars, restaurants, cinemas and hairdressers in England able to get back up and running from July 4 - dubbed 'Super Saturday'.He also announced the relaxation of the two metre social distancing rule, cutting it back to one metre. However, his advisers warned that there is no evidence of the virus burning itself out and added that it is 'crucial' Britons do not go back to 'life as normal' and continue following the guidelines. It comes as leading medics warned that there is a very 'real risk' of a second wave of coronavirus striking the UK, adding that the Government must start to prepare for it now.[item name=video id=4434078 style=2 /]Prof Whitty cautioned: 'We will be in for really quite a long haul.'In a stark message, he explained: 'If people hear a distorted version of what's being said, that says ''this is all fine now, it's gone away'' and start behaving in ways that they normally would have before this virus happened, yes, we will get an uptick for sure.'It is absolutely critical people stick to the guidance that has been given, it's a changed guidance for there are still very significant restrictions socially and there are very significant restrictions on business of different sorts.'On the changes to the two-metre rule, Prof Whitty said it was a 'balance of risk'.'I think that this is a reasonable balance of risk,' he said, but it was 'absolutely not risk free'. He also predicted that the country could have to cope with Covid-19 into 2021: 'I would be surprised and delighted if we weren't in this current situation through the winter and into next spring. 'I expect there to be a significant amount of coronavirus circulating at least into that time and I think it is going to be quite optimistic that for science to come fully to the rescue over that kind of timeframe.[item name=video id=4434500 style=2 /]'But I have an absolute confidence in the capacity of science to overcome infectious diseases - it has done that repeatedly and it will do that for this virus, whether that is by drugs, vaccines or indeed other things that may come into play.'For medium to long term, I'm optimistic. But for the short to medium term, until this time next year, certainly I think we should be planning for this for what I consider to be the long haul into 2021.'Sir Patrick also said it was 'extremely unlikely' that the virus would 'burn itself out and disappear', suggesting the battle would stretch into the winter and 2021.He said the said the Government's approach to easing the lockdown was 'reasonable' but added: 'It is not risk free. It cannot be risk free. [related]'Every time you take a step to open up there is some associated risk with that.' He added: 'I think we are with this a long time.'We hope that the vaccines and the therapeutics come along soon but there are no guarantees on any of those.'Mr Johnson said he would not hesitate to put the 'handbrake' on if the virus starts to surge again and acknowledged the caution of his advisors. He said: 'As for July 4, I hope it will be a great day but obviously, you know, people have got to make sure they don't over do it.'I know Chris (Whitty) is particularly worried about this - we can't have great writhing scenes in the beer gardens when the virus could be passed on.'This has to be done in a sensible way, people should be giving their names to the pubs, to the restaurants, doing things in a way that allows us, if something does happen, to track back, to test and trace and stamp out any outbreak.'That's the absolutely crucial thing. People should of course enjoy themselves but as Chris and Patrick have said, this is going to be with us for a while. We've just got to adjust and make it work.'The PM added, however, that he wants to see people out and about enjoying themselves again.'I think it is great to see people out shopping again. Frankly, I can't wait to go to a pub or a restaurant even if it may not be wholly compatible with the new diet that I'm on.'I think people need to go out and enjoy themselves and rediscover things they haven't been able to do for a long time.'I want to see bustle, I want to see activity. But I also want to see everybody being careful, staying alert and following the guidance.'As for all the things I'm looking forward to, there is a very long list. I'd love to go to the theatre again, I'd like to go and see The Globe. I'd like to go to a restaurant, frankly. I would love to get my hair cut.'WHO SIGNED THE LETTER?•Derek Alderson, president of the Royal College of Surgeons;•Wendy Burn, president of the Royal College of Psychiatrists;•Jeanette Dixon, president of the Royal College of Radiologists;•Andrew Goddard, president of the Royal College of Physicians;•Michael Griffin, president of the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh;•Katherine Henderson, president of the Royal College of Emergency Medicine;•Martin Marshall, president of the Royal College of General Practitioners;•Jo Martin, president of the Royal College of Pathologists;•Edward Morris, president of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists;•Chaand Nagpaul, chairman of council at the British Medical Association;•Maggie Rae, president of the Faculty of Public Health;•Anne Marie Rafferty, president of the Royal College of Nursing;•Jackie Taylor, president of the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Glasgow;•Fiona Godlee, British Medical Journal editor-in-chief;•Richard Horton, editor-in-chief of The Lancet;•Lord Victor Adebowale.Meanwhile, in a letter to the leaders of all of Britain's political parties, top doctors have called for a rapid review to prepare the country for another crisis. Surgeons, doctors, psychiatrists, scientists, nurses, other medical professionals and the editors of Britain's best medical journals put their names to a letter to officials.Published in the British Medical Journal, the piece said things needing 'rapid attention' are supplies of medical equipment, testing and tracing infrastructure, the disproportionate effect on ethnic minority people, and international co-operation.They said the Government must get 'ahead of the curve' before the virus rebounds and focus on areas of weakness that could be improved while it is in retreat.The letter comes as Prime Minister Boris Johnson today announced that the majority of remaining lockdown rules will be lifted on July 4 with social distancing continuing.In their letter the experts wrote: 'Several countries are now experiencing Covid-19 flare-ups.'While the future shape of the pandemic in the UK is hard to predict, the available evidence indicates that local flare-ups are increasingly likely and a second wave a real risk. 'Many elements of the infrastructure needed to contain the virus are beginning to be put in place, but substantial challenges remain.

There have been repeated warnings that Britain will face a second wave of coronavirus infections.                     'Axe juries to free up courts'                    Defendants could lose their right to a jury trial to clear the backlog of cases caused by the pandemic, the Justice Secretary said yesterday.Those facing serious criminal charges would stand trial in front of a judge and two lay magistrates, Robert Buckland said. He told MPs he would be 'extremely reluctant' to dispense with juries, a plank of British justice for centuries, but it could be a 'way forward'.Sources said it could involve those accused of burglary, theft and some sex assaults. Ministers are keen to clear a logjam of 40,500 Crown Court cases following the suspension of trials in March.A small number have resumed, but socially distanced, using three courtrooms.However, victims' groups, MPs and lawyers warned that scrapping jury trials could create a two-tier court system.Boris Johnson admitted in today's Downing Street briefing that he expects there to be more outbreaks on at least a local scale.He said he wouldn't hesitate to 'put on the handbrake' on reimposing lockdown rules if the virus surges out of control again.

55,New coronavirus outbreaks 'inevitable without robust UK strategy';Scientists warn of rolling lockdowns if government fails to reconsider its approachCoronavirus - latest updatesSee all our coronavirus coverage,"May 12, 2020 Tuesday",International,The Guardian (London),934,934,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,Ian Sample Science editor,New coronavirus outbreaks 'inevitable without robust UK strategy'Scientists warn of rolling lockdowns if government fails to reconsider its approachCoronavirus - latest updatesSee all our coronavirus coverage,"Further outbreaks of coronavirus and rolling lockdowns are inevitable under government plans to ease restrictions and send people back to work in England without a robust strategy to suppress Covid-19, an independent group of scientists has warned.The experts convened by Sir David King, a former chief scientific adviser, urged ministers to reconsider the ""dangerous"" strategy of managing the spread of Covid-19 and adopt widespread decentralised testing, tracing and isolation to tackle the epidemic across the UK.In what was described as a rapid response to the government's handling of the outbreak, the group added to growing criticisms of the unclear ""           stay           alert "" message and said the public health advice to ""control the virus"" was an ""empty slogan"".King set up the independent alternative to the government's Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) amid concerns over the transparency of independent scientific advice reaching ministers through Sage.In a report published on Tuesday, the group warned that simply ensuring the NHS was not overwhelmed was counterproductive and potentially dangerous. Without strong measures to suppress the spread of infections ""we shall inevitably see a more rapid return of local epidemics resulting in more deaths and potential further partial or national lockdowns"", they said.Speaking at an online press briefing to launch the report, King said the group considered it ""foolish"" to bank on a vaccine being available any time soon and said the government must prepare for recurrent local outbreaks ""for at least a year"". The report, which includes 19 key recommendations, will be sent to Downing Street, Sir Patrick Vallance, the chief scientific adviser who co-chairs Sage, the first ministers in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland, and Jeremy Hunt, the chair of the health select committee.The experts call on ministers to reverse the 12 March decision to abandon efforts to test, trace and isolate cases of Covid-19 and replace the existing centralised testing approach, which relies heavily on the private sector. In its place, the group propose a decentralised strategy that puts GPs and local health teams at the heart of outbreak control. The report says the ""overdependence on outsourcing"" is unsustainable.Under the proposal, local monitoring for coronavirus cases would focus on high-risk settings in particular, such as hospitals and care homes, and serve as an early warning for outbreaks that would immediately trigger widespread testing, contact tracing and isolation of the infected.""There needs to be, as we move out of lockdown, a way to bring testing into settings where there can be an immediate, local response,"" said Deenan Pillay, a professor of virology at University College London and a member of King's group. ""This cannot be done centrally. You need your local GPs and local healthcare workers and all the rest of it in play.""He added: ""This is is moving from the national top-down testing we have now to something much more responsive and flexible. Infections come and go, that's how they work. You monitor for a signal locally, perhaps a few people in a care home, and then you take a local decision with the public health team to go and test more."" As a first step, the government should rapidly invest in measures to stop the virus from spreading in high-risk settings, such as care homes and hospitals, prisons and migrant detention facilities, and homes that are overcrowded or contain multiple generations, the experts say.The report goes on to criticise the government's reliance on ""inaccurate, incomplete and selective data"" and confusing messaging, in particular the new ""stay alert"" message, and notes that ministers do not appear to be listening to advice from behavioural science advisers.""It is not clear what people are meant to be alert for, nor indeed what they should do if they are alerted to something. Similarly, 'control the virus' is an empty slogan without an indication of how to do this. 'Save lives' is uncontroversial but without context in the rest of the message is likely to have little impact,"" the report says. Zubaida Haque, a member of the group and deputy director of the Runnymede Trust, said low income and housing benefits must be strengthened to protect those most vulnerable. Many low-income workers who are in jobs that put them at particular risk of contracting Covid-19 are now being urged back to work, she added. Experts on the group include Prof Anthony Costello, a former director of the World Health Organization, Prof Susan Michie, the director of the centre for behaviour change at University College London, and Prof Gabriel Scally, the president of the Royal Society of Medicine's epidemiology and public health section and an adviser to the Irish government.Even with an effective vaccine, the virus is likely to remain in circulation for the foreseeable future since no vaccine is 100% effective and not everyone on the planet will be vaccinated. In that situation, the virus will join the list of infections that humans learn to live with in other ways, Pillay said.""Whilst wanting the vaccine to work and that be the end of it, we need to prepare for something that becomes endemic in our society,"" he said. ""We know it is very transmissible, we know it can cause severe disease, and therefore there needs to be monitoring in place that can deal with these sporadic outbreaks."" This article was amended on 13 May 2020. An earlier version mistakenly said Gabriel Scally was president of the ""Royal Society's"" epidemiology and public health section.",Newspaper
56,THREE OF PM'S TOP SCIENTISTS SAY: HE'S TRASHED OUR WORK,"May 25, 2020 Monday",International,The Daily Mail and Mail on Sunday (London),378,378,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,BY KATE PICKLES HEALTH CORRESPONDENT,THREE OF PM'S TOP SCIENTISTS SAY: HE'S TRASHED OUR WORK,"BORIS Johnson has trashed' public trust and adherence to lockdown, Government advisers warned last night.Psychology professor Stephen Reicher said the Prime Minister's defence of Dominic Cummings had threatened the UK's fight against coronavirus.The University of St Andrews academic, who serves on the SAGE committee advising the Government on behavioural science, tweeted: I can say that in a few short minutes tonight, Boris Johnson has trashed all the advice we have given on how to build trust and secure adherence to the measures necessary to control Covid-19.Be open and honest, we said. Trashed. Respect the public, we said. Trashed. Ensure equity, so everyone is treated the same, we said. Trashed. Be consistent we said. Trashed. Make clear “we are all in it together”. Trashed.' Shortly after the comment was shared, two other Government advisers, also on the committee, echoed Professor Reicher's anger.Susan Michie, professor of health psychology at University College London called for scientific chiefs to deliver separate briefings from ministers from now on, adding: Never thought I'd say this but I don't want science to be dragged down by association with dishonesty.My fear is that science, which is key to getting through this pandemic, will be diminished in the eyes of the public by association with this Government. Independent scientific communication key.'Robert West, also part of the advisory group, backed his colleagues as he shared Professor Michie's post.Professor West, also a health psychology professor at UCL, had earlier tweeted: Conservative MPs and supporters must be feeling alarmed at what is going on in Government. It is nothing short of a shambles with Trumpian levels of deceit. The people of this country are being treated like idiots and I doubt that they will stand for it.'Last night, Professor Reicher's tweets had been shared thousands of times - with other members of the scientific community adding their voices to his criticism.In further posts Professor Reicher said it was very hard to provide scientific advice to a Government which doesn't want to listen to science.'He appealed for the public to continue sticking to the lockdown rules and to make up for this bad government with their own good sense'.© Daily Mail",Papers

58,"Death rates down, but Britain is still worse than EU","June 5, 2020 Friday",International,The Times (London),640,640,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,Tom Whipple,"Death rates down, but Britain is still worse than EU","The death rate from coronavirus yesterday dropped to a level last seen at the end of March as 176 fatalities were recorded.Critics of the government's response to the pandemic said, however, that mortality remained stubbornly high, in a week when one day's recorded deaths in Britain appeared to exceed that of the rest of the EU.The 176 deaths came as the combined number of deaths in the UK from coronavirus was estimated to have passed 50,000. Sir Patrick Vallance, the chief scientific adviser, said at the start of the crisis that 20,000 deaths ""would be a good outcome"".Amid the grim milestones, there is one figure that provides some hope. The latest statistics mean that the rolling seven-day average is at 241 fatalities a day, equalling the level set more than two months ago on March 30 and almost a quarter of the peak recorded a fortnight later.Because of issues such as lower weekend reporting, daily death rates can fluctuate greatly, such that statisticians regard the average as a more accurate guide.The continued fall came as a relief for the government after 359 deaths were announced on Wednesday, a figure that exceeded the official totals reported by all other 27 EU nations combined.International comparisons can be misleading because countries report their deaths differently.Spain has been criticised for a change in the way it reports fatalities that appears to miss large numbers and so artificially deflates its figures.Our pandemic is several weeks behind other countries that have been badly hit by the virus, notably Italy and Spain. They have had longer to get the disease under control after its peak.Even so, Boris Johnson was criticised at prime minister's questions on Wednesday for declaring that he was pleased with the government's record on coronavirus.""I take full responsibility for everything this government has been doing in tackling coronavirus,"" he said. ""And I'm very proud of our record. If you look at what we have achieved so far, it is very considerable.""We have protected the NHS. We have driven down the death rate."" The assertions were subsequently disputed by one of Mr Johnson's own advisers.Stephen Reicher, a member of the behavioural science group SPI-B that feeds research into the Sage committee which advises the government, called for national reflection.Mr Reicher, a professor of social psychology at St Andrews University, said: ""On a day when the UK has more deaths than the rest of the EU combined, the best way to get it wrong is to claim: 'We did everything right.' ""It is so patently out of touch with reality that it lowers trust, undermines influence and makes things worse.""Public Health England released its weekly surveillance report yesterday, detailing its assessment of the virus in the community.The figures for the week to the end of May showed that the percentage of calls to NHS 111 classed as ""potential Covid"" was now at 5 per cent, down from almost 50 per cent at the peak.Across a host of other measures, the report found that the pandemic appeared to be declining or flat. Even so, there were 151 acute respiratory outbreaks, defined as two or more people affected, reported in England over the period, including 111 in care homes. There were 15 in schools, all from a period before the reopening of primary institutions. Other figures released by Grant Shapps, the transport secretary, at the Downing Street press conference, showed that there had been 1,805 new confirmed cases.The total number of tests administered had exceeded 5 million. Mr Shapps revealed that the use of buses, the London Underground and national rail networks remained less than a quarter of its pre-pandemic levels, while cycling had increased almost three fold at weekends.He said that he wanted to use the changes to push forward environmental measures.Leading article, page 25",Newspaper

'The job now is not only to deal urgently with the wide-ranging impacts of the first phase of the pandemic, but to ensure that the country is adequately prepared to contain a second phase.'[related]The team said it was 'crucial' that a review is carried out so the Government can address exactly what went wrong the first time.More than 53,000 people are known to have died in this outbreak of the coronavirus in the UK and around 3.3million are thought to have caught the disease (five per cent of the population).Britain has the worst officially confirmed death toll in Europe, considerably higher than countries like Italy and Spain which were hit earlier.WHO SIGNED THE LETTER?•Derek Alderson, president of the Royal College of Surgeons;•Wendy Burn, president of the Royal College of Psychiatrists;•Jeanette Dixon, president of the Royal College of Radiologists;•Andrew Goddard, president of the Royal College of Physicians;•Michael Griffin, president of the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh;•Katherine Henderson, president of the Royal College of Emergency Medicine;•Martin Marshall, president of the Royal College of General Practitioners;•Jo Martin, president of the Royal College of Pathologists;•Edward Morris, president of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists;•Chaand Nagpaul, chairman of council at the British Medical Association;•Maggie Rae, president of the Faculty of Public Health;•Anne Marie Rafferty, president of the Royal College of Nursing;•Jackie Taylor, president of the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Glasgow;•Fiona Godlee, British Medical Journal editor-in-chief;•Richard Horton, editor-in-chief of The Lancet;•Lord Victor Adebowale.All political parties should take part in the review and it should not be used to assign blame but to prepare for the future, doctors said.The letter was signed by members of the royal colleges of surgeons, physicians, psychiatrists, radiologists, emergency medicine, GPs, pathologists, obstetricians and gynaecologists, and nursing. It was co-signed by the editors of the British Medical Journal and The Lancet, and by the British Medical Association.'We believe that such a review is crucial and needs to happen soon if the public is to have confidence that the virus can be contained,' they wrote, adding: 'We believe this will be essential if the UK is to get ahead of the curve.' There have been repeated warnings that Britain will face a second wave of coronavirus infections.Boris Johnson admitted in today's Downing Street briefing that he expects there to be more outbreaks on at least a local scale.He said he wouldn't hesitate to 'put on the handbrake' on reimposing lockdown rules if the virus surges out of control again. Professor David Spiegelhalter, a Cambridge University statistician, said in a briefing earlier that any future outbreaks won't look like the current one.He said: 'It'll be nothing like what has happened in the past. We'll shut down so fast, locally - not nationally - there will be local measures taken as we've seen in other countries.' The World Health Organisation warned last week that a second wave of coronavirus could hit this autumn and urged nations to develop successful test and trace programmes.Dr Hans Kluge, WHO's European regional director, stressed that contact tracing and quarantining people potentially infected was 'an essential element' of strategy.He said: 'It's well possible that when the autumn starts and we have also the seasonal influenza, there is the possibility of a seasonal effect on the virus - but we're not sure yet - that then we will see a second wave.'So the lesson is that we have to implement what we know works - at the core of the strategy is to find as early as possible, isolate, test suspected people from Covid, and if needs be treat them without any stigma or discrimination.'At the same time (governments need) to track and quarantine contacts - contact tracing is an essential element of this strategy.'But there is no single solution.'                      SAGE ADVISER SAYS GOVERNMENT GOT COVID-19 'DISASTROUSLY WRONG'                    Number 10's response to coronavirus has been 'disastrously wrong', a government scientific adviser dramatically claimed today.Professor Stephen Reicher, a behavioural scientist on a panel that feeds into SAGE, accused ministers of making bad decisions throughout the crisis.It is not the first time Boris Johnson and his cabinet have come under fire by leading experts in the outbreak, which statistics show has killed at least 53,000 Brits.                      Downing Street has been repeatedly criticised for being too slow to ramp up testing, imposing lockdown too late and abandoning contact tracing too early. Britain has Europe's worst Covid-19 death toll, with official figures showing almost 43,000 people have died after testing positive for the virus, and more detailed stats putting an extra 10,000 on top of that.Author Martha Gill wrote in a column in The Times that behavioural scientists 'led the government directly to a fatal delay in imposing lockdown', which was finally introduced on March 23.Ms Gill called for behavioural scientists to be ditched 'altogether', accusing them of being 'lobbyists for their own brand of thinking'. Professor Reicher said 'the vast majority' of experts disagreed with the idea of crisis fatigue and had clashed over it with ministers.Professor Reicher - based at the University of St Andrews - said in a Twitter thread: 'They have got things disastrously wrong and they should have listened more to their independent behavioural science advisors.'Everything we can do to contain the pandemic, from washing your hands to getting tested to self isolating, has a behavioural dimension.'So how do we get the public on board with these things? How do we create a sense of community and mutual responsibility? How do we gain trust? 'These aren't arcane academic discussions any more. They are matters of life and death. And there are clear evidence-based suggestions on how to address them.'He added: 'By arguing they should be ignored, you undermine the efforts against the pandemic.'And Professor Reicher said there was an important point raised, asking: 'Is one view of human behaviour overly dominating in No 10 and has it led to bad decisions?'He also said that 'people are resilient, that they can cope with tough times if given adequate information and adequate support'.",Web Publication

Trashed. Respect the public, we said. Trashed. Ensure equity, so everyone is treated the same, we said. Trashed. Be consistent we said. Trashed. Make clear ""we are all in it together"". Trashed.'Shortly after the comment was shared, three other government advisers, two also on the committee, echoed Professor Reicher's anger.On Saturday, the Government said Mr Cummings had acted 'reasonably and legally' in response to claims he had driven 270 miles from London to Durham with his wife amid the nationwide lockdown.Retired chemistry teacher Robin Lees then claimed he saw Mr Cummings and his family on April 12 walking in the town of Barnard Castle, according to The Guardian and The Mirror.The town is 30 miles from Durham, where the aide had been self-isolating. Mr Lees has reportedly made a complaint to the police.Mr Cummings was photographed back in Downing Street on April 14 before a passerby claimed to have seen him in Durham again on April 19.But despite ten Tory backbenchers demanding Mr Cummings's head, Mr Johnson refused to bow to public and political pressure to sack his top aide.He claimed Mr Cummings had 'no alternative' but to make the journey when both he and his wife Mary Wakefield were 'about to be incapacitated by coronavirus.'The prime minister said he had 'extensive face-to-face' talks with Mr Cummings, claiming his close associate had 'acted responsibly, legally and with integrity'.Following Professor Reicher's Tweet, Susan Michie, professor of health psychology at University College London said: 'I don't want science to be dragged down by association with dishonesty.'My fear is that science, which is key to getting through this pandemic, will be diminished in the eyes of the public.'Robert West, also part of the advisory group, backed his colleagues as he shared Professor Michie's post.Professor West had earlier tweeted: 'Conservative MPs and supporters must be feeling alarmed at what is going on in government. It is nothing short of a shambles with Trumpian levels of deceit.'The people of this country are being treated like idiots and I doubt that they will stand for it.'He also implored the public to continue following the guidance on the lockdown, adding: 'There is a natural human tendency to say, ""If someone else can flout it, so can I"", but who will suffer? Dominic Cummings won't suffer if we abandon it, the Prime Minister won't suffer - it will be the people who we love who will suffer.Adam Kucharski, an epidemiologist on the Government's Scientific Pandemic Influenza Group on Modelling, added: 'I spent this weekend refining our contact tracing analysis. 'One of the things that's always stood out is that for these targeted measures to work, we need public adherence to quarantine to be very high. 'But I fear it's now going to be far more difficult to achieve this.'",Web Publication
62,Look into the darkness and you'll see that... nothing is happening,"June 4, 2020",International,i - Independent Print Ltd,599,599,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,,Look into the darkness and you'll see that... nothing is happening,"» Cardinal BBC2, 9pm ????? » Britain's Coronavirus Catastrophe Channel 4, 9pm ????? .....You can see why the first three series of Cardinal were shown on BBC4. The Canadian crime drama, now shifted to BBC2, has a lot in common with a minimalist art installation: chilly, impenetrable and, frankly, a bit boring. I kept squinting into the gloom (the sun doesn't shine much in Algonquin Bay) to try to work out what Detective John Cardinal (Billy Campbell) and his partner Lise Delorme (Karine Vanasse) were up to. Crunching through the snow? Driving in the dark? That can't have been it. But... I think it was.The reason for all this crunching and driving was that crown prosecutor Robert Quillen (Jorge Molina) had gone missing. His wife, a local politician called Sheila Gagne (Carmen Moore), had expected him home after his date (open marriage; sounds complicated) and raised the alarm when Robert didn't show up to a hearing the following morning. Not all that surprising, given that he was frozen solid in the middle of nowhere, his leg chained to a log.Sorry, I've jumped ahead there.Before we got to Robert's grisly demise, Cardinal and Delorme did some detective work (hence all the crunching and the driving), and discovered that Robert had been dragged from a hotel room and that there was a lot of money involved. The odd thing, though, was that if someone wanted this man dead, why not just kill him? Why dress him up in warm clothes and leave him to freeze slowly? ""He wanted Robert to suffer,"" explained Cardinal. A-ha!Campbell was fairly convincing as the grizzled, troubled detective but this might have just been down to the salt-and-pepper beard and the snug jacket (no one's getting in here, thank you very much). I was less sure about Vanasse as Delorme. She was stiff and selfconscious, as if always straining to remember her lines.There's obviously a bit of a thing/not-a-thing going on between the two of them, which is nice, but perhaps they could get cracking and open up to each other because, lorks, this show could do with some warmth.I don't know about you but when I spot a Covid-19 documentary in the schedule, I seem to turn into Brenda from Bristol (""You're joking! Not another one?"") Having said that, the Dispatches film Britain's Coronavirus Catastrophe: Did the Government Get It Wrong? turned out to be essential viewing. Clear-headed and immaculately sourced, this investigation shamed the Prime Minister.What was really striking about this film was the ferocity of the attacks on the Government. Behavioural scientist Professor Susan Michie said she was ""frankly horrified"" after Boris Johnson boasted on 3 March about shaking hands with people at hospital. Professor Gabriel Scally, president of the epidemiology and public health section at the Royal Society of Medicine, added that he ""was shouting at the radio"" when Chief Scientific Officer Sir Patrick Vallance alluded to ""herd immunity"" on the radio.Later, the Nobel prize winner Sir Paul Nurse claimed that his offer of 2,000 tests a day was ignored. He described speaking to UK government ministers as like ""talking to a blancmange - you sort of poke it and it wobbles for a while and then more or less goes back to the original shape it had"".The most unsettling moment arrived when health analyst George Batchelor estimated that, had the lockdown been enforced 11 days earlier, 13,000 deaths could have been avoided.So did the Government get it wrong? I'll leave you to make up your own mind.Twitter: @ruhawksleyPerhaps they could open up to each other because this show could do with some warmth",Newspaper
63,Boris Johnson faces renewed Tory pressure to sack Dominic Cummings;PM's chief aide to give statement and take questions after outpouring of anger Coronavirus - latest updatesSee all our coronavirus coverage,"May 25, 2020 Monday",International,The Guardian (London),1058,1058,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,Rowena Mason Deputy political editor,Boris Johnson faces renewed Tory pressure to sack Dominic CummingsPM's chief aide to give statement and take questions after outpouring of anger Coronavirus - latest updatesSee all our coronavirus coverage,"Dominic Cummings is to give a statement about accusations he broke the lockdown, as at least 20 Conservative MPs urged Boris Johnson to make him quit or apologise.In an unprecedented move for a senior political adviser, Cummings is likely to address criticism of his actions and take questions on Monday afternoon, following an outpouring of anger among the public, MPs, bishops, police, scientists and medics.The prime minister backed his senior aide at a defiant press conference on Sunday, saying it had been within the rules for Cummings to drive his family 264 miles to his parents' estate in Durham while his wife was suffering from coronavirus symptoms.Johnson claimed his adviser had acted ""responsibly, legally, and with integrity"" and had followed his instincts as a father by travelling to seek possible backup childcare for his four-year-old son.Anger among Conservative MPs is boiling over, however, and members of the public have been sending furious emails pointing out the sacrifices they have made during the lockdown.Downing Street is still to answer questions, including whether Cummings stopped at any service stations en route to Durham, potentially infecting other travellers when the whole family should have been in isolation, and whether he later made a 30-mile day trip from Durham to Barnard Castle with his family at a time when non-essential journeys were banned.No 10 confirmed that Cummings would give a statement and take questions on Monday but did not say when.The prime minister was due to hold a cabinet meeting on Monday to discuss the lifting of the lockdown but plans to ease restrictions, such as partially opening schools from 1 June, have been overshadowed by the affair.On Monday morning, one Tory MP, David Warburton, described how his father had died alone as a result of following the rules, and said Cummings's actions gave the impression of ""double standards"".He told BBC Breakfast: ""People have made sacrifices, this is a difficult time, this is a time of national crisis.""In those sacrifices there really hasn't been the choice to use instinct. Instinct hasn't really been part of it. We've been tasked with following regulations laid down by the government.""Other Conservative MPs to speak out included Martin Vickers, the MP for Cleethorpes, who told Sky News Cummings should resign for having ""undermined the government's message"", and Tim Loughton, a former minister, who told the BBC: ""Has the action of Dominic Cummings threatened to undermine the message of the government and its ability to carry on its work? I'm afraid regretfully it has and that's got to be dealt with.""Other Tory MPs appeared to be engaging in an effort by the party's whips to dampen down public anger by issuing nearly identical cut-and-paste messages asking constituents to ""rest assured"" they are passing on concerns about Cummings to the ""relevant colleagues"".Cummings has maintained a defiant position throughout, telling reporters outside his home over the weekend: ""Who cares about good looks? It's a question of doing the right thing."" He added: ""It's not about what you guys think.""The prime minister's aide faces a possible police investigation under health laws over a claim that he breached self-isolation rules by allegedly visiting Barnard Castle on 12 April.Durham police have yet to respond to the complaints from the public but the Guardian understands the force is considering whether it needs to take any further action in relation to Cummings.However, Steve White, the acting police, crime and victims' commissioner for Durham, will on Monday ask the force to investigate all the claims about the prime minister's principal adviser's time in the Durham area during the coronavirus lockdown and establish the facts.Gavin Williamson, the education secretary, was sent out to defend the adviser in the media on Monday morning, despite admitting he had not spoken to Cummings to find out the details of the trip.He said Johnson had been ""categorically assured"" that Cummings and family had ""followed the guidance and ... the law"".""If you have been given that absolute assurance ... it seems fair to support that person,"" he said.The Labour leader, Sir Keir Starmer, has said in Johnson's position he would have sacked Cummings and has called for a Cabinet Office inquiry.Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland's first minister, added her voice to the criticism on Monday. Speaking on BBC Breakfast, she said: ""I fear, and I say this with a heavy heart, Boris Johnson is putting his political interest ahead of the public interest.""And when trust in a public health message and public health advice is as important as it is right now the consequences of that could be serious. I hope that the prime minister will reflect further today and perhaps come to a different conclusion than the one he made yesterday.""Some scientific advisers and Church of England bishops also expressed anger at Cummings's actions for undermining the lockdown. Three members of SPI-B, the            Sage subcommittee providing advice from behavioural scientists to the government on how the public might respond to lockdown measures, reacted with disdain to Johnson's defence of his adviser.Martin Surl, Gloucestershire's independent police and crime commissioner, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that Cummings's actions made a ""mockery"" of police enforcement earlier in the lockdown.""I think it makes it much harder for the police going forward - this will be quoted back at them time and time again when they try to enforce the new rules,"" he said. ""But I think more importantly it makes something of a mockery of the police action going back when the message was very, very clear: stay at home.""The police had to deliver a very harsh, very difficult message and now it appears people could act differently, so I think it does undermine the policing going back and their confidence and going forward it will be more difficult but they will cope, they always do.""

Researchers studied how three multilingual European families with children aged three to nine years old who had moved to China communicated with relatives back home by analysing their verbal and physical interactions.The team sought to discover if families were able to ""transcend"" their real-world distance by creating ""emotional bonds"" during video calls on services such as FaceTime and Skype.Using recordings of the calls from participants' webcams, they examined how the three families managed to create ""proximity"" despite being thousands of miles apart.The research revealed body language and humour played an important part in improving a feeling of closeness.Young children were found to be particularly good at expressing themselves to relatives as they larked around while chatting away.Swapping memories in conversations was also a good mental stimulus.During one video call, a grandmother recalled giving a bag to her granddaughter as a present.The child was so enthused that she dashed out of the room to grab the bag to show her grandmother, which researchers said demonstrated she was holding on to a cherished memory.The study also found mirroring gestures, particularly high fives, helped foster a feeling of closeness in the absence of physical contact.The study was co-authored by Dr Anna Martín Bylund and Dr. Linnéa Stenliden of Linköping University's Department of Behavioural Sciences and Learning.Senior lecturer Dr Martín Bylund said: ""I hope our study will contribute to a further understanding of how we, as human beings, are shaped by the way we communicate with the help of technology, across geographical distances.""Communication is so much more than a mere verbal affair, anchored in words.""As social beings we will always seek to achieve proximity, no matter what it takes.""A future project by the two researchers will examine how to overcome uncomfortable silences during video calls, focusing on how teachers are dealing with the challenge of undertaking remote classes during lockdown.",Newspaper; Web Publication

""Who is advising on the current messaging? Unfortunately it's not us,"" he said.He said that the ""stay alert"" messaging is ""too vague"" and that ""more precision is needed"".And Prof Susan Michie, of University College London, tweeted : ""Lack of clarity can cost lives. Scottish government a good example of clear & consistent messaging. No spin, no self-congratulation, no defence, just honest communication, including of the uncertainties. Engenders trust & adherence; avoids confusion & anxiety.""SPI-B is attended by a range of messaging experts, including specialists in behavioural change from the University of Cambridge, the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and King's College London.When asked if it was correct that Vallance and Whitty had not had sign-off in the House of Commons Boris Johnson said ""that's not right"" but did not elaborate on their roles.But at the Downing Street press conference later on Monday, Whitty appeared to contradict the prime minister's answer in parliament, saying: ""Neither Sir Patrick nor I consider ourselves to be comms experts, so we're not going to get involved in actual details of comms strategies, but we are involved in the overall strategic things and we have been at every stage.""A government spokesperson said: ""Sage advice fed into the new strategy as it has throughout the Covid-19 response.""Whitehall sources said neither man had been asked to formally approve the move out of lockdown because such a role fell outside their briefs. ""It is not the CMO or CSA's role to approve government strategy or branding,"" one official said.It is understood that, unusually, the Department of Health and Social Care - which Whitty advises - was not involved in drawing up the new strategy and slogan, despite their major implications for public health, and that it was instead developed jointly by No 10 and the Cabinet Office. The Liberal Democrats said that Whitty and Vallance's lack of sign-off ""beggars belief"", given their high-profile role in advising ministers and appearing regularly at the daily press conference.As well as being the CMO for England, Whitty is also the government's chief medical adviser and head of the public health profession. Vallance, a professor of medicine and expert in drug development, is the head of the government science and engineering (GSE) profession.Sources maintained Downing Street had taken expert advice before the prime minister's televised address on Sunday night. ""The government has developed this roadmap and strategy for coming out of lockdown using scientific and medical advice. The new campaign messaging is based on the guidance developed as part of that roadmap,"" the official added.Munira Wilson, the Liberal Democrats' health spokesperson, said: ""The government's failure to secure the approval of the chief medical officer or the chief scientific adviser for this significant shift in public health messaging beggars belief. If the government is following the science as it has repeatedly claimed to be, working closely with the CMO and CSA on all public messaging should be a given.""The Twickenham MP added: ""The new 'stay alert' message is deeply confusing, out of step with other UK nations and it's unclear what scientific guidance - if any - informed this decision. Ministers must explain the basis for the new messaging and who exactly was consulted about the change.""Paul Hunter, a professor of medicine at the University of East Anglia, said the experts' non-involvement was of concern.""Maybe if they had asked for the involvement of the CMO and CSA they might actually have got a message that people could understand. 'Stay alert' is a pretty meaningless phrase that doesn't mean much to most people or to professors of medicine.""If they weren't involved in this key decision then how can you continue to claim that you are following the science? To make such a point that you are following the science and then not involve your two most senior scientists in a key decision like this would strike me as being worrying.

Infection rates have stopped falling for the first time in months due to people starting to meet up again, the independent scientists say.About 3,000 people are still catching the coronavirus every day in England, according to the Office for National Statistics which said new cases had 'levelled out' in recent weeks.England's Chief Medical Officer Chris Whitty warned this week he expected daily infections to remain the same through winter and into next spring. If the death rate also stalls at current levels - with 100 to 150 people being killed per day - then the overall toll could eclipse 80,000 by next March, the independent scientists warned. The grim predictions were made by 'the Independent SAGE' group, which is separate from the team of experts who advise the Government.The group - led by former chief scientific adviser Sir David King, who advised Tony Blair during the foot-and-mouth disease epidemic in 2001 - has been fiercely critical of the Government's response during the pandemic.It slammed the latest lockdown-loosening measures due to come into force on July 4, saying they 'send a message that the pandemic is over - and it's not over.'July 4 - dubbed Super Sunday - will see pubs, restaurants, cinemas and cultures venues reopen. Independent SAGE said the lockdown easing measures are coming too soon because the Government's test and trace programme is still not up and running fully.It predicts that just a third of symptomatic Covid-19 patients are being found through the system.Experts have previously said the programme will need to catch eight out of 10 infected patients to continue to bring daily infections down. Christina Pagel, professor of operational research at University College London and a member of Independent SAGE, said: 'We are adding a lot of risk all at once in the context of infections not reducing anymore and test and trace not fully functioning.'They are sending a message that the pandemic is over - and it's not over. New daily infections have stopped their downward trend and have been level for the last few weeks.'I think Chris Whitty said recently that he was expecting this kind of level to carry on for about another nine months in to next year.'If we carry on with 100 to 150 deaths a day that's over 30,000 deaths. I think we really, really need to keep that downward trend.'Pointing to a 'massive surge' in cases in the US and Germany after curbs were lifted, she added: 'I am worried that we will be in a situation here where we don't spot these increases until it's too late.'Gabriel Scally, professor of public health at the University of Bristol, urged Boris Johnson to set out a clear strategy 'for the next nine months' to prevent hundreds of people dying every day.He said: 'That's what the people of this country deserve - we can't go on with uncertainty and hoping things will be alright.'Professor Whitty estimated that current levels of the virus would persist throughout the year and into next year.At Tuesday's final Downing Street daily briefing with the prime minister, he said: 'I would be surprised and delighted if we weren't in this current situation through the winter and into next spring.'I expect there to be a significant amount of coronavirus circulating at least into that time and I think it is going to be quite optimistic that for science to come fully to the rescue over that kind of timeframe.'It comes after Boris Johnson warned on Friday that 'immortal and invincible' young people are taking risks by potentially spreading the disease to elderly people.He was addressing the hundreds of thousands of people who ignored social distancing rules and flocked to beaches and parks during this week's mini heatwave.The PM warned of a 'serious spike' in coronavirus infections in the UK if people do not follow social distancing guidance before lockdown restrictions are eased further in just over a week's time on July 4. The official number of coronavirus deaths in the UK stands at 43,414 - but separate grim government statistics show the real number of fatalities since the crisis began to spiral out of control is closer to 55,000. It makes the UK the third worst-hit country in the world, behind only the US and Brazil.                      WHAT IS THE 'INDEPENDENT SAGE' GROUP?                     Decisions on the timing of the loosening of social distancing rules will be informed by advice provided by the government's Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (SAGE).But SAGE is increasingly under fire not only over its approach to transparency but also over the advice it is providing.Sir David King, the former government chief scientific adviser, has set up his own 'independent' panel of experts - an 'alternative SAGE'He said the group was necessary because he feared government experts are deferring to ministers and are not 'speaking their minds'.Asked if that meant they were not free to speak out against the Government, Sir David told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme: 'I believe that's the case, yes.'I think there's a very big difference between the situation today and the situation as it was in 2010-11, that is quite simply the permission to speak in the public domain has been changed.'I think the main point I'm making is that an independent science advisory group really needs to be dominated by people whose income is not determined by the fact they are working for the government.'As well as Sir David, the group's members include: The members of the Independent Sage committee include:· Professor Gabriel Scally, President of Epidemiology & Public Health section, Royal Society of Medicine; current advisor to the government of Ireland· Professor Allyson Pollock, co-director of the Newcastle University Centre for Excellence in Regulatory Science· Professor Anthony Costello, Director of the Institute for Global Health, University College London; former Director at WHO· Professor Karl Friston FRS, computational modeller and neuroscientist at UCL in charge of developing a generative SEIR COVID-19 model· Professor Susan Michie, Professor of Health Psychology and Director of the Centre for Behaviour Change at University College London, member of SPI(B), SAGE sub-committee· Professor Deenan Pillay, Professor of Virology UCL, former SAGE member· Professor Kamlesh Khunti, Professor of Primary Care & Diabetes, University of Leicester· Professor Christina Pagel, mathematician and professor of operational research, UCL· Dr Zubaida Haque, Deputy Director Runnymede Trust.

Number 10's expert advisory panel SAGE revealed the reproduction rate - the average number of people each Covid-19 patient infects - is still between 0.7 and 0.9 as a whole for the UK, meaning it hasn't changed in almost two months.But SAGE admitted the top-end estimate has risen slightly for England and warned it could be as high as 1.1 in the South West, home to Britain's stay-cation hotspots of Devon, Cornwall and Dorset. London's rate was feared to be above one last week but has now dropped to between 0.7 and 1.Keeping the rate below one is considered key because it means the outbreak is shrinking as not everyone who catches it passes it on. But the estimates do not reflect the lockdown being relaxed last weekend, with scientists warning it is too early to judge whether 'Super Saturday' triggered a spike in cases. Separate data released by the advisers also claimed the UK's current growth rate - how the number of new cases is changing day-by-day - is between minus five and minus two per cent, offering more proof that Britain's Covid-19 crisis is definitely shrinking. Top experts warned the findings mean it is unlikely the UK will eliminate the virus before the winter but confessed that the R rate is no longer a useful number because transmission is so low. In a SAGE file published today, scientists said: 'When there are few cases, R is impossible to estimate with accuracy and will have wide confidence intervals that are likely to include 1. This does not necessarily mean that the epidemic is increasing but could be the result of greater uncertainty.'Department of Health chiefs today announced just 48 more lab-confirmed coronavirus deaths, taking the official number of victims in all settings to 44,650. It means the average daily number of fatalities has now dropped to 74 - the lowest since March 24 and a 28 per cent fall in a week. For comparison, 85 coronavirus deaths were recorded yesterday and 137 were announced last Friday.Other promising data released yesterday from a government surveillance testing scheme suggested the outbreak is still shrinking but only slowly. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) claimed just one in every 3,900 people are currently infected.

Infections there have risen by 24 per cent in a week to more than half a million, with almost half in South Africa.It took four months for the first one million cases to be declared worldwide - the milestone was hit on April 3 after the pandemic began in late December in the city of Wuhan.But since then it has taken only three months for another 11million cases to be confirmed, showing the breakneck speed at which the virus spread worldwide.Department of Health figures released yesterday showed almost 250,000 tests were processed on July 8. The number includes antibody tests for frontline NHS and care workers. But officials have refused to say how many people have actually been tested since May 22, instead only revealing how many swabs were carried out.It means the exact number of Britons who have been swabbed for the SARS-CoV-2 virus - which causes Covid-19 - has been a mystery for seven weeks. A further 512 more cases of Covid-19 were announced today. Government statistics show the official size of the UK's outbreak now stands at least 288,133 cases. But the actual size of the outbreak, which began to spiral out of control in March, is estimated to be in the millions, based on antibody testing data.The daily death data does not represent how many Covid-19 patients died within the last 24 hours - it is only how many fatalities have been reported and registered with the authorities.The data does not always match updates provided by the home nations. Department of Health officials work off a different time cut-off, meaning daily updates from Scotland as well as Northern Ireland are always out of sync.And the count announced by NHS England every afternoon - which only takes into account deaths in hospitals - does not match up with the DH figures because they work off a different recording system.For instance, some deaths announced by NHS England bosses will have already been counted by the Department of Health, which records fatalities 'as soon as they are available'.NHS England today recorded 22 lab-confirmed coronavirus deaths in hospitals across the country. No Covid-19 fatalities were recorded in all settings in the rest of the home nations. Northern Ireland has now gone longer than a week without suffering a death.More than 1,000 infected Brits died each day during the darkest days of the crisis in mid-April but the number of victims had been dropping by around 20 to 30 per cent week-on-week since the start of May.The rolling seven-day average daily death toll currently stands at 74 and has stayed under three figures for a week. Official data shows the average number of Covid-19 fatalities recorded each day has dropped 28 per cent in a week.It comes as government scientists today revealed the overall R rate for the UK has not changed but England's has risen slightly from 0.8-0.9 to 0.8-1.0.An R of 1 means the coronavirus spreads one-to-one and the outbreak is neither growing nor shrinking. Higher, and it will get larger as more people get infected; lower, and the outbreak will shrink and eventually fade away.At the start of Britain's outbreak it was thought to be around 4 and tens of thousands of people were infected, meaning the number of cases spiralled out of control.The R has now been between 0.7 and 0.9 since the end of May, according to the Government, but experts say it will start to fluctuate more as the number of cases gets lower.                     ENGLAND'S COVID-19 OUTBREAK IS STILL SHRINKING AND CASES HAVE HALVED IN A WEEK                    England's coronavirus outbreak is still shrinking and the number of new cases have more than halved in a week, according to the results of a government surveillance testing scheme.The Office for National Statistics, which tracks the spread of the virus, estimates 1,700 people are getting infected with Covid-19 each day outside of hospitals and care homes - down from 3,500 last week.The estimate - based on eight new cases out of 25,000 people who are swabbed regularly - also claimed there are just 14,000 people who are currently infected. This is the equivalent of 0.03 per cent of the population of the whole country, or one in every 3,900 people. It is down from 0.04 per cent last week and 0.09 per cent a week before. Separate figures, from King's College London, suggest the outbreak in England has stopped shrinking - but its estimate is lower than the ONS's at around 1,200 new cases per day.Department of Health chiefs have announced an average of just 546 new positive test results per day for the past week - but up to half of infected patients are thought to never show symptoms. A report by Public Health England and the University of Cambridge predicted on Monday that the true number of daily cases is more like 5,300, ranging somewhere between 3,500 and 7,600. The fewer cases there are, the greater the chance that one or two 'super-spreading' events will seriously impact the R rate estimate, which are at least three weeks behind.Sir Patrick Vallance, the Government's chief scientific adviser, explained last month that the UK is approaching the point where the R will no longer be an accurate measure for this reason.The Scientific Pandemic Influenza Group on Modelling (SPI-M) - a subgroup of SAGE - use data on the number of Covid-19 deaths and positive tests to work out how quickly outbreaks are growing. Monitoring confirmed cases, hospitalisations and deaths is a more accurate way to identify local hotspots, they say. As the number of people with the virus falls, the data measuring them will be more volatile and affected by small outliers or unusual events. A large margin of error could mean one 'super-spreading' event, when one person infects a lot of others, could send the R rate for one area soaring, mathematicians warn. R rates also fluctuate depending on mobility, and are likely to shoot up when lockdown eases because infected patients will come into contact with more people, on average - especially if they show none of the tell-tale symptoms. But a temporarily high R rate is not necessarily cause for concern if the actual number of infections stays low.For example, if there are 1,000 people infected with the virus and they all infect 0.8 people each on average, or 800 in total, the R will be 0.8. But if 995 of them infect 0.8 people each, on average, but five of them don't realise they are ill and infect 10 people each, there are now a total of 846 extra patients. This means the R rate is 0.846 - a marginal increase. However, if there are only 10 people with the virus in an area, with nine of them at an R of 0.8, and one of them is a super-spreader and infects 10 others, there are 17 patients from those 10 and the R rate has risen to 1.72.SAGE files published today, from SPI-M, saw scientists explain to the Government in June: 'Estimates of R are less reliable and less useful in determining the state of the epidemic as cases decrease. There are three main reasons for this:'Firstly, when there are few cases, R is impossible to estimate with accuracy and will have wide confidence intervals that are likely to include 1. This does not necessarily mean that the epidemic is increasing but could be the result of greater uncertainty.'Secondly, as incidence decreases, R will tend towards 1, and has to be evaluated in conjunction with incidence. The policy implications of R = 1 when there are 1,000 new infections per day are very different to when there are 100,000 per day.'Finally, R is an average measure. When incidence is low, an outbreak in one place could result in estimates of R for the entire region to become higher than 1. Conversely, small, local outbreaks will not be detected. Estimates of R based on small numbers may also not capture change in the area fast enough to inform policy in a useful way.'As the country moves further out of lockdown officials say the growth rate of the outbreak - the speed at which cases are increasing or decreasing - is more important. For the UK as a whole, the current growth rate, which reflects how quickly the number of infections is changing day by day, is minus 5 per cent to minus 2 per cent. Last week advisers warned it may have been at 0 per cent, meaning it had stagnated.If the growth rate is greater than zero, and therefore positive, then the disease will grow, and if the growth rate is less than zero, then the disease will shrink.It is an approximation of the change in the number of infections each day, and the size of the growth rate indicates the speed of change.It takes into account various data sources, including the government-run Covid-19 surveillance testing scheme - which is carried out by the ONS and published every Thursday.For example, a growth rate of 5 per cent is faster than a growth rate of 1 per cent, while a disease with a growth rate of minus 4 per cent will be shrinking faster than a disease with growth rate of minus 1 per cent.Neither measure - R or growth rate - is better than the other but provides information that is useful in monitoring the spread of a disease, experts say. Professor James Naismith, of the University of Oxford, said: 'That the number of cases is falling slightly is to be welcomed. This suggests, that so far, relaxation of the lockdown has not precipitated a second wave. 'It has to be emphasised that no one knows what the safe level of relaxation is for the UK and there is a delay between action and consequence. The virus is here and we could easily see a surge in cases if a mistake is made.                     MEASURING THE R RATE IS NO LONGER USEFUL - ESPECIALLY ON A REGIONAL LEVEL, SAGE WAS TOLD LAST MONTH                     Measuring the reproduction rate of the virus - the R - will not be useful now that the outbreak has shrunk, according to files released from the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (SAGE) today.SPI-M-O, the Scientific Pandemic Influenza Group on Modelling, Operational - which advises the Government on the possible trajectory of the outbreak, said regional R rates are definitely no longer useful on June 12.When giving its estimates of the R value - the reproduction rate of the coronavirus - it cautioned that the figures are not useful when there are small numbers of people testing positive.The R rate is currently between 0.7 and 0.9 for the UK as a whole, meaning that every 10 infected people pass the virus on to between seven and nine others, on average.But SPI-M-O warned: 'Estimates of R are less reliable and less useful in determining the state of the epidemic as cases decrease. There are three main reasons for this:'Firstly, when there are few cases, R is impossible to estimate with accuracy and will have wide confidence intervals that are likely to include 1. This does not necessarily mean that the epidemic is increasing but could be the result of greater uncertainty.'Secondly, as incidence decreases, R will tend towards 1, and has to be evaluated in conjunction with incidence. The policy implications of R = 1 when there are 1,000 new infections per day are very different to when there are 100,000 per day.'Finally, R is an average measure. When incidence is low, an outbreak in one place could result in estimates of R for the entire region to become higher than 1. Conversely, small, local outbreaks will not be detected. Estimates of R based on small numbers may also not capture change in the area fast enough to inform policy in a useful way.'The scientists said they were so unconvinced about the accuracy or usefulness of measuring the reproduction rate that it shouldn't be used for policy decisions such as imposing regional restrictions or lockdowns.They added: 'Estimates of R at regional levels are subject to the same difficulties in interpretation of national estimates, but amplified because of the smaller numbers of cases. 'Publishing large numbers of estimates increases the statistical chance that one of them is artificially high. SPI-M-O does not have confidence that regional R estimates are sufficiently robust to inform regional policy decisions.' 'Much more important than an individual decision to relax this or that measure, will be a willingness to admit error and reverse the decision in the light of new data. This how science works, with new and incomplete understanding, honest mistakes end up being made. 'With more data, errors are corrected without blame and shame, everyone moves forward. Things will end very badly for the UK, if the decision to relax or lock down a specific activity becomes a test of consistency or a contest to see who was ""right all along"". A dose of humility is called for.'He added: 'The government is correct to draw attention to the problem with fixating on the R-value - it is not currently a particularly useful number. 'What is now crucial is that the testing regime is sampling sufficiently to detect any local hot spots, that the individual is supported to rapidly isolate, contacts are rapidly traced, rapidly tested and if needs be rapidly isolated. There is considerable room for improvement in this end-to-end process.'These numbers also tell us that we are unlikely to eliminate the virus from the UK before the winter. In any event the virus has become global, without a vaccine we have to plan for its presence. 'It seems likely that the onset of colder weather will see the virus begin to spread more rapidly. We have a short breathing space to get ourselves organised to cope with the winter.'Professor Oliver Johnson, who specialises in information theory at University of Bristol, said: 'The fact that R is still estimated to be below 1 across the UK implies that the epidemic is continuing to shrink overall. 'This is consistent with the numbers observed through positive tests and deaths, which both continue to decline. There is uncertainty on these estimates because R cannot be directly measured and inferring its value becomes hard when the number of cases is low. 'For this reason it is not possible to rule out the possibility that the epidemic is growing in some regions, though values in the middle of the ranges given are most likely.'There appear to be no particular trends in these numbers compared with last week, and the overall UK estimate has remained consistent at 0.7-0.9 over the last 7 weeks, suggesting that the weekly rate of decline is roughly constant. 'However it is too early to judge the effect of ""Super Saturday"" openings based on these numbers, since any infections that took place last weekend are unlikely to have led to positive tests soon enough to influence them.' It comes after the results of a government surveillance testing scheme yesterday revealed England's coronavirus outbreak is still shrinking and the number of new cases each day have more than halved in a week.The Office for National Statistics, which tracks the spread of the virus, estimates 1,700 people are getting infected with Covid-19 each day outside of hospitals and care homes - down from 3,500 last week.The estimate - based on eight new cases out of 25,000 people who are swabbed regularly - also claimed there are just 14,000 people who are currently infected.This is the equivalent of 0.03 per cent of the population of the whole country, or one in every 3,900 people. It is down from 0.04 per cent last week and 0.09 per cent a week before.Separate figures, from King's College London, suggest the outbreak in England has stopped shrinking - but its estimate is lower than the ONS's at around 1,200 new cases per day.Department of Health chiefs have announced an average of just 546 new positive test results per day for the past week - but up to half of infected patients are thought to never show symptoms.A report by Public Health England and the University of Cambridge predicted on Monday that the true number of daily cases is more like 5,300 but could even be as high as 7,600.                     WHAT IS THE R NUMBER? AND HOW IS IT CALCULATED?                     WHAT IS R0?Every infectious disease is given a reproduction number, which is known as R0 - pronounced 'R nought'.It is a value that represents how many people one sick person will, on average, infect.WHAT IS THE R0 FOR COVID-19?The R0 value for SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, was estimated by the Imperial College COVID-19 Response Team to be 2.4 in the UK before lockdown started.But some experts analysing outbreaks across the world have estimated it could be closer to the 6.6 mark.Estimates of the R0 vary because the true size of the pandemic remains a mystery, and how fast the virus spreads depends on the environment.It will spread faster in a densely-populated city where people travel on the subway than it will in a rural community where people drive everywhere.HOW DOES IT COMPARE TO OTHER VIRUSES?It is thought to be at least three times more contagious than the coronavirus that causes MERS (0.3 - 0.8).Measles is one of the most contagious infectious diseases, and has an R0 value of 12 to 18 if left uncontrolled. Widespread vaccination keeps it suppressed in most developed countries.Chickenpox's R0 is estimated to be between 10 and 12, while seasonal flu has a value of around 1.5.WHY IS IT IMPORTANT TO HAVE A LOW R0?The higher the R0 value, the harder it is for health officials control the spread of the disease.A number lower than one means the outbreak will run out of steam and be forced to an end. This is because the infectious disease will quickly run out of new victims to strike. HOW IS IT CALCULATED?Experts use multiple sources to get this information, including NHS hospital admissions, death figures and behavioural contact surveys which ask people how much contact they are having with others.Using mathematical modelling, scientists are then able to calculate the virus' spread.But a lag in the time it takes for coronavirus patients to fall unwell and die mean R predictions are always roughly three weeks behind.

But with over40,000 new coronaviruscases a day -predicted to riseto 100,000 cases a day - voters aren't buying what he's selling anymore. Holly Baxter reports","At a Senate hearing on 30 June, the infectious disease expert Dr Anthony Fauci delivered a sober description of the current situation in the US. Coronavirus cases are going up, he said, and the situation is spiralling rapidly out of control. While other countries have managed to bring the pandemic under control, a culture of dismissing masks and lockdowns as assaults on people's freedom has led to a dangerous reality. States like New York - once the epicentre of the virus, and subject to quarantining orders by other, less affected southern areas - are now in cautious recovery, but more isolated states - Florida and parts of the south-west, such as Arizona - are seeing disease rates skyrocket.""How many lives might be lost when all this is over?"" asked Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren via video-link. Fauci, sat in the Senate alongside a handful of DC colleagues, replied: ""I can't make an accurate prediction but it will be very disturbing, I guarantee you that. Because when you have an outbreak in one part of the country even when other parts of the country are doing well, they are vulnerable??? We can't just focus on the area that has the surge. That puts the entire country at risk.""That week, Fauci said, the US was reporting 40,000 new coronavirus cases per day. By next week, he warned, it would be unsurprising for that number to continue along the same trajectory to 100,000 per day. As Democratic Senator for Washington state Patty Murray put it, ""126,000 lives lost was once considered on the high end of the spectrum [for the entire pandemic] &mdash; but the year is just half over."" So bad is the current situation in the south that New York has now banned almost half of the American population from entering the state without a 14-day quarantine, an unthinkable development just a few short weeks ago.Despite President Trump's bizarre claim that the US might be able to avoid having so many cases if it just stopped testing for Covid-19, somebody in his campaign is clearly taking the threat seriously. A Make America Great Again (MAGA) rally planned for the week of 6 July in Mobile, Alabama was cancelled a few days before it was due to go ahead, though spokespeople for the campaign refused to explain the exact reasons why.Presumably altruism wasn't the only deciding factor; after a poorly attended rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma, that drew ridicule from those Trump most fears &mdash; people on Twitter &mdash; he's said to be demanding his officials do all they can to avoid another such catastrophe, and a state with a new stay-at-home order is unlikely to produce an enviable crowd. Spikes in death and illness rates that follow any big gathering for the president are unlikely to gel with ""Keep America Great"" messaging, either.All of this has put Trump in a difficult position: how does a reality TV president, known for his bombast and his politically incorrect chants, win a second term when a pandemic keeps large swathes of his target demographic indoors? Whether or not he is, in Nancy Pelosi's words, ""at risk"" and ""morbidly obese"", the risk of catching Covid-19 clearly outweighs the reward of continuing to sit in the Oval Office.The same calculations, however, won't get his supporters out on the streets. Poor people who work in manufacturing jobs have a lot to loose by travelling to a rally right now: their health; their ability to go back to work; any spare cash they might have, which may have been whittled down by jobs losses during an economic crash.. Who cares if they get to join in a chant or two about Sleepy Joe Biden or Crooked Hillary or Corrupt Obama? They've got bigger fish to fry. That same line of thinking might even prevent them from turning up to the ballot box later in the year.Coronavirus couldn't have come at a worse time for Trump. It came quick enough to ravage the American population, and the election was far enough away that the consequences of him backing ""liberty-seekers"" in places like Michigan became obvious. Opponents of lockdown and stay-at-home orders have been proven - inarguably, through objective numbers that tally up instances of human suffering - to be wrong. Those who downplayed fears now look foolish. Proclamations that the pandemic was over and the economy needed to ""get going again"" were clearly ridiculously premature. Boasts about the US being ""the best in the world"" at prevention, or treatment, or testing, or containing have all been exposed as lies or fantasy. And the longer Covid-19 is allowed to continue to infect the population, the worse the effects on that excellent economy Trump was planning to campaign off the back of. One $1,200 stimulus cheque per American isn't really going to cut it.What way out is there for a country that got so conspiratorial it became self-destructive? For years, Trump and his administration have stoked the fears of a xenophobic section of the population, one which has always held government and ""the establishment"" in low regard &mdash; low enough to vote for a self-declared ""outsider"" to ""drain the swamp"" - but now is in full-scale panic. They nodded along as Trump told them coronavirus was just another flu, that it was created by Chinese officials in a Wuhan lab funded by Bill and Melinda Gates. They laughed when he referred to the ""kung flu"". But now their hospitals are filling up, and even their Republican representatives are appearing on TV and begging them to stay home, anxiety etched upon their faces, their voices hoarse and serious.And now demonstrations for Black Lives Matter have ignited a global conversation about racism, and so racism doesn't seem like such an attractive campaigning tool any more; it feels a little 2016. Polling shows that a majority of Americans across every demographic now support the aims of BLM. Yes, that includes white people, those without a college degree, and people aged 65-plus. The ""kung flu"", ""build the wall"" and offhanded comments about immigrants from ""shithole countries"" now feel very 2016. Tweeting out a video of a man in Florida with Trump campaign flags shouting, ""White power!"" also is unlikely to do much good; the president himself must have realised that, having enacted a rare Trump U-turn and deleted the 28 June tweet a few hours later.The legacy of all that lying, joking and conspiracy-mongering spells trouble for Trump. For one thing, some voters who came out for him last time round just aren't buying what he's selling any more. Mary Kirby, a 67-year-old grandmother from a small town in Montana, told The Independent in an interview with political reporter Chris Riotta last week, that despite voting mainly on the issue of abortion &mdash; Kirby describes herself as ""pro-life"" and has strong views against abortion access for women &mdash; she intends to cast a ballot for Joe Biden in November. Losing voters like Kirby should be of great concern to Trump, who he has attempted to court with bible-holding photo ops and even the hosting of a disabled child ""who could have been aborted"" at his State of the Union speech earlier this year. ""I don't like Trump, and I don't believe him for a minute that he's pro-life,"" Kirby told Riotta. ""I believe he's an opportunist."" The professional wind-up merchant may well have flip-flopped and blustered enough to do irreparable damage to his character in the eyes of such voters. The pandemic is simply the final straw.The more serious legacy of Trump's behaviour over the past four years, however, is the uptick in people who distrust ""experts"", especially doctors and journalists. Cries of ""fake news"" have been used to silence honest reporting on the Trump administration's failings; and wink-wink-nudge-nudge claims about ""globalism"", Bill Gates, ""corrupt healthcare guys"" and ""lying doctors"" who sit in hospitals supposedly overrun with coronavirus with nothing to do have made Covid-19 so much harder to treat. Protests in April and May where gun-toting, MAGA hat-wearing demonstrators clashed with healthcare workers dressed in their scrubs and face masks shocked the world; they didn't, however, shock anyone who had seen what Trump supporters were saying on social media about the ""hero"" nurses and doctors Democrats were celebrating and Trump, conspicuously, wasn't. ""THEY HAVE NOTHING TO DO!!!"" wrote angry tweeters when a light-hearted video of nurses in full PPE doing a short dance routine in a New York hospital did the rounds. ""This is proof of the CORONA HOAX.""Trump no doubt realises &mdash; too late &mdash; how serious America's problem is now. While the UK's government has talked regularly about the development of a vaccine, he has rarely mentioned such efforts during press conferences, knowing perhaps how much vaccine sceptics were emboldened by his rhetoric in years gone by. Notably, the US recently bought up almost the entire world's supply of remdesivir, an antiviral drug which shortens the duration of Covid-19 symptoms.Such stockpiling points to the psychology of the Trump administration: why buy up so much, unless you believe a prolonged spike is about to happen? And why spend on treatments, and talk up possible ""cures"" such as hydroxychloroquine (which we know now to be functionally useless, and in some cases worse than useless, when it comes to coronavirus) or even UV light and intravenous bleach (don't try it at home) rather than pour funds into vaccine development and focus on increasing education and awareness about inoculations?The answer seems pretty clear: to walk back claims about vaccines could hurt Trump's re-election chances, and even during a pandemic, the president's interests come first. If he does win, the cost will be ongoing and high: predictions based on the number of Americans who say they would not take up a coronavirus vaccine suggest that even if one were widely available tomorrow, the US would never be able to achieve herd immunity.In Palm Beach County in Florida on 29 June, one commissioner's meeting made face masks in public mandatory as cases spiked among a vulnerable population of elderly people. Residents took the floor to voice their disapproval: ""You cannot mandate people to wear masks knowing that those masks are killing people,"" said one woman. ""It literally is killing people. And we the people are waking up??? and every single one of you who are obeying the devil's laws are going to be arrested. And you, doctor, are going to be arrested for crimes against humanity.""Others stood up to concur, decrying ""TV brainwashing"" and heathens who ""want to throw God's wonderful breathing system out the door"", as well as making claims that the virus could be spread by 5G and that the qualifications medical experts in Florida hold are invalid. Talk about ""waking up"" is very common in conspiracy theory communities, usually accompanied either by mentions of ""taking the red pill"" (a reference to The Matrix, where protagonist Neo takes a red pill to wake up to the reality of his existence) or ""sheeple"".Back at the beginning of May, when coronavirus cases were still at dangerous levels in my home city of New York but barely registering in southern states, I interviewed some lockdown protesters who believed coronavirus was a ""hoax"". As a second wave built across the United States and primarily affected those states where my interviewees live, I took a look at their social media again this week, to see if their beliefs have changed much in the intervening two months.Sadly, it seemed that they had not. ""I will not be masked, tested, tracked, poisoned or chipped to support this orchestrated Covid-19 lie??? This is not my new normal #IDoNotConsent,"" one retweet on Indigo Leo's timeline read. ""Long-term psy-op was to create mass panic and hysteria surrounding airborne contamination to the degree that [people] would stand in line and plead to be injected with the very contagion that they naively believe will render them immune from the regenerating virus,"" said another. ""If masks work, why don't we just give them to prisoners instead of releasing them?"" said a third. All three of these retweets occurred within a few hours on Indigo Leo's timeline.Big Momma Carol had retweeted from one of her followers: ""I just got word Covid will be gone in 126 days, pass it on."" She also shared a false claim that ""the HIGHEST NUMBER of Covid cases occurred in states that implemented lockdown AND the FEWEST cases have been in states that DID NOT lock down."" Both Indigo Leo and Big Momma Carol, alongside others who I spoke to and who operate under pseudonyms online, peppered their continuing coronavirus conspiracies with allegations about Black Lives Matter being either a violent organisation or one that shares values with the Ku Klux Klan, and claims that politicians and media were unfairly attacking Trump.When I asked the New York-based physician Dr Eugene Gu about the climbing coronavirus rates across the US right now, he told me that he ""certainly"" thinks the country is in the middle of a second wave, pointing out that in California alone there has been a 50 per cent spike in coronavirus cases and a 43 per cent spike in hospitalisations over the past 14 days.""As a vocal Trump critic, I'm always ready to make a scathing remark against the president,"" he said. ""But the truth of the matter is that the pandemic would have been bad in the US under any administration. That's because the problems are systemic and structural. The US spends more money on healthcare than any other nation on the planet, yet we are among the worst at fighting the coronavirus pandemic because we do not have single-payer universal healthcare. Fighting a pandemic requires a country to marshal its healthcare resources to help everyone from the poorest patient living in a tent on the street to the richest patient living in a mansion on the mountaintop. Our healthcare system is designed to only serve the rich. The best and brightest doctors in our country specialise in plastic surgery and dermatology because that's where the rich spend their money. Healthcare is a for-profit business in the US, not a public service like it is in the UK, Japan, and other developed countries. And now we are paying for it dearly.""That for-profit, money-oriented system has lent credence to the idea that health-related crises may secretly be being engineered by billionaires out to make a quick buck for those tempted in by conspiracy theories. Vaccines aren't just a subject of debate in the US because of their efficacy or spurious allegations about their connection to autism but also because they are costly, and many families who are strapped for cash find themselves forking out inordinate sums of money to inoculate their children against a seemingly never-ending catalogue of illnesses.Similarly, a disease that requires expensive hospital treatment prompts Americans to want to ""follow the money"" in a way that those who live under universal healthcare systems might not. Couple this with a divisive political environment and a long tradition of rural suspicion against the government and you end up with gun-carrying Trump supporters on the street, demanding an end to what they see as Democrat-led stay-at-home orders.""While there are vocal anti-vaxxers within the community in the US, I believe that most Americans are eagerly waiting for a safe and effective vaccine for the coronavirus and will jump at the opportunity to take it to protect themselves and their families,"" Eugene Gu said. Nevertheless, he added that the consequences of anti-vaxxers' refusal to play ball could be dire: ""Those who do not take the vaccine will pose a threat to the immunocompromised, very young children, and the elderly who either cannot take the vaccine or have such weak immune systems that the vaccine does not work effectively for them. That is the biggest danger that anti-vaxxers likely pose to the rest of society, which is indeed awful.""Dr Michael Rosen, a bariatrics surgeon who pivoted during the pandemic to focus on population-testing for Covid-19, told me he spent a lot of time in the weeks when New York was at the epicentre of the pandemic travelling between people's houses with testing kits, because ""while the hospitals were making arrangements and preparing for the worsening epidemic, no one was there for all the people who were trapped in their houses and potentially sick with this disease"".The work was often ""gruelling"", he said, adding: ""The positivity rates at that point in New York - especially Brooklyn - were sky-high. Around 50 per cent of the people who I tested in the first few weeks came back positive. For reference, the average in the US right now is 7 per cent."" Dr Rosen spent April and May catching Ubers between houses and apartments, and he managed to test over 1,000 patients in just eight weeks.He's now grappling with the fact that New York is reopening and some are making their way back to work. Sick days are strictly rationed in the US, with some having no paid sick days at all. The system means that workers who are ill often struggle on, coming into the office in order not to miss a paycheque; effectively, it incentivises those with coronavirus to spread it, just as the high-cost healthcare system can incentivise people not to seek help even when they are gravely ill.Dr Rosen is now working with businesses to try and avoid outbreaks with a combination of tests for present infection and for coronavirus antibodies: ""We have helped business owners to screen their entire employee pool prior to reopening so that those who are infected could be quarantined and not risk spreading the virus to other workers,"" he explained.""Primarily, that strategy is to identify those actively infected and have them quarantined - with no loss in pay - so that employees are not incentivised to lie about their results and keep coming to work and exposing others because they need their paycheque. Those employees who tested positive can then be retested over time until they are confirmed negative and then can safely return to work.""Current guidelines for returning to work mean that doctors can attempt to protect employees from losing money by simply providing the employer with percentages showing how many people in an office have antibodies, are currently infected, or have tested negative for both. Once the employer has that information, the hope is that they will reassure employees nobody will be left unpaid for quarantining &mdash; and then those workers who did test positive for a current infection will presumably identify themselves to their bosses and go home for the mandatory 14-day period.Dr Rosen is optimistic about how New York, once so badly hit, will weather the second wave brewing elsewhere in the States: ""I do believe that there will be an increase in the number of infections from the low levels we are seeing now, but with a positivity rate of under 2 per cent,"" he told me. ""I don't believe we will see a return to exponential growth that we are currently seeing in states like Arizona or Florida.""He believes that the problem will now lie with an out-of-control spread among southern states, exacerbated by the political beliefs of that population. ""On New York's streets there is near-total compliance with mask wearing, at least in Manhattan and more densely populated boroughs,"" he said. ""Inside dining will likely remain outlawed throughout the summer.""Dr Gu echoed that idea, saying that he thought indoor dining in particular was what had caused those skyrocketing rates elsewhere. Because of New York's strict local laws, they concurred, the risk of southerners bringing coronavirus back into New York is fairly low. ""All that,"" said Dr Rosen, ""and the lack of MAGA devotees eschewing masks and coughing on our babies to show they won't be controlled by the 'deep state' should help us get through the summer without things needing to be shut down again.""",Newspaper
74,Next step: two households of any size can reunite,"June 13, 2020 Saturday",International,The Times (London),531,531,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,Chris Smyth,Next step: two households of any size can reunite,"Grandparents and other relatives who miss out on the introduction of ""support bubbles"" today should be allowed to reunite with their families next, government advisers have said.The next phase of social easing should allow two households of any size to form a bubble, scientists have recommended, provided that no surge in coronavirus infections results from the more limited new freedom for people living on their own.However, behavioural scientists have advised ministers to approach bubbles with a ""high degree of caution"" because of the risk of increasing infections as more people come into contact.The government's behavioural science advisory group also said that women, and particularly women from ethnic minorities, may lose out because of pressure to care for elderly relatives or other people's children. Allowing social bubbles may create ""friction and fragmentation"" as people are forced to make tricky decisions about which households to form exclusive partnerships with, a briefing paper said.From today adults who live alone and single parents with young children will be able to pair up with one other household to form a ""support bubble"". Boris Johnson said the change was a targeted policy to help those who were ""particularly lonely"", after polling found that a quarter of adults have been lonely, up from a tenth before the lockdown. The prime minister insisted that the change was ""emphatically not"" a green light for wider social mixing.However, papers published yesterday by the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) showed that the policy was designed as a first step towards bigger bubbles if cases of the virus continue to fall. Eight million people in the UK live alone.A month ago the behavioural science unit recommended a ""phased introduction of 'bubbles' "", to be accompanied by safer working environments and effective contact tracing. Scientists have recommended moving to ""phase two, two households joining together regardless of number of members"" provided that there are ""no epidemiological adverse effects"" from the smaller bubbles.This ""would enable grandparents, or couples, or a lone parent and child to link up with a larger household for various kinds of support"", they said.Those who may secretly regret being forced into a bubble with an in-law who happens to live alone and so cannot team up with another household can take heart. Phase 3 will allow ""households who had added lone members to also add a third, larger household"".Scientists have warned that because caring responsibilities fall more on women, ""extension of networks might bring even more work of this kind to women"". There is also concern that ""individuals may push for their needs to be met through social networks at the cost of other individuals. This is likely to disadvantage women, children and young adults,"" they said.Epidemiologists on the government's modelling committee estimated that bubbles of small households would have a ""a measurable but not particularly large effect"" on the reproductive rate of the virus, known as R. However, they added that bubbles involving larger households would be more likely to push the R value above the danger figure of 1.",Newspaper
75,Chancellor's stock peaks with 'nudge' summer statement;Sunak wins plaudits for taking drastic measures to revive UK's pandemic-stricken economySunak unveils stamp duty holiday and hospitality VAT cutStamp duty: what is it and what has the chancellor changed?,"July 8, 2020 Wednesday",International,The Guardian (London),815,815,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,Larry Elliott Economics editor,Chancellor's stock peaks with 'nudge' summer statementSunak wins plaudits for taking drastic measures to revive UK's pandemic-stricken economySunak unveils stamp duty holiday and hospitality VAT cutStamp duty: what is it and what has the chancellor changed?,"The Covid-19 crisis has been good for Rishi Sunak's reputation. While other cabinet members have floundered around, the chancellor has won plaudits for his handling of the economy during its pandemic-enforced lockdown.That's not entirely surprising because Sunak's main job for the past few months has been to shower Britain with cash. Yes, he has faced pressure from those that have not been benefited from the state's largesse - freelancers and some self-employed workers, for example - but the chancellor's stock has risen.Judging by the reaction to his mini budget on Wednesday, Sunak's share price has peaked. But for the first time in his brief spell running the Treasury, the chancellor has come in for some flak. To be sure, there was a welcome for some of the measures, but there was also an undercurrent of unease that the package as a whole was insufficiently bold given the threat to jobs in the coming months.Take the response from Carolyn Fairbairn, the director general of the employers' organisation, the CBI. Fairbairn said just as the challenge in the spring had been to flatten the infection curve so the task now was to flatten the unemployment curve. Her welcome for the chancellor's job creation measures came with a ""but"" attached.""Many viable firms are facing maximum jeopardy right now"", she said. ""The job retention bonus will help firms protect jobs. But with nearly 70% of firms running low on cash, and three in four reporting lack of demand, more immediate direct support for firms, from grants to further business rates relief, is still urgently needed.""Sunak seems to have taken his inspiration from nudge theory, a branch of economics that has been all the rage in recent years. The idea is that small decisions by governments can result in big changes in consumer behaviour, or in this case that people nervous about going out for a pizza can be persuaded to do so with a big shove.The most nudge-like of all the measures was Sunak's ""eat out to help out"" scheme, which gives anybody eating out between Monday and Wednesday in August 50% off their bill up to a maximum of £10 per head.Whether this proposal will be enough to lure people out to cafes and restaurants remains to be seen. Neil Wilson, an analyst at the financial trading platform Markets.com, described it as the ""kind of back-of-fag-packet policy idea dreamt up on the hoof by Ollie Reeder in The Thick of It"". Anti-poverty campaigners said the £500m cost of the scheme would be better spent boosting welfare payments so that poor families could put food on the table.A more substantial measure was the decision to cut VAT for businesses in the hospitality and tourism sectors from 20% to 5% until January. Again, the plan is to provide an incentive for households to go out and spend rather than save over the coming months. Worryingly for the government's hopes of a V-shaped economic recovery, the expected rush to the pub after last week's reopening in England failed to materialise.Given that the chancellor has made the VAT cut time limited, there is a risk that spending will fall sharply when prices go back up next spring. This, though, is a gamble Sunak thinks is worth taking. The hope is that the economy will be through the worst by early 2021 and that the hospitality and tourism sectors will be able to cope by then.It is the next few months, the period when the furlough scheme is being wound down, that is critical. The evidence from other countries is that many see an initial burst in activity as lockdown restrictions are eased but the economy then enters a second phase when the recovery slows down.The UK is about to enter this period, and the justifiable fear of the government is that businesses will start to lay off staff in large numbers between now and the end of the furlough scheme in October. Sunak has resisted calls to extend the furlough scheme or make it sector specific, but instead is offering businesses a £1,000 job retention bonus for every worker kept on until January.Here, the issue is one of scale. Since the lockdown began businesses have been receiving up to £2,500 a month in wage subsidy per employee furloughed. For many of them a £1,000 bonus will simply not cut it. Fighting a pandemic does not come cheap. There were no official forecasts yesterday but the government is on course to borrow around £350bn this year. That figure may well rise. If, as seems entirely possible, unemployment rises sharply in the months ahead, there will be more stimulus in Sunak's autumn budget.The chancellor thinks it would be more expensive to have mass unemployment than to support the economy and he is right about that. It might take more than £30bn to do the trick, that's all. This article was amended on 10 July 2020. The VAT cut for businesses in the hospitality and tourism sectors from 20% to 5% is until January, not March as an earlier version said.",Newspaper

A Conservative voter and enthusiastic Leaver, to my Remain-voting, Labour member self.Our conversation began as all video calls must - ""can you hear me""Raja was 100 miles away in Leicester, living with his mum who had moved in with him so she wouldn't be alone during lockdown.He was wearing a smart suit, after a day at work via zoom. I was in a t-shirt, full of euphoric relief that the thing had worked.To kick off, we tackled one of the questions set by the Behavioural Insights Team for Britain Connects. Who would we invite to a zoom dinner party and whyRaja went for Napoleon Hill, the Depression era author of 'Think and Grow Rich'. I went for Nelson Mandela. So far so polarised.But I liked Raja's second choice, Aldous Huxley. Raja wanted to ask the author what he made of our Brave New World. It's one of my favourite books, and I'd have been fascinated to meet him.Born in Hong Kong, where some of his ancestors had arrived from India, Raja has a very global perspective. We had a fascinating chat about Brexit. Raja is studying EU law and is passionate about the lack of accountability in the way UK laws were governed from Brussels. He had even campaigned door to door for Leave in his local area.But he shared my concerns about racism during the time of the campaign and had even experienced it, ""as if they hadn't noticed I'm not white"".I've been as profoundly moved by this year's project over Whereby - a videocall platform - as I was by last year's Britain Talks, where people were able to meet in person. For Britain Connects, some pairs matched by our platform gave us the immense privilege of listening in to their meetings, giving us an extraordinary window through which to view people's differing experiences of the coronavirus. All of us are having very different experiences of the pandemic - whether we are key workers, working from home, home-schooling, furloughed, unemployed, shielding, young or old, too busy or too isolated.From accountants to zumba teachers, farmers to artists, this was a chance to hear about someone else's unique experience of the last nine weeks.As Harish Sharma, 61, said to his match Janina Bacon: ""Before this we wouldn't have got involved in something like this.""You don't know me from Adam, I don't know you -but here we are. I didn't know what to expect... and it's great.""One of the interesting things about the project has been how many people have been prepared to talk about loneliness, and often not in ways we might expect.The loneliness of the nurse who spends days with intubated unconscious patients.The isolation of the supermarket worker behind glass, or the care-worker trapped behind a mask.And it has been moving to hear from disabled and elderly people, impacted by shielding to such a degree that many have seen no one for almost three months.Diane Eubanks, 53, from urban Leeds, met Susan Wilkes, 49 from a rural village in Oxfordshire through Britain Connects.Diane voted Remain in the 2016 referendum, while Susan voted Leave. Yet both shared very similar experiences of lockdown as shielding disabled women who live alone.Diane asked Susan, when she last felt lonely. ""Probably most of the time since lockdown,"" Susan said. ""I usually meet friends for lunch every day. Recently I started to see a close friend of mine who is blind, so I can drop food items off for him from my own food parcels.""Afterwards Susan said she'd like to give Diane a hug. ""I am so glad I have taken part in Britain Connects because I have made a new friend,"" Diane said.""Can you hear me"" is the modern zoom phenomenon summed up. But it's also how we all feel. We need to be heard by each other, and that also involves being able to listen.Of course, Raja and I already had one thing in common. We'd both been prepared to take a leap of faith into the unknown to meet each other.""The coronavirus is changing us,"" Raja said. ""Look at what we're doing now. I would never have done this normally. I would love to do lots of these meetings and meet all kinds of people who are experiencing life and lockdown differently. People need to meet people who are different. We need to come together somehow.""For me and my colleagues who have spent weeks under lockdown working to connect Britain, this was all we needed to hear.                     So many hundreds of people signed up after our deadline, we have now decided to do a second round of Britain Connects in early June - also re-matching anyone who tried to take part but their partner did not show up.

77,"Untested messages can harm our health;Poor communications can be a greater risk to the public than what they're trying to protect against, writes Prof Peter Ayton","May 26, 2020 Tuesday",International,The Guardian (London),204,204,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,Letters,"Untested messages can harm our healthPoor communications can be a greater risk to the public than what they're trying to protect against, writes Prof Peter Ayton","Lee de Wit ( Nudge theory could heal Brexit Britain's divide over lockdown, 20 May) is persuasive that telling people to follow common sense is likely to prove a lot less effective than more specific interventions, and also that engaging with the diverse attitudes causing varying responses to communications is key to effective message design.But nudge ""theory"" is a slight misnomer - it offers only imprecise ideas about types of message likely to be more effective. Instead, nudge advocates have always endorsed the use of randomised controlled trials to identify effective messages.By causing undue alarm or complacency, poor communications can have a greater public health impact than the risks that they attempt to describe. Moreover, as intuitions about the effects of messages on behaviour cannot be trusted, there is no substitute for empirical validation that can be done quickly and cheaply. Accordingly, it should be considered no more acceptable to release an untested pandemic communication than an untested drug.

78,Tied up in knots;Boris Johnson is being compared to Theresa May by MPs fed up with his indecision over the two-metre rule and renewed reliance on Dominic Cummings,"June 14, 2020 Sunday",International,The Sunday Times (London),2022,2022,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,TIM SHIPMAN,Tied up in knotsBoris Johnson is being compared to Theresa May by MPs fed up with his indecision over the two-metre rule and renewed reliance on Dominic Cummings,"TIM SHIPMAN Political Editor Two calls summed up one of Boris Johnson's most difficult weeks as prime minister. Early last week a senior member of Downing Street staff phoned a friend and said: ""The worry is that [Chris] Whitty and [Sir Patrick] Vallance could resign."" The chief medical officer and the chief scientific adviser - often seen flanking the prime minister at the coronavirus press conferences - had not made a threat to walk, but they were, to use a whips' phrase, ""on resignation watch"". ""Their posture is much more aggressive,"" a senior Tory confided.Johnson's team would have been more concerned still if they had known the details of a recent conversation between a senior member of the Sage advisory group of scientists and a representative of one of Britain's leading business groups. ""We have had enough of being treated as human shields by the prime minister,"" the scientist complained.The shields were picking up swords of their own in response to a growing drumbeat that Johnson wants to cut the social distancing rules in half from two metres to one metre to open up the economy.The ""Band of Brothers"" mood at the top, when politicians and experts worked together to tackle the health crisis, has fractured, now that Johnson has competing concerns about economic meltdown. Members of Sage say they were happy to go along with ""phase two"" of the government's road map, the gradual loosening that will see non-essential shops reopen tomorrow. But on Wednesday, Vallance made clear that any reduction in the two-metre guidance would be for politicians to decide. There would be no explicit support for further loosening.The danger for the prime minister is that the Sage committee puts down its objections in black and white. ""It is getting to the stage where they are threatening to minute their opposition to moving from two metres,"" a source said. ""Those minutes get formally released.""A week ago Johnson struck a deal with his chancellor, Rishi Sunak, that he would push to prioritise the economy. But sources say that within hours of that meeting there was another with aides, involving heated exchanges, in which Johnson was persuaded to move more cautiously.Add to that a screeching U-turn on the opening of schools on Tuesday and the growing culture war over Black Lives Matter, where Downing Street struggled to balance respect for the wounded feelings of black Britons with trumpeting law and order to please their base, and you have a perfect storm for Downing Street that has left ministers enraged and Conservative MPs jittery at the ""lack of grip"" in No 10.In an ominous development, three senior Tories - a cabinet minister, a former No 10 aide and a former cabinet - all compared Johnson to Theresa May, unprompted.""Back in the day, people said Theresa was paralysed and couldn't make a decision - it's like that with Boris,"" the former aide said. ""This flip-flopping and malaise comes from the very top. The likes of Rishi and Matt [Hancock, the health secretary] are pulling their hair out.""These concerns are shared by quite senior people in No 10. Even one close Johnson ally said: ""He seems to have gone back and forth a lot this week. He just can't make his mind up.""Ministers were furious that the schools U-turn and Johnson's announcement on Wednesday that one-person households could ""bubble"" with another household was not even discussed in cabinet. One cabinet minister said: ""What the f*** is going on, why has no one got a grip on this?"" Another cabinet source said more preparations were needed to salvage schools: ""There is zero chance of social distancing in schools. You either accept that or you go and find alternate locations, just as we did with the Nightingale hospitals. There seem to be zero plans for that.""We have a majority of 80, you can hire whoever you want. You can spend any amount of money. You can hire management consultants, specialists, pay Amazon to come in and deliver tests. There are no excuses.""The bubble announcement was proof of the continuing influence of Dominic Cummings, Johnson's senior adviser, whose powers, some had claimed, were waning. The policy came about when a single parent called Ella contacted Cummings and his wife Mary Wakefield to explain her own ""exhaustion"", ""worries"" and sense of isolation after it emerged that they had gone to Durham during the lockdown.To her surprise, Wakefield emailed back from ""Mary and Dom"" saying work was being done on bubbles, adding: ""I wonder if it might make sense if single parents were allowed to do that asap?"" On Monday, Cummings got a No 10 policy adviser to call the mother, and by Wednesday the announcement was made. ""Any suggestion that the Barnard Castle thing has clipped Dom's wings is just not true,"" a Tory adviser said.Even the bubble plan was seen by some as proof that Johnson's team was more comfortable dealing with the lifestyle issues raised by Covid-19 than the economic ones. ""When they focus on opening up, they focus on the social side of things: when you can see your mum, rather than when you can get to work,"" a Tory adviser said.Allies point out that Cummings has been sceptical about Treasury predictions of doom for years. ""Economic warnings and scare stories are the thing that that group pushes against the most,"" one said. ""Dom didn't believe warnings about economic catastrophe if we failed to join the euro, or if we left the EU, or if we had a no-deal Brexit.""Even last week vote leavers in No 10 are said to have mocked Treasury officials for privately predicting that GDP would fall by 30% in April. The final figure was 20.4%, the worst on record. Taking March and April together the economy shrunk by 25%, unimaginable numbers in a normal recession.The figures horrify MPs and ministers. ""If we come out of this with the worst death rate and the worst economic crash, that's a pretty terrible double header,"" a senior Conservative said.Cummings remains a brake on moves to open up lockdown too quickly. He has been studying the way infection rates are picking up in American states where lockdown is lifting. ""Do you really think Boris could survive opening and then shutting again in a month?"" one ally asked. ""His reputation would be in tatters.""A cabinet source added: ""The worst nightmare is a second wave timed to coincide with winter and a seasonal flu outbreak."" References to another ""winter of discontent"" have been banned in Whitehall. In the event of a second spike, Johnson's team fear even the current socialdistancing rules would be found wanting. ""It is easy to socially distance when you are outside in a sunny park and people don't mind queuing up in the street outside shops,"" an aide said. ""But if you have to stand outside Tesco in the pissing rain for 40 minutes in the dark in December, that's a very different matter.""In No 10, where Johnson's inner circle obsess over the latest polling, there is evidence the public does not want the twometre rule to be relaxed. But a former cabinet minister said: ""Leadership is about leading public opinion - that's what Boris needs to do.""Sunak made clear in three separate Zoom chats with Tory backbenchers last week that he wanted to get things moving. The chancellor stated that 24 other countries have cut their social distancing limit to under two metres. ""He was signalling not very subtly where he was in this argument,"" one MP said.The chancellor told MPs to encourage their constituents to shop: ""Confidence has taken an enormous knock. We're trying to convey to the nation that its businesses are making shops Covid-secure and safe,"" a message he reinforced in an interview last night. Johnson will pay a visit to a high street this week to make the same point.Nonetheless, Sunak's approach has caused friction with Cummings allies. ""Rishi can keep saying that there is no evidence of a second wave anywhere in the world, but it isn't true,"" one said.In an attempt to persuade the public it is safe, and circumvent Sage's caution, Sir Mark Sedwill, the cabinet secretary, and Alex Chisholm, Johnson's link man with business, have been told to gather evidence to support a cut in the guidelines. Figures supplied to Sedwill by business groups show that a cut to one metre would double the number of office staff who could go in to work from 40% to 80%. Production lines could go from 20% staffed to normal full capacity. Warehouses would go from 70% to 100% too. The key difference is in hospitality, where capacity might increase from 10% to 70%, the difference between extinction and the slim hope of viability for many restaurants. The largest lecture theatre in London, which seats 600, could fit 250 students rather than 50.Johnson's aides are also said to be conminister tacting academics to get a broad range of scientific views. A complicating factor is that the scientists are themselves split between epidemiologists, who want the two-metre rule maintained, and behavioural scientists, who think that ship has sailed. ""The behavioural scientists are saying the rules are breaking down,"" a Whitehall source said. ""Do you want to admit where the public really are, or keep rules that are being ignored? They think it builds confidence to move with the tide a bit.""Johnson remains on the horns of a dilemma created by his own previous decisions. As a government source put it last week: ""We locked down too late and too hard."" Johnson now confronts a triple whammy of an economy on life support, a public content with inactivity and a still too high infection rate which means drastic moves could be disastrous.Senior figures signalled this weekend that Johnson will attempt to say more about the two-metre guidance this week, perhaps offering a post-dated announcement that the distance will be cut if the infection rate keeps coming down.That approach has the backing of Theresa May's former deputy Damian Green, one of the MPs who quizzed Sunak on the MPs' Zoom call last week.He said: ""I'm not saying they should do this tomorrow, but I think it would be a huge help to business in a realistic timescale if the government said from a date in July we will reduce from two metres to one metre, as long as the incidence hasn't gone up. I think that would give people a lot of hope and allow them to plan.""Ministers and aides talk openly of the government needing a ""relaunch"" - another banned word. Johnson's team, instead, describe his plan for a big speech at the start of July, coupled with an economic statement from Sunak, as ""a reset"". Some ministers wonder if Johnson will complete the set with a cabinet reshuffle as well - though a date for that nearer the end of July is more likely.Heads on the chopping block include that of Gavin Williamson, the education secretary, who is accused by some close to Johnson of allowing the return of schools before his plans were ready, and of bowing to pressure from the teaching unions to then abandon the move. One colleague said: ""There comes a moment when you realise he has the looks and mannerisms of Frank Spencer, and once you realise that, you can never unsee it.""Liz Truss, ThérÈse Coffey and Ben Wallace remain unloved by Cummings - though they all survived February's reshuffle - and Robert Buckland, the justice secretary, has shown that doing a good job (in his case controlling Covid-19 in prisons) can change views.MPs, though, say the prime minister needs to think about them as well as his top team. Moderates complain that Downing Street has ""declared war"" on them. Eurosceptics complain about rumours that Nigel Farage is planning to start yet another new party which will erode their support from the right. Many others feel abandoned.A senior backbencher said: ""There is a deafening lack of communication from No 10. For Boris to succeed he's got a hell of a lot of legislation to get through. A majority of 80 is a barrier to Keir Starmer, but it's not a barrier to internal rebellion, which is much more dangerous for Boris. He needs to do some active parliamentary management. There is a lot of tinder that could be set alight by the next failure.""Ministers are openly discussing another cabinet reshuffle",Newspaper
79,Coronavirus in England: half of those with symptoms not isolating;Scientists say failure to follow advice raises questions over test-and-trace policyCoronavirus - latest updatesSee all our coronavirus coverage,"May 29, 2020 Friday",International,The Guardian (London),963,963,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,"Ian Sample, Hannah Devlin, Frances Perraudin, Peter Walker, Sarah Boseley",Coronavirus in England: half of those with symptoms not isolatingScientists say failure to follow advice raises questions over test-and-trace policyCoronavirus - latest updatesSee all our coronavirus coverage,"Only half of people who develop coronavirus symptoms self-isolate for at least a week, according to government science advisers, raising urgent questions about the test-and-trace strategy aimed to contain future outbreaks.The new system, which launched this week, requires people to self-isolate for 14 days if they are told by tracers that they recently came into contact with someone who tested positive for the virus.But an April report presented to the government's Scientific Advisory Group on Emergencies (Sage), said ""rapid"" research was needed on how best to get people to comply with self-isolation advice given that ""only around 50%"" abided by the rule when they developed a cough or fever, according to Department of Health tracking in England.The revelations appear in the latest tranche of documents and the first minutes of meetings published by Sage. The minutes from 34 meetings held from January to May were released with other documents submitted to Sage by its modelling and behavioural science subgroups.The minutes reveal a sense of rising anxiety at Sage as scientists saw the number of cases grow faster than expected, with the experts recommending on 13 March that household isolation and protecting older, more vulnerable people should happen ""soon"".Three days later, the advice changed: the committee heard there could be 10,000 new cases a day, prompting them to recommend further physical distancing ""as soon as possible"" adding that a ""significant increase in testing"" was needed.The group of experts considered further documents on the track-and-trace system, with one report from behavioural scientists warning that they ""anticipate major behavioural barriers"" to people using the NHS contact-tracing app, that would prevent it from being the primary method of containing outbreaks.They go on to warn that foreign powers will seek to capitalise on any weaknesses they spot in the UK's response to the outbreak.Many of the documents include redactions, mostly of names of people on the Sage secretariat and others who participated directly in the meetings.Weeks before the lockdown was announced, on 25 February Sage held a prescient discussion about the importance of perceived fairness in reducing the chance of disorder, saying public compliance was ""likely to be enhanced [by] a sense of collectivism"", and that ""flash points tend to happen where there is a perceived lack of equity"".A further meeting on 18 March said that evidence supported school closures on a national level ""as soon as practicable to prevent NHS intensive care capacity being exceeded"", warning that the UK appeared to be a few weeks behind Italy in the pandemic curve. The advice added: ""If the interventions are required, it would be better to act early."" Boris Johnson announced immediate schools closures in England that day.The chronology of the minutes shows how rapidly events overtook planning. On 3 March, a Sage meeting said there was ""currently no evidence that cancelling large events would be effective"", and that closing restaurants and bars ""would have an effect, but would be very difficult to implement"". But only a week later, the next Sage meeting said the UK could have up to 10,000 cases, spread nationally.Other points raised by the documents include:•The main No 10 representative was Ben Warner, a data scientist recruited to Downing Street after running the Conservatives' election campaign model. He previously worked with Dominic Cummings on the Vote Leave campaign.•Concerns about the vulnerability of care homes, with Sage's modelling subgroup warning that 90% of care homes having outbreaks ""cannot be ruled out if current trends are maintained.""•The view that repurposed drugs are unlikely to deliver a ""game-changing"" breakthrough"" for treating the virus.•A warning that the entire UK population may need flu jabs in the coming winter as the search for a Covid-19 vaccine continues.•The realisation that longer-term health problems are emerging, including ""extreme tiredness and shortness of breath for months"".•A warning that creating ""bubbles"" for people to mix in would have mental wellbeing benefits but carry unforeseen risks and the potential for the virus to spread.•A request for pastoral support for advisers and more effective means of screening requests to Sage members, given that they would continue to work ""under intense pressure"" for many more months.Government scientific advisers expressed caution about the efficacy of the planned track-and-trace system, which was rolled out across England on Thursday, saying that for it to work, around 80% of non-household contacts would have to be traced and isolated within 48 hours of the first person experiencing symptoms.This would need about 30 contacts to be tested per case, the Scientific Pandemic Influenza Group on Modelling, which reports to the health department, said in meetings in April, adding: ""Beyond that, benefits would be marginal.""The documents are the latest to be released after No 10 came under pressure to publish the membership of Sage and the advice it provided to ministers. In April, the Guardian revealed that Cummings, the           prime minister's senior aide, had participated in Sage meetings. His presence at meetings ""shocked"" the government's former chief scientific adviser, Sir David King, who said: ""If you are giving science advice, your advice should be free of any political bias.""The minutes show that Dominic Cummings attended six of the 34 meetings, mainly ones in later April and May, as a government representative. Another No 10 staffer, Ben Warner, attended 14. Warner is a data scientist recruited to Downing after running the Conservatives' election campaign model. He previously worked with Cummings on the Vote Leave campaign.",Newspaper
80,Sage minutes reveal how UK advisers reacted to coronavirus crisis;Government releases papers showing how advice changed in run-up to lockdownCoronavirus - latest updatesSee all our coronavirus coverage,"May 29, 2020 Friday",International,The Guardian (London),2148,2148,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,"Ian Sample, Frances Perraudin, Peter Walker, Sarah Boseley and Hannah Devlin",Sage minutes reveal how UK advisers reacted to coronavirus crisisGovernment releases papers showing how advice changed in run-up to lockdownCoronavirus - latest updatesSee all our coronavirus coverage,"The UK government released more than 50 documents on Friday - including the minutes of 34 meetings of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage). The documents set out how scientists tracked - and reacted to - the pandemic. By mid-March, a sense of panic was setting in.                   22 January - Poor data from China                   In the first Sage meeting responding to the outbreak of coronavirus in Wuhan, the committee agrees there is considerable uncertainty around the data coming out of China, meaning ""a reasonable worst case cannot be made reliably"".                   28 January - Test ready by end of week                   The committee says a test for coronavirus should be ready by the end of the week, with a capacity to run 400 to 500 tests per day. It agrees on the importance of behavioural science informing policy.                    3 February - Sage rejects travel restrictions                   The committee considers imposing restrictions on travel into the UK. It concludes that reducing imported infections by 50% would maybe delay the onset of any epidemic in the UK by about five days. ""Only a month of additional preparation time for the NHS would be meaningful.""                     5 February - Nervtag recommends masks                   Nervtag (New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group) recommends symptomatic people should be encouraged to wear a surgical face mask, ""providing that it can be tolerated"". Sage agrees that shutting down public transport or restricting public gatherings would ""probably be ineffective"" in delaying the spread of the virus.                   6 February - Sage extends self-isolation guidance                   The virus is in the UK and Sage notes that a third person, a man who had recently visited Singapore, had tested positive for coronavirus. It now advises that those who have travelled from Thailand, Japan, Republic of Korea, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Singapore, Malaysia or Macau and are showing symptoms self-isolate.                   11 February - Prediction that mass testing will end                   Sage predicts an eventual end for any attempt at mass testing and contact tracing, saying it is not possible for the UK to accelerate coronavirus testing capacity alongside regular flu testing. It recommendeds that Public Health England establishes a criteria for when ""contact tracing is no longer worthwhile"".                   13 February - Prediction that stockpiling could be an issue                   Sage hears that ""scepticism and general inaction dominate"" among the general public and will continue to do so until the first coronavirus death in the UK. They warn there could be perceived competition for limited resource (e.g. food, medicines).                   18 February - PHE contact tracing limited                   Sage concludes that ""priorities would shift during a potential outbreak from containment and isolation on to delay and, finally, to case management"". It says Public Health England could cope with ""five new cases a week (requiring isolation of 800 contacts)"", with potential capacity to increase to 50 new cases and 8,000 contact isolations.                   20 February - Physical distancing could slow the spread                   Meeting hears the first evidence ""of local transmission unlinked to individuals who have travelled from China, in Japan, Republic of Korea and Iran"". It is also told there is some evidence from China and Hong Kong ""that social distancing measures have had some impact in limiting the outbreak"".                   27 February - Committee hears 500,000 deaths possible                   Meeting discusses the ""reasonable worst case scenario"" in which 80% of the UK population is infected, with a 1% fatality rate - which would mean up to 500,000 deaths, a key move towards eventual lockdown. This was modelling from Prof Neil Ferguson of Imperial College, who was at the meeting.                   3 March - Start of lockdown guidelines being drawn up                   A key conclusion from this meeting is that PHE is ordered to start drafting public guidance on potential lockdown, informed in part by behavioural science advice.                   5 March - First mention of isolating people with Covid                   The meeting concludes that there would be a need, within one to two weeks, to make symptomatic people isolate for 14 days, and then about two weeks later to consider ""cocooning"" older or otherwise medically vulnerable people.                   10 March - Transmission is under way                   This meeting concludes that ""transmission is under way in the community"" and that modelling suggests ""the UK is 10-14 weeks from the epidemic peak if no mitigations are introduced"". It hears that the UK could have up to 10,000 cases already, and is about four to five weeks behind Italy. There is also, it says, a ""priority"" to get more antibody testing.There is also an acknowledgment of the looming crisis to come in care homes. ""Sage advised that special policy consideration be given to care homes and various types of retirement communities.""                   13 March - 'Things are worse than we thought'                   This meeting finds there were more cases in the UK than previously expected at this point, and that household isolation and protecting older and more vulnerable people should happen ""soon"".""Sage now believes there are more cases in the UK than previously thought and we may therefore be further ahead of the epidemic curve ...""                   16 March - Sage advice changes                   This meeting hears of a significantly different situation: now, it says, ""there is clear evidence to support additional social distancing measures be introduced as soon as possible"". The minutes add: ""These additional measures will need to be accompanied by a significant increase in testing and the availability of near real-time data flows to understand their impacts.""It is possible, the committee is told, that the UK could now have up to 10,000 new cases per day. Sage also speaks of the possibility of closing schools. ""While Sage view remains that school closures constitutes one of the less effective single measure to reduce the peak epidemic, it may nevertheless become necessary ... to push demand for critical care below NHS capacity.""                   18 March - Evidence backs schools closures                   This meeting is told that ""available evidence now supports implementing school closures on a national level as soon as practicable to prevent NHS intensive care capacity being exceeded"". The UK now seems to be two to four weeks behind Italy. It considers measures just for London, such as closing restaurants and bars, saying the capital appears to be one or two weeks ahead of the rest of the UK.                   23 March - Lockdown is announced                   The day the lockdown is announced, and Sage sets out some of its key concerns. The reproductive R rate is high - and London could run out of ICU capacity in 10 days. ""The science suggests the [R rate] is now around 2.6-2.8. High rates of compliance for social distancing will be needed to bring the reproduction number below one and to bring the cases within NHS capacity.""On the NHS: ""The NHS is surging bed capacity over the next fortnight with a focus on London. The data suggest that London is 1-2 weeks ahead of the rest of the UK ... case numbers in London could exceed NHS capacity within the next 10 days.""It adds: ""Increased community testing and surveillance will be invaluable to measure the effects of the interventions taken. Sage noted that social distancing behaviours have been adopted by many but there is uncertainty whether they are being observed at the level required to bring the epidemic within NHS capacity.""Sage also notes ""there is a worldwide shortage of reagents, platforms and equipment"".                   26 March - 'No hasty decisions' on treatments                   The meeting agrees that, once R is below 1 and demand on critical care is brought within capacity, a focus is needed on behavioural and social interventions and on the testing regime necessary for exiting lockdown. The scientists advise that no hasty decisions should be made on treatments, such as the malaria drug chloroquine, based on insufficient or conflicting data. The meeting hears that nosocomial transmission - the spread of Covid-19 in hospitals - needs urgent attention. Advisers re-emphasise ""the importance of urgently ramping up testing of appropriate quality"".                   7 April - Face masks have 'minimal effect'                   The meeting hears that the increased use of face masks would probably have minimal effect in terms of preventing the spread of infection. However, questions are raised about whether this conclusion would change if it were known that there were high levels of transmission between asymptomatic individuals.                   9 April - The Peak?                   The meeting is told that the epidemic may be reaching its peak, but could remain at a plateau for some time. The chief veterinary officer advises the meeting that the risk of transmission from cats to humans is low.                   14 April - R-value coming down                   The meeting hears that the R-value of the epidemic is probably between 0.5 and 1 - but that relatively small changes to social distancing measures could push R back above 1.However, the spread of infection within hospitals is making up an increasing proportion of cases and care homes are also flagged as a concern, with Sage noting the lack of data available. The scientists discuss the extensive pros and cons of recommending face masks, but conclude that ""evidence does not currently support [their] use"" in the general population.                   21 April - Obesity is a risk                   The scientists decide there is ""enough evidence to support recommendation of community use of cloth face masks, for short periods in enclosed spaces, where social distancing is not possible."" They add that any policy decision on masks ""must not jeopardise supply"" to health and social care settings. Discussions about who is most vulnerable to the disease flags up that ""there is a clear signal that obesity is a risk factor"".                   23 April - No game-changing existing drugs                   Sage is downbeat on the potential for existing drugs to be repurposed to treat Covid-19: ""Repurposed medicines are unlikely to deliver a 'game-changing' breakthrough for treating the virus.""                   28 April - Stick with 2 metres                   The committee notes that a possible complication has emerged in children. The ""kawasaki-like syndrome"" has ""a probable link to Covid-19 ...""""The 2 metre rule remains appropriate though short-duration closer contacts are likely to present very low risk.""                   1 May - Test and trace                   Sage discusses the test-and-trace system and agrees ""that at least 80% of contacts of an index case would need to be contacted for a system to be effective"".""For the test-and-trace system to be effective, isolation of contacts of individuals with Covid-19 within 48 hours was desirable. ""The aim should be to develop the capability to test index cases in less than 24 hours ... It is considered essential that this testing capability is reached before the autumn/winter flu season when a large number of those reporting symptoms may not have Covid-19.""                   5 May - Focus on care homes                   Sage calls or a focus on reducing transmission in health and care settings. It is ""necessary to reduce transmission in care homes and hospitals in order to effectively manage the epidemic"".Sage says relaxing lockdown measures should not happen until new cases have dropped to a low level - not on a fixed date.                   7 May - Ferguson thanked after he quits                   Sage reiterates there ""should be extensive testing of healthcare workers including asymptomatic workers"". It notes ""the important contribution made by Neil Ferguson over the course of the response and [agrees] the importance of continuing to draw upon the work of the Imperial College London team.""Preliminary results of a study indicate that ""the virus decays rapidly when exposed to artificial sunlight"".It notes some rare symptoms or complications that are emerging, including ""cerebrovascular events, renal disease and systemic endothelial and organ dysfunction. Also notes longer term health problems, including ""extreme tiredness and shortness of breath for months.""The creation of ""bubbles"" are beneficial for mental wellbeing and allowing children to be shared between households, but could ""reconstruct extensive networks"" that could ""enable transmission through the population"".",Newspaper

Tetlock and Dan Gardner - a journalist and New York Times best-selling author.The book, released in 2015, details findings from the Good Judgement Project, which was co-created by Tetlock.The study employed several thousand ordinary people as volunteer world event forecasters, who were pitted against each other in contests to create the most accurate forecast.The results showed the top forecasters in GJP are 'reportedly 30% better than intelligence officers with access to actual classified information.'The book Superforecasting, analyses these results.American business-focused newspaper, The Wall Street Journal, called the book 'the most important book on decision making' since the 2011 book Thinking, Fast and Slow by Daniel Kahneman - a Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences laureate. Cummings believes reading both books will enable people to make better decisions. According to The Times, Cummings dismissed suggestions that the PM wanted a Brexiteer installed as cabinet secretary as 'totally and utterly stupid' and 'a dumb idea'. Cummings claimed he was uninterested in how people voted in 2016 and only wanted those who could deliver results. During the away day, which is expected to take place on a Saturday, each adviser will be expected to deliver a list of issues that were preventing progress on Government policies in their own department and across Whitehall. Number 10 has faced criticism over the decision to replace National Security Adviser Sir Mark Sedwell, with a political appointee, David Frost, who is currently Mr Johnson's chief Brexit negotiator. Former PM Thersea May questioned Cabinet Office Minister Michael Gove in the Commons yesterday. Mr Johnson has been criticised for the appointment as, unlike previous holders of the post, Mr Frost is a political adviser rather than a career civil servant - who also lacks security experience.Sir Mark is also stepping down as Cabinet Secretary and head of the Civil Service, amid reports of clashes with Mr Johnson's chief adviser Dominic Cummings.Speaking during an urgent question in the Commons, Conservative MP Mrs May said: 'I served on the National Security Council for nine years - six years as home secretary and three as prime minister.'During that time, I listened to the expert independent advice from national security advisers.'On Saturday (Mr Gove) said: 'We must be able to promote those with proven expertise.''Why then is the new national security adviser a political appointee with no proven expertise in national security?'Mr Gove responded: 'We have had previous national security advisers, all of them excellent, not all of them necessarily people who were steeped in the security world, some of whom were distinguished diplomats in their own right.'David Frost is a distinguished diplomat in his own right, and it is entirely appropriate that the prime minister of the day should choose an adviser appropriate to the needs of the hour.'                     High Output Management: The book described as a 'Silicon Valley staple'                    High Output Management is a 1983 book by the late Hungarian-born American businessman Andrew S Grove.Grove, who died in 2016, age 79, escaped from Communist-controlled Hungary at the age of 20 and moved to the United States.He went on to become the third CEO of tech firm Intel, which he helped transform into one of the biggest tech companies world wide and himself became influential, through his work and books, and was named Times 'Man of the Year' in 1997. High Output Management was one of his most influential books, covering business operation methods - and shares his perspective on how to build and run a company. It is a described by Google Books as a 'legendary business book and Silicon Valley staple'. The book is described as 'equally appropriate for sales managers, accountants, consultants, and teachers, as well as CEOs and startup founders'.Another book written by Grove was 'Only the Paranoid Survive: How to Exploit the Crisis Points that Challenge Every Company and Career'.",Web Publication
82,Is the future really much brighter?;MIND HEALING,"June 29, 2020 Monday",International,The Daily Telegraph (London),474,474,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,Linda Blair,Is the future really much brighter?MIND HEALING,"As we ease ourselves back into a life approaching normal, there is a certain amount of pressure to enjoy the activities we yearned for while we weren't allowed to do them.But how accurate are we when it comes to knowing how much we'll enjoy a future event? Not very, according to Harvard psychologist Daniel Gilbert. When individuals make predictions about their emotional reactions to future events, he's found they overestimate both the strength and the duration of their feelings.For example, Barbara Mellers and Peter McGraw at Ohio State University found dieters who failed to lose weight didn't feel as bad as they thought they would; and women awaiting results from a pregnancy test overestimated how unhappy they'd be if they received unwanted results. Gilbert also found individuals whose relationships end overestimate how bad they'll feel two months later.There are a number of reasons why we make these mistakes. We focus only on the anticipated event itself; failing to take into account how much other factors will influence our thoughts and feelings at that future time. For example, because you've been socially isolated, when you think about returning to work you may consider only how much you'll enjoy seeing colleagues again, while forgetting you'll also face the hassle of commuting, sorting out family before leaving for the office, and having to work to someone else's schedule.We're also influenced by our current circumstances when estimating how we'll feel in the future. Gilbert found, for example, if participants shopped when they'd just eaten, they underestimated how much they'd want a sweet treat later in the week.Extraneous factors can also influence our estimates. When David Schkade at the University of Texas and Daniel Kahneman at Princeton asked students at Midwest and California universities who they thought would be happier, almost everyone said California students, because they assumed objective factors such as the better weather and greater cultural opportunities were key.Yet when asked to estimate their own level of life satisfaction, students at Midwest universities were just as happy.The research shows we're very bad at knowing how we'll feel in the future. We overestimate the impact change will have on us and how long the impact will last; we find it hard to imagine the whole picture; and we allow current feelings and extraneous factors to colour our estimates of future events.Instead of trying to cling on to a recent past when everything was ""normal"", why not focus on what you can enjoy right now? After all, whatever the future holds, you'll almost certainly find a way of adjusting to it.Linda Blair is a clinical psychologist and author of Siblings: How to Handle Rivalry and Create Lifelong Loving Bonds.

83,Pig-out plan is more of a tasty morsel;business commentary Alistair Osborne,"July 9, 2020 Thursday",International,The Times (London),521,521,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,Alistair Osborne,Pig-out plan is more of a tasty morselbusiness commentary Alistair Osborne,"So much for the PM's war on obesity. He hadn't reckoned with his happy meal chancellor: the one breezily offering a tenner off a blowout down the local curry house. Yes, it's only available Mondays to Wednesdays and just during August. But you can go round ""unlimited"" times. How will Boris resist? Of course, he's not meant to: the point of Rishi Sunak's ""eat out to help out"" wheeze, complete with mouthful slogan. He made it the finale of his ""Plan for Jobs"": the traditional rabbit out the hat, or toad in the hole, moment for any budget, even mini-ones. But even he knows it's a bit of a stunt. On the Treasury's figures, the scheme wolfs down only £500 million of the £30 billion goodies on offer.Yet it was instructive in its way: a measure at one with a jobs package that, however welcome, is a bit of a post-corona test of behavioural economics. The pig-out plan brings red tape, requiring businesses to register. It also relies on people feeling safe enough to go out. And who knows what complexities may yet arrive: can a single diner do a Bogof, for example, and order two pizzas for themselves? Some consumers will feel let down, too, not least those who'd hoped Mr Sunak might try something far bigger, such as the £500 high street voucher per adult championed by the Resolution Foundation.But, as game theory goes, all this is just an appetiser for the bigger stuff. And particularly the new job retention bonus, costed at up to £9.4 billion. Employers have furloughed nine million workers. So, to give them an incentive to hang on to them after the furlough scheme ends in October, Mr Sunak will pay companies a £1,000 bonus for every furloughed staffer they keep on the payroll until the end of January.Even so, as Oxford Economics put it, ""£1,000 is unlikely to be decisive for many employment decisions"". And what's to stop an employer taking the bonus and then sacking staff in February? Indeed, it's hard to spot what sort of behavioural theory Mr Sunak has bought into here against, for example, simply lopping £9.4 billion off employer costs - via cutting their national insurance contributions, say.Elsewhere, the kickstart, trainee and apprentice schemes for young workers are all welcome. Ditto, a short-term VAT cut for hospitality companies from 20 per cent to 5 per cent, even if accountants MHA MacIntyre Hudson reckon pubs will now have to apply three rates: the full whack for booze, zero for cold takeaway food and 5 per cent for everything else.But there was nothing to directly boost business investment. It's hard to see how a temporary cut to stamp duty will create new jobs. Won't it just produce a spike in moves before the March 31 deadline? And how many times has the government tried something similar to the £2 billion ""green homes grant""? Home insulation really isn't that exciting. To boot, there's only so much Mr Sunak can do while the virus is at large. Not to be churlish, either, but he's already spent the big money in this crisis: almost £160 billion of direct fiscal support. By comparison, his £30 billion jobs package isn't the biggest deal, even with a meal deal thrown in.",Newspaper
84,Keeping up with the data;Use of AI in healthcare is falling short of its potential as the continent faces obstacles of infrastructure and ethics. By David Pilling,"May 15, 2020 Friday",International,"Financial Times (London, England)",1500,1500,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,David Pilling,Keeping up with the dataUse of AI in healthcare is falling short of its potential as the continent faces obstacles of infrastructure and ethics. By David Pilling,"Two days after the World Health Organization declared coronavirus a pandemic on March 11, the South African data science competition platform Zindi set a challenge. Budding data scientists were asked to come up with a model to predict the spread of Covid-19 using open-source data. A fortnight later, more than 500 hopefuls had entered, vying for the $5,000 prize. Entries will be judged in June against the spread of the disease measured in global deaths.Celina Lee, who co-founded Zindi in Cape Town 18 months ago, describes the platform as a way of showcasing budding African data scientists and matching them with companies that have data but lack the expertise to exploit it.Winners of the regular competitions - which include topics such as classifying fields by crop type using satellite imagery in South Africa, or forecasting flood patterns in Malawi - are sometimes hired directly by the company or institution sponsoring the challenge. Others simply compete for the prize money or, more importantly, says Lee, the opportunity to improve their skills through tackling real-world problems. More than 12,000 aspiring data scientists have already registered.The need for companies such as Zindi, essentially a matchmaker between problems and problem solvers, highlights a significant obstacle to the practical use of artificial intelligence in Africa. Whatever one thinks about the idea of clever computers patching up infrastructure shortfalls - whether in road networks, administrative capacity or healthcare - the real-world use of AI on the continent is falling well short of its potential.""Africa has a lot of talent, but very few systems that make them useful,"" says Bright Simons, a Ghanaian social innovator and machine learning expert, who says Zindi fills an important gap. ""The most talented people rarely get their hands on interesting problems. People need problems to keep their skills sharp.""In much of the continent, the biggest challenge is what Simons describes as the integration of complex data sets with the algorithms that can interpret them. ""AI can do this and that,"" he says. ""But 90 per cent of these are lab problems. For real-world problems, you need to bring a lot of data together, very few of which are controlled by single entities.""Aubrey Hruby, a US investor in African start-ups, recognises the potential of AI systems to solve some health problems in Africa but wonders whether too much faith is being placed in the concept of leapfrogging.""The next wave is centred around telemedicine, the portability of medical records and diagnostics,"" she says. ""But can those things really solve the fact that there are only so many [hospital] beds per population? A lot of these things are just one part of the health system.""Zindi's Lee believes that, given backing, technologies such as machine learning can help expand the reach and efficacy of healthcare resources. She describes a model, which resulted from another Zindi competition, that successfully predicted depression risk in rural Kenya based on answers to a questionnaire.Questions might be as simple as where someone lives or what their house is made of. A computer can then analyse these answers for patterns that might elude a human interrogator. Once patients are identified, the problem becomes one of accessing effective treatment.Another model developed by a Zindi-registered data scientist had a more immediate impact. It helped a child protection helpline operating in Nairobi, Kenya's capital, to set efficient staffing rotas by predicting when most calls would come in. ""In the African context, resources are limited. Any efficiency you can introduce for delivering health services helps,"" says Lee. ""It can change people's lives and it can save people's lives.""Precious Lunga, a Zimbabwean neuroscientist also convinced that AI can make a difference, founded Baobab Circle, which uses algorithms and behavioural science to help patients monitor chronic conditions. Once signed up to the app, patients enter regular dialogue with Afya Pap, a ""digital health companion"" (or sophisticated chatbot) that dispenses medical advice and encourages healthier behaviour.""Our initial focus has been on the self-management aspect of diabetes and hypertension where we monitor data to help the user manage their condition,"" says Lunga, whose company has 50,000 registered users in Kenya, Uganda, Zambia and Zimbabwe.For hypertension, patients take their own measurements with a blood-pressure monitor, which they can use for a small fee in pharmacies. Patients log the results on the app, which can be read by doctors if users grant access. ""You can see between doctor visits what's been going on,"" says Lunga. ""You can see patterns, whether the patient is doing well or needs an intervention.""Since the outbreak of coronavirus, the app has been adapted. ""With Covid-19 it is becoming a trusted source of information,"" says Lunga. ""There's a lot of fake news being passed around about Covid-19 such as WhatsApp messages that say heat will damage coronavirus. That's wrong and potentially dangerous. We have repurposed the app to deliver health advice on prevention - and localise it, with messages such as 'Avoid the market'.""Long before coronavirus struck, Mahamudu Bawumia, Ghana's vice-president, highlighted the value of digital information, from property addresses to hospital records. Although Ghana's digitalisation drive - centred on national ID cards and government services - is primarily aimed at improving administrative efficiency and eliminating corruption, the government recognises the implications for health delivery.Emmanuel Gyimah-Boadi, former director of Ghana's Center for Democratic Development, welcomes the digital push, saying that governments cannot begin to solve people's problems if they do not know who they are and where and how they live. The national ID system - a controversial concept in parts of the continent - is for him ""the beginning of citizenship"", although implementation has been slow.Darlington Ahiale Akogo, founder of minoHealth AI Labs, a Ghanaian data science start-up, says the country's big hospitals have conducted tens of thousands of medical imaging tests. ""But we don't have any records of that,"" he says. Akogo has developed a system that can detect various pathologies from chest X-rays, including pneumonia and fibrosis. ""The AI system performs as well as the best radiologist,"" he claims, adding that this is invaluable in a country with fewer than 40 radiologists. ""How can we use technology like AI and big data to provide fully democratised healthcare that otherwise wouldn't be available?"" Computer power can also be used for research, he says. He is using AI to try to determine why children from Kintampo, a town in the Bono East region, are less susceptible to malaria than those from Accra. ""We are using AI to identify the key things that give people high immunity,"" he says.The hunger for data that such projects generates is tricky in a continent that has not yet grasped the regulatory implications of accessing personal information.The Wellcome Sanger Institute, a UK genome research centre, was recently accused by whistleblowers of commercialising a gene chip without the consent of African people who donated DNA. Sanger denies the allegations, pointing to two separate investigations that found that ""no wrongdoing took place"".Akogo says the use of data must be carefully evaluated from both a legal and ethical perspective. ""What is the right framework for collecting data and using it to improve diagnosis? It's the same problem Facebook and Google are having now. The worst thing we can do is recreate with healthcare that kind of problem. Imagine Cambridge Analytica, but with healthcare,"" he says, referring to the former UK political consulting firm that collapsed after being accused of misusing personal data.Akogo says regulators will also have to develop rules on what he calls ""explainability"". ""Should a system have to explain why it thinks you have pneumonia?"" he asks. ""From a regulatory point of view, it is perfectly reasonable to expect a system to explain itself, but from a technology point of view that might not even mean anything,"" he says. ""If a patient is diagnosed by an AI system, who is responsible legally?"" Yet another ethical dilemma for Africa to grapple with, says Zindi's Lee, is uneven access to broadband and to computer power, which puts many African data scientists at a disadvantage, particularly if they live outside big cities. ""Even a typical university student in Nairobi would struggle with some of the larger data sets,"" she says, adding that some solutions can take up to 12 hours to run on typical computers.Zindi has recently partnered with Microsoft to allow participants to perform their computations in the cloud. ""You should be able to be anywhere or anyone and be able to throw your hat in the ring,"" she says.'Should a system have to explain why it thinks you have pneumonia?'",Newspaper

86,Cummings' actions have taken the 'we' out of keeping to lockdown rules;A sense of shared responsibility has been crucial during the coronavirus crisis. Let's hope it hasn't been shattered Stephen Reicher is a member of the Sage subcommittee advising on behavioural scienceCoronavirus - latest updatesSee all our coronavirus coverage,"May 26, 2020 Tuesday",International,The Guardian (London),681,681,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,Stephen Reicher,Cummings' actions have taken the 'we' out of keeping to lockdown rulesA sense of shared responsibility has been crucial during the coronavirus crisis. Let's hope it hasn't been shattered Stephen Reicher is a member of the Sage subcommittee advising on behavioural scienceCoronavirus - latest updatesSee all our coronavirus coverage,"During his rose garden press conference, Dominic Cummings was asked if his trip to Durham had undermined government public health messaging. I hope not, he replied. Later, Boris Johnson was asked the same question.            His response was more definitive: no one in No 10 has undermined the messaging.            I hope they are right. For this matters. If people stop listening to what the government asks them to do and if they stop adhering to coronavirus measures then the number of infections will rise and more people will die.But I cannot be as certain or as optimistic as the prime minister and his adviser. All that we know about adherence (knowledge that behavioural scientists have repeatedly stressed to the government during the pandemic) suggests that damage has been done.First, for all the complexities of Cummings' story, the bottom line is very simple. While millions of people up and down the land faced agonising personal circumstances and decided to stick with lockdown, Cummings did not. He went to Durham at the very time his government was insisting            ""stay at home, don't travel           "". He went to a beauty spot at the very time his government was insisting we avoid them. And nothing has happened to him. Instead, his actions have been endorsed. At the very least, that gives the appearance of            ""one rule for them, another for us"" (possibly the best way of corroding trust in authority and adherence to the rules). And Cummings more than anyone else understands the importance of appearance in politics.Second, the one thing that has carried us through the pandemic so far has been an emergent sense of community. This ""we"" feeling            has been critical in getting people to adhere to the restrictions, even when they personally were not at risk. It has been critical to all the            volunteering and neighbourhood support that has helped us through hardship. It is the most valuable asset we have in a crisis. But the most notable thing about Cummings'            rose garden performance was that ""we"" was nowhere to be found. It was all about ""I"".His explanation was entirely about his judgments as an individual, his decisions, his personal concerns. At no point was there any thought to the impact of his actions on others. Still worse, in his defence of Cummings on Sunday, the prime minister seemed to endorse the idea that, when the going gets tough, it is fine to rely on your own judgments - and fine to follow your individual ""instincts"".In effect, Johnson's defence of Cummings turned an issue of communal responsibility into an issue of individual preference. Had everyone done that - had we all put so much energy into thinking about loopholes that served our personal circumstances rather than thinking about the impact of our actions on others - then lockdown would not have worked, the infection would still be raging and the NHS would have been overwhelmed.As we come out of lockdown these issues become, if anything, even more important. It isn't that the infection has gone away. Rather we are now in a position, due to past sacrifices by the many, to use more targeted strategies against coronavirus. But these are dependent on us all maintaining physical distancing, increasing hygiene standards, revealing our contacts if infected and observing quarantine if contacted. All of these measures are personally inconvenient. Often it will be easier to ignore them. They will only work if we continue to act together and for each other.I hope this will happen. I hope people will continue to demonstrate the remarkable solidarity they have shown so far. I hope the collective spirit won't be damaged. But this sorry affair doesn't help, and the more they defend themselves, the more our top politician and his top adviser demonstrate that they don't even appreciate what the problems are.

Yet I did. There was nerd boy (better known as me), happily huffing ironing fumes while pressing his most formal shirt (muted tie-dye), trilling ""I'm going to work!"" at no one in particular (the house was empty apart from the cat), and merrily whistling through the front door.For this WFH scab, the thrill was not the prospect of a near-empty office which is an uncanny experience, like arriving at a party you're only reluctantly invited to a full week early. My condition is worse. What I'd genuinely missed is the commute.Everybody is meant to hate the commute. In 2006, Nobel laureate Daniel Kahneman and Princeton economist Alan Krueger surveyed 900 Texan women, asking them how much they enjoyed a number of common activities. Having sex came in first. Socialising after work came second. Commuting came in a distant last. But the commute - specifically the morning one - is my new kink.Twelve weeks ago I thought there would be no tears shed over the death of the 9-to-5, but slowly the commute became my number one pang, the thing I pined for above all else. Deskbound in my front room, watching my sleepy street wander by, the novelty soon wore off.This morning, as I cycled over Vauxhall Bridge, I was like Basil Fotherington-Tomas on wheels. Hello clouds! Hello sky! Exhaust fumes, how I've missed you!Cyclists are notoriously oddball outliers: a 2005 Canadian survey assessing work journeys found that the paltry three per cent of people who actively enjoyed commuting all cycled to work. And it's true, coaxing London back on to the commute is going to be a struggle; the Tube is, to borrow the Prime Minister's phrase, a ""natural vector"" for the virus to travel on.Driving always looks appealing to those that don't drive, and seems an alluring bubble. There's some trepidation that London could fragment into a city of the haves and the have-parking-spots - followed, in angry traffic trails, by everyone else. But let me try and peddle you this snake oil. The commute - by train, bike frame or plain old walking - is my essential medium for thought and decompression; it is the perfect zero space in the frenetic juggle to hold on to a work-life balance. I've missed people-watching on the Tube (especially watching people tut and flick past a massive, gormless picture of myself in print). In this post-Covid reality, in which work is home, and home is hard work, travelling with purpose is an essential break from both. Nothing else presents the same vacuum of time with no need to do anything. Let us escape reality by returning to it.",Newspaper

""You only need to go on public transport, where they are supposed to be mandatory, to see how many people are ignoring this new rule based on the growing body of evidence that wearing a mask will help protect others - and might even protect you.""The first report is a new review of scientific research on mask wearing from around the world. ""The evidence for the benefit of wearing face coverings in protecting others from infection is becoming clearer all the time,"" said its co-author, Paul Edelstein of the University of Pennsylvania.""In fact, we have now identified convincing decades-old and apparently forgotten evidence, from the time when surgical masks were made of cloth and were reusable, showing that they help to prevent transmission of airborne infectious agents,"" Prof Edelstein said.The second report, issued jointly by the Royal Society and British Academy, looked at the behavioural science of mask wearing. It said that at the end of April just 25 per cent of people in the UK wore masks in public places, compared with 83 per cent in Italy, 66 per cent in the US and 64 per cent in Spain.",Newspaper
89,"UK's two-metre rule is based on little evidence, leading scientists say amid mounting calls on government to drop the measure","June 16, 2020 Tuesday",International,MailOnline,2550,2550,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,Vanessa Chalmers Health Reporter For Mailonline,"UK's two-metre rule is based on little evidence, leading scientists say amid mounting calls on government to drop the measure","•Professors at the University of Oxford said there is little evidence to support it•They reviewed 38 studies and found 'poor data' to support the rule•It comes as ministers come under intense pressure to slash the rule to save jobs•Prime Minister confirmed he had ordered a 'comprehensive' review•The results are not expected for weeks, leaving businesses hangingBritain's two-metre social distancing rule is based on no evidence, leading scientists have claimed amid mounting calls to drop the measure.Two University of Oxford experts argue there is little proof to support the restriction, after reviewing a World Health Organisation paper on the contentious topic.Of 38 studies, only one looked specifically at coronavirus infections in relation to a specific distancing measure of two metres - and it found it had no effect.The pair of scientists claimed the evidence in favour of the two-metre rule is of 'poor quality' and impacting Britain's chance to go about normal daily life.A senior statistician at the University of Dundee also found the data for two-metre guidelines - which informed experts at the WHO - is flawed. It comes as Tory MPs and the hospitality sector have begged Boris Johnson to make an urgent decision on whether to ease the social distancing rule.The Prime Minister confirmed at the weekend that he had ordered a 'comprehensive' review of the measure, in light of dwindling infection rates. Results are not due until at least July 4 - the date when pubs, restaurants and salons are expected to open, giving businesses no time to prepare for changes.Other scientists say ministers are balancing public health with the economy, and the infection rate across the UK is still too high to relax the rule.                     What is the science behind two-metre social distancing rule?                    The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends a one metre distance between two people from separate households.The reason for this, as stated on its website, is that: 'When someone coughs, sneezes, or speaks they spray small liquid droplets from their nose or mouth which may contain virus. If you are too close, you can breathe in the droplets, including the COVID-19 virus if the person has the disease.'But other countries have taken advice from their own health experts and social distancing varies from two metres (in the UK) down to one metre (in France)The two metre rule can be traced back to research in the 1930s that showed droplets of liquid from coughs or sneezes would land within a one-two metre range.Social distancing varies between different countries:TWO METRES: UK, Switzerland, US, Spain, Italy1.5 METRES: Germany, Poland, NetherlandsONE METRE: Austria, Norway, Sweden, FinlandSO, WHAT HAVE THE STUDIES SHOWN?ONE METRENumber 10's chief scientific adviser - Sir Patrick Vallance - has said that the one metre rule is up to 30 times more risky than the two metre rule.He told MPs earlier this month the risk of spending a minute next to a Covid-19 patient for two minutes was 'about the same' as being within a metre of a Covid-19 case for six seconds.The latest evidence, published in The Lancet, found there was roughly a 2.6 per cent chance of catching the virus when one metre from a Covid patient. But doubling the gap cut the risk to only 1.3 per cent.However, other scientists have called the data used in the study into question.Oxford professors Carl Heneghan and Tom Jefferson said the data was 'poor quality', while Dr Mike Lonergan at The University of Dundee said: 'These data give no indication that two metres is better than one metre.'TWO METREOne of the top scientific advisers to the British Government said the two metre social distancing rule is based on 'very fragile' evidence.Professor Robert Dingwall, a member of Nervtag, referred to it as a 'rule of thumb' rather than a scientifically proven measure.Other experts have said the distance may be a non-scientific estimate that just caught on in countries around the world.IS TWO METRES ENOUGH?The UK's coronavirus social distancing limit is four times too short and the gap should be 26 feet, said experts at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in March.They found viral droplets expelled in coughs and sneezes can travel in a moist, warm atmosphere at speeds of between 33 and 100ft per second.This creates a cloud in the atmosphere that can span approximately 23ft to 27ft (seven metres to eight metres) to neighbouring people, the team said.Another study by scientists in Cyprus, published a fortnight ago, added to the evidence when it found the two-metre rule may not be far enough.Researchers found even in winds of two miles per hour (mph) - the speed needed for smoke to drift - saliva can travel 18 feet in just five seconds.And scientists from the universities of California Santa Barbara and Stanford last week said the two metre rule may have to be trebled when winter strikes.They found droplets that carry SARS-CoV-2 - the coronavirus that causes Covid-19 - can travel up to 20feet (six metres) in cold and humid areas.Writing for The Telegraph, Oxford professors Carl Heneghan and Tom Jefferson said: 'Social-distancing has become the norm. 'The two-metre rule, however, is also seriously impacting schools, pubs, restaurants and our ability to go about our daily lives.'Handwashing and encouragement are what we need, not formalised rules. 'This means trying to keep a distance from each other where possible and avoiding spending time indoors in crowded places. Much of the evidence informing policy in this outbreak is poor quality.'The pair, who work at Oxford University's Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine, combed through an influential review of research published in the medical journal The Lancet on June 1.It was conducted to inform World Health Organization (WHO) guidance and reviewed data from 172 existing studies on the spread of Covid-19, SARS and MERS.All 38 studies focused on the effect of social distancing supported one metre - which what the WHO says is substantial enough to avoid infection - or more.The researchers said keeping one metre apart can slash the risk of catching coronavirus by 80 per cent.There was roughly a 1.3 per cent chance of contracting the virus when two metres from an infected patient. But halving this gap raised the risk to only 2.6 per cent.Now, Professor Heneghan and Jefferson have said the studies are unreliable because they use data which suffer recall bias, which is when there is a possibility participants studied can't remember events accurately. In this case, it's not possible to rely on someone's memory for how closely they stood to other people, and therefore what measure of distance is safe to avoid infection.An independent review of 15 studies also showed some inconsistencies in the data, numerical mistakes and unsound methods in 13 of them. The most concerning, the professors said, was only five studies reported specifically on Covid-19 exposure, with only 477 participants and 26 cases of infection. In only one study was a specific distance measure reported - 'came within six feet of the index patient' - and it didn't show an effect on contracting Covid-19. This means the distance didn't make any impact on whether people got the virus or not. A senior statistician and epidemiologist at The University of Dundee has also cast doubts on the research after reviewing the data. Dr Mike Lonergan found avoiding contact with others is very important, and that staying one metre away may offer slightly more protection but the difference is unlikely to be much. He said their conclusion - which essentially said two metres was better than one - was 'based on misunderstandings of the datasets'.'These data give no indication that two metres is better than one metre,' he said.Former Cabinet ministers Iain Duncan Smith and Greg Clark were among the senior figures calling for an overhaul to the social distancing guidelines in the Commons yesterday.They pointed out that other countries were using lower limits - including Germany and the Netherlands following 1.5 metres, and Austria and Sweden following one metre.Chancellor Rishi Sunak hailed the 'positive impact' it would have on business and jobs. Businesses are waiting on tenterhooks for the findings of a 'comprehensive review' of the two-metre rule by Downing Street - confirmed by Mr Johnson at the weekend.If reduced, it means a significant proportion of the hospitality and retail sector could reopen on July 4 - the earliest date for the next phase of lockdown.For example, figures from the British Beer and Pub Association figures show that, with the current two metre rule, only 20 to 30 per cent of premises will be able to open at a sustainable level.However, if the rule was reduced to one metre, 70 per cent would be able to open.The hospitality sector has welcomed the review, warning that it will simply not be viable for them to reopen unless the social distancing rule is cut to no more than one metre. But Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said the Government would not make any decision until July 4 at the earliest, after No10 yesterday said the result may take 'weeks'. Speaking on BBC Breakfast today, Mr Shapps said: 'We need to make sure that what we do next doesn't mean that we end up in a situation where the virus comes back in a very big way again. 'We've just had this big unlock of non-essential shops yesterday, we know the next big date is not before July 4. 'At that time we will be expected to take a judgement call on things like the social distancing rules.'                      MINISTERS WILL DECIDE ON TWO-METRE RULE. BUT COULD IT COST THEM THE CHIEF SCIENTISTS?                   Senior ministers fear the top scientists advising the Government could quit over plans to ease the two-metre rule.Professor Chris Whitty, the popular Chief Medical Officer, and Chief Scientific Adviser Sir Patrick Vallance have made it clear they believe the current guidance on safe distancing should stay.But Boris Johnson will tomorrow pave the way for it to be relaxed amid fears it could spark millions of job losses, with hospitality particularly badly hit.And Chancellor Rishi Sunak said ministers are 'urgently' looking at whether it can be relaxed to boost shops and allow more pubs and restaurants to reopen.He said it would be a decision for ministers rather than scientists as to when the change comes.The Sunday Times claims Downing Street is concerned at the scale of opposition among scientists, who fear it could lead to a second spike in coronavirus infections.'The worry is that Whitty and Vallance could resign,' a source told the newspaper.'It is getting to the stage where they are threatening to minute their opposition to moving from two metres. Those minutes get formally released.'The insistence of the Government's Scientific Advisory Group on Emergencies (Sage) on maintaining the two-metre rule has caused an intense political backlash, with Tory MPs and the Treasury joining forces to express concern about the economic damage it is wreaking.Figures released last week showed the economy suffered a 20 per cent drop in GDP in April, the largest ever monthly collapse.Chancellor Rishi Sunak told the party's backbench 1922 Committee last week that three-quarters of pubs could open if the distance was cut to one metre, and cited the fact that 24 countries had introduced the flexibility to reduce it.Mr Johnson's new review will take advice from a range of experts, including the Chief Medical Officer Chris Whitty and Chief Scientific Adviser Sir Patrick Vallance - but also behavioural scientists and economists. It will operate in addition to a rolling review of the guidance being carried out by Sage.Prof Whitty has public spoken of the importance of the two-metre rule. He has said social distancing - as well as hand washing, 'good cough etiquette', the use of face coverings - will be in place 'for as long as this epidemic continues'.Sir Patrick Vallance, the chief scientific adviser, has said there was 'relatively little room for manoeuvre' in easing the lockdown measures.A source told the Sunday Times that they were worried the scientists would 'minute' their opposition to any change, meaning it would be published in records of Sage meetings.Katie Nicholls, chief executive of trade union UKHospitality, called for the Government to provide urgent clarity for the hospitality sector, a call echoed by Labour's shadow business minister Lucy Powell.Ms Nicholls told BBC Breakfast: 'It employs 2.3million people, so it's a huge industry that doesn't have certainty about an opening date, doesn't know when it can take bookings, doesn't know what guidelines it will be opening under, and potentially could be opening within three weeks.'With all of that uncertainty it makes it a very anxious environment for our teams and our staff members, and we can't reassure them about their jobs.'Shadow business minister Lucy Powell said: 'We urge the government to publish an action plan which maximises economic viability, whilst minimising the risk to the health of customers and staff. 'If they fail to act, our communities will lose much-loved pubs, bars and restaurants, and we'll see a wave of closures and unemployment which will damage villages, towns and cities across the country.' Health minister Ed Argar said yesterday the two metre rule may be relaxed if changes are made to the rules around face coverings - which evidence is beginning to suggest is more protective than any other disease control intervention.He said the possibility of compulsory face coverings in shops and the like was one of a 'menu of options' that was being considered in the review. The two-metre review announcement comes as the WHO urged the Government not to lift the lockdown until it is proven its widely criticised coronavirus contact-tracing system works. There are doubts in government over whether the test and trace system is ready to deal with the potential increase in cases.Mr Johnson said falling numbers of diagnosed coronavirus cases has given the Government 'more margin for manoeuvre' in easing the two-metre rule. But only last week Professor Catherine Noakes, part of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), said it was not safe at this time.She said coronavirustransmission is still too high in Britain to relax the social distancing two-metre rule.There were around 8,000 people still being infected every day two weeks ago, which has dropped to about 5,500 now, according to the Office for National Statistics.Dr Michael Tildesley, infectious disease scientist at the University of Warwick, said reducing the social distancing restriction from two metres to one 'will result in an increase in risk'.He told the BBC: 'The evidence is still slightly unclear - depending upon the studies, it could be anything from about twice the risk to 10 times the risk.'Chancellor Rishi Sunak has said it would be ministers, not scientists, who would make the decisions on any easing.It is feared this could rub top scientists advising the Government the wrong way, considering their focus is on protecting public health.But the PM's spokesman said the review 'will draw on advice from scientific and medical experts as well as economists and papers from Sage'.

90,"Fresh advice on two-metre rule for workers;Being exposed to someone 'for a few seconds' at a one metre distance could equate to an hour of being two metres away, expert says","May 16, 2020 Saturday",International,telegraph.co.uk,723,723,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,"By Edward Malnick, Sunday Political Editor","Fresh advice on two-metre rule for workersBeing exposed to someone 'for a few seconds' at a one metre distance could equate to an hour of being two metres away, expert says","Workers could be given detailed guidance on how long they can remain less than two metres away from colleagues without compromising their safety.A sub-group of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) is examining how workers can ""manage"" the risk of periodically coming within distances such as a metre of others, following concerns about the practicalities of maintaining a two metre gap in settings such as construction sites.Andrew Curran, chief scientific advisor at the Health and Safety Executive, said being exposed to someone ""for a few seconds"" at a one metre distance could equate to around an hour of being two metres away from the same person.A senior official at Public Health England said two metres, although ""very safe"", was ""not a magical number"".The move comes after Sage reviewed whether people need to stay as far as two metres apart amid growing evidence that coronavirus does not transmit well in the air.No10 has insisted that amending the general rule is a ""non-starter"" and government scientists say it is a ""very safe number"". However, Sage scientists are now examining how to give ""better information"" to workers to help them understand the extent to which they can safely come within two metres of colleagues for brief periods, while the overall rule remains in place.The guidance would supplement new rules setting out how eight industries can get back to work, which were unveiled by the Government last week as part of Boris Johnson's phased approach to easing the lockdown.Prof Curran said: ""If the exposure at a distance of less than two metres is going to be for a short period of time, you can manage the risk in the context of duration and orientation.""There is some physics in this and the Sage sub-group on environmental modelling is looking at that to provide better information for people.""For example, if you were exposed for a few seconds at one metre, that is probably about the same as being exposed for a longer period of time-an hour, say-at two metres. It is that order of magnitude.""Speaking to MPs on the Commons Work and Pensions Committee, Prof Curran added: ""It is important that people understand the work activities that comprise a whole job. There may be elements within a job where there is exposure for a short period of time, but where the risk is so low it can be managed effectively by using common sense and a better understanding of how that transmission might progress.""John Simpson, a medical director at Public Health England, said: ""There is a duration and a distance element to the exposure that has to be worked through, as two metres is not a magical number.""But, also addressing the Commons committee last week, Prof Simpson added: ""We know two metres is a very safe number. Some other countries, for instance Germany, say 1.5 to two metres, although privately they are beginning to move more towards two metres. Two metres is a good distance.""The other thing, from a behavioural science point of view, is that two metres is actually a very good distance for everyone to think about, because it is basically the distance of somebody lying down between you and the next person. It has quite a good behavioural science backing to it, apart from being safe from a scientific point of view.""The government guidance on workplaces, issued last week, emphasised that social distancing is paramount in the fight against Covid-19, with working from home encouraged as much as possible.Firms whose staff cannot work from home were told that workers should be kept two metres apart. Recommendations included erecting screens and barriers to separate staff, who should sit side-by-side or back-to-back but not face-to-face. The guidelines also suggest using floor markings to help people stay two metres apart. Earlier this month, Prof Robert Dingwall, who sits on the Government's scientific advisory body New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group, which feeds into Sage, claimed that it ""made sense"" to reduce the distancing rule to 1.5 metres, bringing it into line with nations such as Germany and Australia.""Standing in line two metres apart outside supermarkets does not make a lot of sense,"" Prof Dingwall told The Telegraph. ""The two-metre rule does not have validity and has never had much of an evidence base. I've tried to trace it myself.""",Newspaper; Web Publication
91,These people have no idea what they're doing: Ex-Supreme Court judge LORD JONATHAN SUMPTION gives a devastating verdict on our political leaders' handling of the crisis,"June 21, 2020 Sunday",International,MailOnline,1384,1384,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,Lord Jonathan Sumption For The Mail On Sunday,These people have no idea what they're doing: Ex-Supreme Court judge LORD JONATHAN SUMPTION gives a devastating verdict on our political leaders' handling of the crisis,"Does the Government have a policy for coronavirus? Indeed it does. In fact, it has several. One for each month of the year, all mutually inconsistent and none of them properly thought through. Sometimes, governments have to change tack. It shows that they are attending closely to a changing situation. But this crisis has exposed something different and more disturbing: a dysfunctional Government with a deep-seated incoherence at the heart of its decision-making processes.The root of the problem is the uncomfortable relationship between the Government and its scientific advisers. The Government has repeatedly claimed to be 'guided by the science'. This has in practice been a shameless attempt to evade responsibility by passing the buck to scientists for what are ultimately political, and not scientific, decisions. Scientists can advise what measures are likely to reduce infections and deaths. Only politicians can decide whether those measures make sense in economic and social terms too.Sage, the committee of scientists advising the Government, has been very clear about this, as the minutes of its meetings show. They are not willing to become the Government's human shield, or the fall-guys for its policy misjudgments.Ministers press them for the kind of unequivocal answers that will protect them from criticism. Scientists cover themselves by giving equivocal answers, which reflect the uncertainty of the science. The Government responds by avoiding any decision for which it would have to take political responsibility, until the pressure of events becomes irresistible, when it lurches off in a new direction.Plan A was published on March 3. It concentrated on ensuring the provision of medical and other essential services. It relied on advice and guidance to the public, not coercion. The Government stood out against the authoritarian and indiscriminate measures which were being applied in Italy, and later in other European countries.Plan B was an abrupt U-turn. On March 18, the Government announced the closure of schools. On March 20, pubs, cafes and restaurants were added. Finally, it announced the full lockdown on the evening of March 23.That was a last-minute decision made that afternoon, for which the Government had made no preparations at all. It had not included a lockdown power in the Coronavirus Bill which was then going through Parliament.Instead, it was forced to make legally questionable use of public health legislation designed to control the movements of infected people, not healthy ones. Even then, it took another three days to prepare the regulations, and meanwhile pretended that they were in force when they were not. Judging by its minutes, Sage was unenthusiastic about closing down the hospitality industry, forbidding large gatherings or closing schools. From an early stage, it had pointed out that the real threat was to people over 70 and those with serious underlying medical conditions. Since March 5 they had been advising the Government to 'cocoon' those people, and others who either had the disease or lived in the same household.Sage appears to have envisaged guidance rather than compulsion. 'Citizens', the behavioural scientists advised, 'should be treated as rational actors, capable of taking decisions for themselves and managing personal risk.' If this advice had been followed, it would have left almost all the economically active members of the population free to earn their livings and sustain the economy.Indiscriminate lockdown was a panic response to the now-notorious statistical model produced on March 16 by Professor Neil Ferguson's team at Imperial College. Panic responses leave little room for reflection. No serious consideration appears to have been given to the potentially catastrophic side effects. In fact, the Imperial team did identify the main problem about a lockdown. In an earlier report to Sage, they had pointed out that once a disease had taken hold in a population, 'measures which are too effective merely push all transmission to the period after they are lifted, giving a delay but no substantial reduction in either peak incidence or overall attack rate'.They repeated this view when they recommended a lockdown on March 16 and said that to be effective, it would need to be maintained until a vaccine was available, 'potentially 18 months or more'. They pointed out that this would involve 'enormous' social and economic costs which might themselves have a significant impact on health and wellbeing.The Government justified its Plan B as a temporary measure designed only to delay the peak until the NHS's intensive care capacity had caught up.But when it came to Plan C, which was unveiled on May 10, they forgot all about that. By then the NHS had caught up, mainly as a result of the Government's one undoubted achievement, namely the rapid increase in the country's critical care capacity. The Government dropped 'Protect the NHS' from its slogan. The NHS was saved.But instead of lifting the lockdown, it merely nibbled at its edges, announcing that its essential features would remain in place for weeks or months. No rational explanation was ever offered. But the logic of its position was that the lockdown would have to continue indefinitely.'Christ!' the Prime Minister is reported to have said when Chancellor Rishi Sunak and Business Secretary Alok Sharma explained the economic consequences to him three weeks later on June 2. We were heading for an economic catastrophe: gross domestic product down by more than a fifth and falling; 3.5 million jobs set to be lost in the hospitality industry alone; unemployment already up to two million; several million businesses snuffed out; job openings for a generation of young people extinguished. Why was the PM so surprised? What did he expect to happen if he closed down the economy for several months and conducted a scorched-earth campaign against the rest of our national life? The only plausible explanation was that he had never properly thought about it.So we moved to Plan D, announced on June 10, which involved a general return to work. But in many areas the return was stymied by the Government's two-metre physical distancing rule. The rule never had any rational basis. Very few other countries have it. The World Health Organisation recommends one metre.Experiments by the Department of Health (reviewed by Sage) indicate that the risk of airborne transmission is low outside a healthcare setting. It is being maintained because the Government wants scientific cover and Sage cannot rule out some risk that prolonged face-to-face contact at less than two metres might cause some infection. No one in government was grown-up enough to confront the real issue: does a low risk justify a huge economic cost?Finally, there is the ultimate absurdity of the quarantine recently imposed on incoming travellers, which the Government has admitted was not based on any scientific advice, but simply (it seems) on the mistaken belief that the public would applaud it.The Government is now trying to backtrack by negotiating 'air bridges' with other countries. But it does not need to negotiate anything. This is a problem of our creation. We can simply lift the restriction at our end. Like so many of the Government's measures, it is being maintained simply in order to avoid admitting that it was a mistake.I have had no political allegiance for many years. I have observed the coming and going of governments of one party or another with equal indifference. But it is hard to be indifferent to what is happening now. You have to go back to the early 1930s to find a British Cabinet as devoid of talent as this one.The Prime Minister, who in practice makes most of the decisions, has low political cunning but no governmental skills whatever. He is incapable of studying a complex problem in depth. He thinks as he speaks - in slogans.These people have no idea what they are doing, because they are unable to think about more than one thing at a time or to look further ahead than the end of their noses. Yet they wield awesome power. They are destroying our economy, our cultural life and our children's education in a fit of absent-mindedness.Jonathan Sumption is a former Supreme Court judge and last year's BBC Reith Lecturer.",Web Publication
92,"Former WHO director Anthony Costello: 'Opening pubs before schools says something about our priorities';The paediatrician and member of Independent Sage on Matt Hancock, the likelihood of a vaccine and why 50,000 deaths were preventable","July 5, 2020 Sunday",International,The Observer (London),1562,1562,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,Andrew Anthony,"Former WHO director Anthony Costello: 'Opening pubs before schools says something about our priorities'The paediatrician and member of Independent Sage on Matt Hancock, the likelihood of a vaccine and why 50,000 deaths were preventable","Anthony Costello is a paediatrician and international expert on child health who has been an outspoken critic of the British government's response to Covid-19. He is a member of Independent Sage, a group of experts set up to provide ""robust, independent advice"" in regard to the UK's coronavirus policies, and former director of the Institute for Global Health at University College London. He has worked in a number of low-income nations, developing effective strategies for cutting newborn and maternal mortality rates. He also served as director of maternal, child and adolescent health at the World Health Organization (WHO) in Geneva.                     What do you think about the decision to open pubs yesterday?Well it's very odd in Britain that we're opening pubs before schools. It says something about our priorities. Being outdoors the risks are pretty low - 19 times lower risk according to a Japanese study. I would have said open pubs as long as you serve outside. The worry is that people will be crowding together to get drinks, and that as they'll be drinking, they'll lose their inhibitions. And in an indoor space there's lots of potential to be a super-spreader. So I'm a bit opposed to pubs opening, but I understand the reasons why they've done it.                     Do you agree with                     Sir David King, chair of Independent S                     age                     , that the government has lost all moral authority?Did the government ever have much moral authority? The whole English response, almost from the beginning, has been an unfolding tale of individualism and new Conservatism, which has damaged public health. Now you have this bizarre situation where you've suddenly got this mysterious body called the joint biosecurity centre, which is going to be in charge of data and nobody knows who they are or where they're getting it from. You've got Public Health England (PHE) being marginalised and, I would think, abolished, and the Sage (Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies), which is now wary of the politicians, not really being listened to. So it's a very odd situation.                     PHE was blamed for restricting the coronavirus testing process to its own labs. Was that a fair criticism?Yes, I think it is. If they've got any defence it's that the whole public health system was turned on its head about seven years ago with the Lansley reforms. We had a structure in place that allowed regional public health people to take control of something like an epidemic, and that was dismantled. They've degraded the public health system. You could also argue the problem was Sage. In early February, they should have known that this was a pandemic that was coming and the first thing you would want to do was test - and they had a test. Why didn't they go to the 44 molecular biology laboratories around the country that were all geared up to do this? There was no public health person on Sage. No one who was independent who could say: ""Come on guys, this is what you've got to do.""                     Should the Black Lives Matter protests have been allowed to go ahead?Given that protests are outdoors, and if they're well managed and the people organising the protests make a serious attempt to control them, you could argue that democracy overrides the risk at the moment because we're on the downward part of the curve. The problem is if protests get very big, there is a risk there. But pubs are much more risky than a protest or even Bournemouth beach, which got slightly unfairly criticised.                     What do you say to the criticism that Independent Sage muddies the message and undermines S                     age's authority?David King always says Indie Sage has got to be relevant to the pandemic and constructive in suggesting areas that can be improved on. Obviously, there are people with axes to grind, me included, about aspects of what the government or Sage have done. The problem with Sage is that it is unbalanced. They've got some very good modellers and some good behavioural scientists, but a lot of them have now come over to us because they were very frustrated that they weren't being listened to. Science should be open and discursive.                     It's widely thought the lockdown should have started earlier. Why do you think it didn't and what difference would it have made in terms of deaths?The first reason it didn't happen is because they decided early on that testing wasn't going to be done. That was bizarre. That led on to them really planning a response to the wrong virus - flu. Flu is a very different virus. You don't test for it because it spreads so quickly. The influenza mindset then led them on to this herd immunity idea - that it's a pandemic and you can't stop it. They had 230 contact tracers for 67 million people. In Wuhan, they brought in 9,000 for around 10 million people and they had a full lockdown... I fell off my chair when I watched that 12 March announcement from Johnson. Almost everything they said was wrong. Can you name a virus where you let it run through the population to get herd immunity? Herd immunity is what you get from a vaccine. At the moment we're at about 65,000 excess deaths, according the Financial Times. I honestly think we could have prevented about 50,000 of them, if we'd gone early like South Korea. I think Sage got it wrong, PHE got it wrong, and Boris Johnson got it wrong.                     What is your assessment of a vaccine development and when, realistically, is the earliest one will arrive?The good news is that you've got more labs in the world looking for a vaccine for this virus than any other. They've got better techniques for designing vaccines and there's a lot of money going into it. Having said that, they've never had a vaccine to a coronavirus. Vaccines usually take several years to develop because you've got to test the safety of it. And most worrying, it seems the immune response to the virus is not very good, and fades. That suggests any vaccine you come up with may have only short lasting immunity. For all those reasons I'm cautious. The people I respect say two years would be a possible time. My guess is that we may get a partially effective one a bit quicker.                     Is it possible that, as                                            Sunetra Gupta                      of Oxford University suggests, many people have come into contact with the virus but not developed antibodies?Yes, it is possible. When I first looked at Sunetra's stuff and I spoke to epidemiologists I respect, they said she can't possibly be right. She overestimated the spread of the disease and underestimated its strength. Having said that, there's some element of truth in what she thinks.                     What do you think of Matt Hancock's performance as health secretary?I tweeted recently that he should resign. At first I thought he was probably the most authoritative of the ministers in the briefings. Then he became obsessed by testing without understanding why you do it, from the finding, testing, isolation and support - you need all of that for it to work. But latterly, I think the decisions to go with private companies such as Serco and Deloitte, and with this total mess in Leicester where they can't get the data because the private sector doesn't share it - I think that's almost criminally negligent. And the decision to bypass PHE rather than strengthen it, and strengthen links with primary care, has been lamentable.                     How do you see the virus playing out from here?I invited a modeller on to Indie Sage who is one of the top neuroscientists in the world, a UCL professor called Karl Friston. He does modelling of brain waves. A total genius. He has come up with a totally different approach to modelling to Neil Ferguson and Adam Kucharski, who are very good epidemiologists. He thinks the herd immunity level to stop this epidemic is probably a lot lower than 60%. He thinks it's around 25-30%. What he says is that around half your population is either sequestered or shielded, so are not exposed. Up to a half of the rest are not susceptible, like kids, because they've got good mucosal immunity. And others may get symptoms but not transmit it very easily. We've just sent a letter off to the Lancet about this. If our assumptions are right it may mean that this crisis ends earlier than we expect. But coronavirus won't be eradicated without a vaccine.                     There has been much speculation about societal change following Covid-19. Do you think that will happen and how would you like it to manifest?I hope so. Although I'm a paediatrician and most of my work is doing community health in low-income countries, in the past 10 years I've been quite involved in climate change. I'm co-chair of the Lancet countdown on climate change and health. I used to do too much flying and I always felt when I was at the WHO that you didn't need to do so much of it. I know Zoom can drive you round the bend but we've done everything at Indie Sage on Zoom. And it's been incredibly productive. My fear is that within a couple of years, if this all settles down or we get a vaccine, things will go back to where they were. But the climate crisis is so much more serious and we have so little time to get this right.",Newspaper
93,"If ministers want people to obey the rules, here is what they need to do","May 12, 2020 Tuesday",International,telegraph.co.uk,666,666,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,"By Sheheryar Banuri, behavioural economist","If ministers want people to obey the rules, here is what they need to do","On Sunday May 10th, Boris Johnson set out his plan to return the UK to work. Or rather, he didn't. Instead, we received a description of a new alert system, built largely upon the terror alert system implemented in the UK in 2005, and largely ignored by the public for most of its life. This system has 5 levels. We have been told that we are at level 4, but that we shall move towards level 3 at some point in the future. But not soon. But not in a very long time.On the 11th, Boris Johnson attempted to clarify this, by issuing a 50-page report containing detailed guidelines, but which have led to further confusion.At this stage of the pandemic, it is essential that the public complies with the new guidelines for fighting the coronavirus. Did Johnson do a good job? From my perspective, as a researcher in human behaviour, he did not. Why? In pandemics past, human behaviour has made a big difference to the outcome. For us, now, we do not yet have the means to fight the virus on its own turf. We don't have a vaccine, or any over-the-counter medication to help us. The only thing we can really do is adopt preventative health behaviours. For you and me, that means lockdown - complete with severe restrictions on our way of life. But sticking to the lockdown guidelines is hard: it is easier to not comply than it is to comply. The scientist Neil Ferguson surelyknows this. As does            Robert Jenrick MP. As does            Tahrir Ali MP. As do countless others. Why don't we obey the rules?The answer concerns a phenomenon known as Optimism bias. Optimism bias effects our beliefs about the risk that we face from breaking the guidelines. There are all kinds of reasons that your perception of risk could be lower. Maybe you think you have already had the virus asymptomatically and are now immune. If you are under 30, if you are a healthy weight, if you are a woman, you may have seen information that suggests you are at less risk than others. Maybe, as with imagining your house burning down, you simply believe that the virus is something that happens to other people. It is plain to see that if we believe our susceptibility to illness is lower, we are less likely to stick to the guidelines. To ensure compliance, we need to have two things. First, we need to believe that there is the risk. And for us to feel that risk, we need to trust those who are telling us about it. We need to trust that whatever the authorities are telling us to do will keep us safe. So, with this in mind, what can the government do to ensure that people will stick to the rules?There are a few well-documented ways. Boris Johnson pointed to one in his speech - increasing fines. But this requires policing. It is also unpleasant and draconian. We call this ""enforced compliance"". and we would surely would prefer that people comply voluntarily. The way to increase voluntary compliance is to increase trust in the authorities. How do the authorities appear more trustworthy? They urgently need to make their message clearer and more consistent. A study in Canada conducted during the 2003 SARS outbreak interviewed people about their compliance behavior. One major factor affecting their behavior was inconsistent information from authorities. Inconsistent messaging affects the credibility of the information. It inhibits trust. A consistent message is far more likely to engender trust, and therefore get people to abide by the rules. With this in mind, changing the ""Stay at Home"" message was a misstep, and a misstep made even worse by the devolved Governments of the United Kingdom giving alternative messages. If it wants people to stick to the rules, the Government needs to communicate the rules clearly and consistently. This is the exact opposite of what we got on Sunday, and continue to get. This needs to change, and it needs to change fast.

It spikes again mid-week•Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said signs of low infection could lead to a relaxation of social distancing                     Britain's coronavirus death toll jumped by just 36 today - the lowest since before full lockdown in promising signs the outbreak is improving. Department of Health bosses announced a further 36 fatalities in people with a positive Covid-19 test result across all settings, taking the Government total to 41,698.Today's figure is an astonishing 53 per cent drop on last Sunday's 77. It suggests next Sunday could be the first day to see zero fatalities since March 4.The daily death count is always lower on a weekend due to a lag in reporting. It spikes again mid-week and is only a representation of deaths in people who have had a positive test result for Covid-19.Separate data collected by national statistical bodies shows the Covid-19 death toll is more likely to be 51,000 after taking those who died with suspected Covid-19 into consideration. Tomorrow retail shops in England will be able to open for the first time in 13 weeks - and Boris Johnson has said people should be able to 'shop with confidence'.The Prime Minister said the falling numbers of coronavirus cases has given the Government 'more margin for manoeuvre' in easing the two-metre social-distancing rule, which is being reviewed. [related]In other coronavirus developments today:HOW MANY PEOPLE HAVE REALLY DIED?  Department of Health: 41,662 Department of Health bosses yesterday revealed the death toll had jumped to 41,662 across all settings, including care homes. The daily data does not represent how many Covid-19 patients died within the last 24 hours - it is only how many fatalities have been reported and registered with the authorities. It also only takes into account patients who tested positive for the virus, as opposed to deaths suspected to be down to the coronavirus. Today's official daily count has not been revealed. A preliminary count is calculated by adding up all of the updates provided by each of the home nations suggests it is around 31, taking the total to 41,693.Individual health bodies: 32,387The Department of Health has a different time cut-off for reporting deaths, meaning daily updates from Scotland as well as Northern Ireland are always out of sync. Wales is not affected, however.NHS England today revealed it has registered 27,954 hospital deaths across the country. But the figure only applies to hospitals - meaning fatalities in care homes are excluded from this count.Scotland has recorded 2,448 coronavirus deaths among patients who have tested positive for the virus, followed by 1,444 in Wales and 541 in Northern Ireland. These tolls include fatalities in all settings. National statistical bodies: 51,175Data compiled by the statistical bodies of each of the home nations show 51,175 people died of either confirmed or suspected Covid-19 across the UK by the end of May.The real number of victims will be even higher because the tally only takes into account deaths that occurred up until June 7 in Scotland and May 29 in the rest of Britain, meaning it is up to 10 days out of date.The Office for National Statistics yesterday confirmed that 46,421 people in England and Wales died with confirmed or suspected Covid-19 by May 29.The number of coronavirus deaths was 754 by the same day in Northern Ireland, according to the Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency (NISRA).National Records Scotland - which collects statistics north of the border - said 4,000 people had died across the country by June 7.Their tallies are always 10 days behind the Department of Health (DH) because they wait until as many fatalities as possible for each date have been counted, to avoid having to revise their statistics.Excess deaths: 63,708The total number of excess deaths has almost reached 64,000. Excess deaths are considered to be an accurate measure of the number of people killed by the pandemic because they include a broader spectrum of victims.As well as including people who may have died with Covid-19 without ever being tested, the data also shows how many more people died because their medical treatment was postponed, for example, or who didn't or couldn't get to hospital when they were seriously ill.Data from England and Wales shows there has been an extra 57,961 deaths since the outbreak took hold, as well as 4,808 in Scotland and 939 in Northern Ireland.•Britons today took the opportunity to travel to some of Britain's beauty spots to enjoy the warmer weather as the mercury rose to 73F (23C) in the capital;•Labour's shadow justice secretary David Lammy accused the Government of 'burying' recommendations that came from a report looking at the disproportionate toll Covid-19 has had on people from BAME backgrounds;•Chancellor Rishi Sunak has said ministers will make the final decision on whether to relax the two-metre social distancing rule;•The editor of The Lancet blasted the government for allowing thousands of coronavirus deaths as a result of 'appalling misjudgements'.                     NHS England today recorded 27 deaths in hospitals over 17 trusts compared to 828 deaths over 164 trusts on April 8 - when the most hospital deaths were recorded in a single day.Wales registered three victims in all settings, followed by one in Scotland. Northern Ireland reported zero after two weeks of continuously low figures. Although today's coronavirus death toll is marked improvement in the course of the pandemic, The Lancet's editor has blasted the Government for allowing thousands of needless coronavirus deaths.Dr Richard Horton, who has been editor-in-chief of the prestigious Lancet for 25 years, said people have died as a result of 'appalling misjudgements'.He said the Government was 'glaringly unprepared' for a pandemic - which has so far seen at least 51,000 Covid-19 fatalities in the UK, according to national statistic bodies - and ignored warnings from the World Health Organization. His book, The Covid-19 Catastrophe: What's Gone Wrong and How to Stop It Happening Again, describes the management of the crisis as the greatest science policy failure of a generation. According to The Observer, Dr Horton describes the UK's response to the emergence of the Covid-19 virus as 'slow, complacent and flat-footed', a reaction that show the government was 'glaringly unprepared' for the pandemic.He attacked Public Health England (PHE) for not taking proper note of the World Health Organization's public health emergency warning about the disease. And he ridicules the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) for becoming 'the public relations wing of a government that had failed its people'.Dr Horton is suggesting Sage is not independent, after the Government faced weeks of criticism over a perceived lack of transparency around members of Sage and what was discussed at their meetings. His comments come after several other experts - including Professor Neil Ferguson, whose scientific work triggered the lockdown, and Sir David King, who was the government's chief scientist from 2000-2007 - said Briton's death toll could have been as low as 10,000 if lockdown had been triggered just one week earlier. Today's figure of 31 is a drop in ocean compared to the thousands of people who were dying per day at the height of the pandemic in April, three weeks after infections soar in the middle of March.Labour's shadow justice secretary David Lammy accused the Government of having 'buried' recommendations for people of black, Asian or minority ethnic background (BAME), who have been disproportionately affected by the pandemic. A report by Public Health England looking at why people from BAME backgrounds are more likely to die from Covid-19 than white people came out in May.A leaked draft - due to be published next week - cited racism as a possible factor in why people of such backgrounds are at increased risk of both catching the virus and dying from it. Speaking to the BBC's Andrew Marr Show, Mr Lammy said: 'It's horrifying that at the moment across this country it's hard to be black or Asian and not know someone, or someone who knows someone, who has died. 'I've lost an uncle. I've lost a classmate who died at 45 due to this terrible virus. 'The point is it's a scandal if one week Boris Johnson and Matt Hancock say ""Black Lives Matter"" and then we find out today that they buried part of the review that had the recommendations in it to do something about it.' He added: 'Get on it with it because people are dying every day and you said ""Black Lives Matter"". It's no wonder why people are upset.' It comes amid ongoing Black Lives Matter protests across the UK, which yesterday saw clashes with far-right activists.Meanwhile other Britons hit beauty spots and high streets as temperatures soared to 70F on the second day families were allowed to meet again.These people are taking advantage of Boris Johnson's new 'support bubbles' rules, which allows people from two households to interact with each other at less than two metres apart.With 'support bubbles' in force, people are itching to socialise after being confined to their homes since the 'stay at home' order was given on March 23 - 13 weeks ago.TomTom data showed roads around Liverpool were 75 per cent of pre-lockdown levels at 1pm today.In London, traffic surged to 50 per cent of figures recorded a year earlier - as congestion in Brighton rose to 70 per cent of data recorded at the same time in 2019.Non-essential shops will be able to reopen for business tomorrow after weeks of closure amid the coronavirus pandemic.Rishi Sunak today revealed ministers are 'urgently' looking at whether the two metre social distancing rules can be relaxed to boost shops and allow more pubs and restaurants to reopen.During a round of broadcast interviews, Mr Sunak acknowledged it would have a significant impact on whether the hospitality sector can reopen, which the Government has slated for early July. In a clear sign he would like the rule eased, the Chancellor admitted he could see the 'positive impact' of reducing it to 1.5metres or one metre, citing other nations which have already made such a change. Mr Sunak confirmed that Boris Johnson has ordered a 'comprehensive review' of the rule in England as the Government continues its lifting of the coronavirus lockdown restrictions. The Prime Minister has said today the falling numbers of coronavirus cases has given the Government 'more margin for manoeuvre' in easing the two-metre social-distancing rule due to falling numbers of infections. Speaking during a visit to the Westfield shopping centre in east London to highlight the re-openings of shops, he said: 'As we get the numbers down, so it becomes one in a thousand, one in 1600, maybe fewer, your chances of being, two metres, one metre or even a foot away from somebody who has the virus are obviously going down statistically, so you start to build some more margin for manoeuvre and we'll be looking at that.'A 'comprehensive review' would look at the issue 'in the round', drawing on advice from economists as well as scientific and medical experts, Mr Sunak told Sky News's Sophy Ridge on Sunday programme. Professor Chris Whitty, the popular Chief Medical Officer, and Chief Scientific Adviser Sir Patrick Vallance have made it clear they believe the current guidance on safe distancing should stay.                      MINISTERS WILL DECIDE ON WHETHER TO REDUCE THE TWO-METRE RULE - BUT COULD IT COST THEM THE CHIEF SCIENTISTS?                   Senior ministers fear the top scientists advising the Government could quit over plans to ease the two-metre rule.Professor Chris Whitty, the popular Chief Medical Officer, and Chief Scientific Adviser Sir Patrick Vallance have made it clear they believe the current guidance on safe distancing should stay.But Boris Johnson will tomorrow pave the way for it to be relaxed amid fears it could spark millions of job losses, with hospitality particularly badly hit.And Chancellor Rishi Sunak said ministers are 'urgently' looking at whether it can be relaxed to boost shops and allow more pubs and restaurants to reopen.He said it would be a decision for ministers rather than scientists as to when the change comes.The Sunday Times claims Downing Street is concerned at the scale of opposition among scientists, who far it could lead to a second spike in coronavirus infections.'The worry is that Whitty and Vallance could resign,' a source told the newspaper.'It is getting to the stage where they are threatening to minute their opposition to moving from two metres. Those minutes get formally released.'The insistence of the Government's Scientific Advisory Group on Emergencies (Sage) on maintaining the two-metre rule has caused an intense political backlash, with Tory MPs and the Treasury joining forces to express concern about the economic damage it is wreaking.Figures released last week showed the economy suffered a 20 per cent drop in GDP in April, the largest ever monthly collapse.Chancellor Rishi Sunak told the party's backbench 1922 Committee last week that three-quarters of pubs could open if the distance was cut to one metre, and cited the fact that 24 countries had introduced the flexibility to reduce it.Mr Johnson's new review will take advice from a range of experts, including the Chief Medical Officer Chris Whitty and Chief Scientific Adviser Sir Patrick Vallance - but also behavioural scientists and economists. It will operate in addition to a rolling review of the guidance being carried out by Sage.Prof Whitty has public spoken of the importance of the two-metre rule. He has said social distancing - as well as hand washing, 'good cough etiquette', the use of face coverings - will be in place 'for as long as this epidemic continues'.Sir Patrick Vallance, the chief scientific adviser, has said there was 'relatively little room for manoeuvre' in easing the lockdown measures.A source told the Sunday Times that they were worried the scientists would 'minute' their opposition to any change, meaning it would be published in records of Sage meetings.But ministers - rather than the Government's scientific advisers - will take the final decision on whether to ease the two-metre social distancing rule, Mr Sunak has said. 'Chris Whitty and Patrick Vallance (the Government's chief scientific adviser) throughout all of this have provided advice to ministers,' he told BBC1's The Andrew Marr Show. 'Ultimately it is for ministers. We are the people who are elected to make decisions in this country. People should hold us responsible and accountable for making those decisions. 'I think that people are comforted and have confidence in those decisions if they know that we are taking advice from our scientists.' The Sunday Times claims Downing Street is concerned at the scale of opposition among scientists, who far it could lead to a second spike in coronavirus infections.'The worry is that Whitty and Vallance could resign,' a source told the newspaper.'It is getting to the stage where they are threatening to minute their opposition to moving from two metres. Those minutes get formally released.'Ministers are under intense pressure from Conservative MPs who see the easing of the two-metre rule as crucial to the further reopening of the economy. Scottish Secretary Alister Jack became the first Cabinet minister - on June 12 - to publicly call for the distance to be reduced to one metre 'as soon as possible', saying the move was vital to 'open up the economy'.And Tory MP Damian Green, who was Theresa May's de facto deputy, said: 'The latest infection rates are encouraging, and the economic figures are frightening, so I think it's time to set a date for a move to one metre.'Only 0.1 per cent of the population now thought to be affected, Government data revealed on Friday. There are now around 5,500 people becoming newly infected each day - a drop from 8,000 the week before. The move comes amid fears of a new wave of job losses as the Government starts to wind down the furlough scheme which has seen the state pay the wages of more than eight million workers.Mr Sunak acknowledged further redundancies were inevitable and said that it underlined the importance of getting the economy going again.'Primarily we need to reopen our economy safely and slowly. That is the most important thing to try and safeguard as many of those jobs as possible,' he told The Andrew Marr Show. 'There is going to be hardship ahead. People are going to lose their jobs.' Meanwhile, ministers have faced fresh criticism over their failure to get more schools in England to reopen, with most pupils set to stay home until September. The Children's Commissioner for England Anne Longfield said they risked undermining children's basic right to an education. 'It has taken 200 years of campaigning to get children into the classroom, ensuring that education was a basic right for all children,' she told the Observer. 'We seem for the first time to be prepared to let that start go into reverse. And I think that is a very, very dangerous place to be.'Ministers will this week mount a fresh push to get more primary school children back into the classroom ahead of the summer break. Currently, primary schools in England - which closed following the coronavirus lockdown in March - are opening to pupils in Reception, Year 1 and Year 6. However, ministers will this week reaffirm schools can take children from other year groups provided they have the capacity to do so safely. It means limiting class sizes to just 15 while ensuring protective measures are in place to prevent the spread of the coronavirus.A No 10 source said Mr Johnson was 'acutely aware' of the impact the extended closure was having on pupils and was working with Education Secretary Gavin Williamson on a major 'catch-up' plan.

96,"The Coalition says Australia needs more science and maths graduates. But does the funding add up?;The government says it wants fewer students doing humanities and law, however the effect of its package could be quite different","June 23, 2020 Tuesday",International,The Guardian (London),1104,1104,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,Daniel Hurst,"The Coalition says Australia needs more science and maths graduates. But does the funding add up?The government says it wants fewer students doing humanities and law, however the effect of its package could be quite different","The Australian government has promoted its planned overhaul of university funding as an incentive for students to move away from humanities courses and towards those deemed more likely to result in a job at the end of their studies, including teaching, nursing, maths, science and engineering.The initial focus of last Friday's announcement was on the large increase in fees for students who wish to enrol in humanities and law degrees, but closer examination of the package shows that it may not encourage universities to create more places for other courses, and that it will reduce federal funding available to each course on average.The package is incredibly complex and the sector is still trying to work out precisely how it affects universities and their students.Here are the key areas where the effects of the announcement may vary from the intentions the government said it was pursuing.                   1. The government is cutting funding, on average                   The government says the changes will mean some students pay less and others pay more. But taken as a whole, the average government contribution towards commonwealth-supported places will decline.At present, the government contributes about 58% and the student pays the remaining 42% of the $20,597 average cost of a degree. A government discussion paper indicates the commonwealth share will decline to 52% on average. And the average total funding - including government and student contributions - will go down to $19,389.This has echoes of the Coalition government's ill-fated package to deregulate university fees in 2014, when the then education minister, Christopher Pyne, argued that moving from a 60:40 split in government-student contributions to 50:50 was fair.                   2. The impact on overall funding doesn't always match up with the government's rhetoric on priority study areas                   The impact of the latest proposal varies depending on the subject area, but it's worth focusing on the total of government and student contributions. Contrary to the government's rhetoric, the humanities are set to experience big raw-dollar value increases in total available funding per place, driven by the big increase in student fees - arguably providing an incentive for universities to enrol more of those students. (As is current practice, the student contribution can be deferred through Hecs-Help, allowing students to wait until they have entered the workforce to start paying back their uni debts.)However, education, nursing, allied health, clinical psychology, agriculture, mathematics, engineering, science, environmental studies and medical science will all receive less available funding per place. While the priority areas have cuts in student fees in a bid to ""incentivise"" students to take up those courses, the total available funding available to universities for those places is the important factor when it comes to higher education budgets and priorities.The total of the student and commonwealth contribution shows how much cash is available to fund a student place in a particular study area.The key is that final number marked ""Total difference"". If there is a minus before the number, it means the total student and government funding available for a place in that field is going down by that amount. If there's no minus, the total available is increasing by that amount.Even though the education minister, Dan Tehan, said last week the government wanted to increase the number of graduates in areas of expected employment growth and demand - such as teaching, nursing, agriculture, IT, and science, technology, engineering and mathematics (Stem) - the total funding doesn't always match up with this pledge.The government argues its new funding model is better linked to the cost of universities delivering those particular subject areas. In a discussion paper, it argues the latest analysis shows some fields - including social studies, science, behavioural science, creative arts, nursing and education - are currently over-funded on average, whereas law, commerce, accounting, management and agriculture are all under-funded on average.                   3. How does this fit in with employment and salary outcomes - and will it make a difference?                   Tehan has argued the government wants to increase the pool of ""job-ready"" graduates. However, the following graph shows humanities, culture and social sciences graduates have similar job outcomes to science and mathematics graduates.And what about salaries? Some observers have argued that eventual salaries post-graduation may be a more important factor in students deciding what to study, given that the Hecs-Help scheme allows students to defer their contributions. Latest data show dentistry and medicine have best salary outcomes while creative arts and hospitality have some of the lowest salary outcomes among graduates - information that prospective students may already take into account when they nominate their course preferences.                   4. With the government cutting the overall funding on average, how is it using that spare money?                   The government argues its funding overhaul will allow it to pursue some important measures to increase access to higher education.As the Guardian reported last week, the sweeteners include funding for an extra 39,000 university places by 2023. Other measures include:•$900m for an ""industry linkage fund"" for investment in science, technology, engineering and maths education;•$500m to support Indigenous, regional and low socioeconomic students attending university;•new $5,000 grants to students from outer regional and remote areas to help pay relocation costs;•a $50m research fund for regional universities and industry partners.There is an interesting shift in the focus of the Higher Education Participation and Partnerships Program (HEPPP). As the following graph shows, the program currently provides help for students from low socio-economic status backgrounds. This will be broadened to support regional and remote students and Indigenous students in addition to students from low SES backgrounds.Tehan has confirmed while the government's overall $18bn investment in the sector would grow in line with inflation, the latest package is budget neutral. This confirmation is important, because it means the new measures are funded by cuts elsewhere (including the reduction in overall government funding per student place). This could weigh on the minds of Senate crossbenchers as they consider how they will vote on forthcoming legislation.",Newspaper
97,THE LESSONS OF LOCKDOWN;COVID-19 HAS HAD A SEISMIC EFFECT ON MANY PEOPLE'S BANK BALANCES. ROSIE MURRAY-WEST FINDS OUT WHAT THIS MEANS GOING FORWARD,"July 6, 2020 Monday",International,Metro (UK),1924,1924,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,,THE LESSONS OF LOCKDOWNCOVID-19 HAS HAD A SEISMIC EFFECT ON MANY PEOPLE'S BANK BALANCES. ROSIE MURRAY-WEST FINDS OUT WHAT THIS MEANS GOING FORWARD,"COVID-19 has had a profound impact on our bank balances, with individuals sitting on two sides of a huge divide. While some have found that they've more cash than ever, thanks to the lack of commuting and expensive evenings out, others are furloughed on low wages or have lost work altogether.'The virus is having unequal financial impacts,' explains behavioural scientist Jessica Exton from ING Bank. The bank's research found that while many people have managed to save more since lockdown, those who had few savings to start with were saving less than before.'The financial divide between those who have a savings buffer and those living from month to month may increase even further in the wake of lockdown,' Jessica adds.Whichever side of the divide you are on, the sudden - and shocking - events so far in 2020 have important financial lessons for us all. As we emerge blinking into the sunlight, here are some financial lessons to take from our recent experiences.Everyone needs a buffer With interest rates at record lows in recent years, saving has scarcely been a fashionable or lucrative option. But sudden shocks like the coronavirus lockdown exposed the vulnerabilities of those with no 'rainy day' fund.'The crisis has also shown us what an enormous difference it can make to have emergency savings to fall back on,' says Sarah Coles, personal finance expert from Hargreaves Lansdown.'Around one in four people have been wrestling with changes in their circumstances - most of whom have seen their income fall. Those who had an emergency savings safety net have found it far easier to soldier on.' Sarah recommends storing money in an easy access savings account, so that you can get to it as soon as you need it. These have very low interest rates right now, with the best paying being ICICI Bank's one per cent SuperSaver account and NS&I's Direct Saver, also paying one per cent, but it's still worth it for the security.'In an ideal world we should all have three to six months' worth of expenses in an easy access account, but as we enter a really uncertain period, may be glad for every penny you're able to put away now,' Sarah adds.Your credit card is a powerful weapon It might seem counter-intuitive to spend on a credit card when life is uncertain, but the Covid-19 lockdown has just exposed the differences and those that don't.Credit card users have Section 75 protection on purchases made on their credit card, which means if a product or service isn't up to scratch, or the company goes bankrupt or is unable to deliver, it's possible to claim the money back from the credit card company.With companies cancelling holidays, flights and theatre tickets, and falling into bankruptcy themselves, Section 75 has been important over the past few months, says Salman Haqqi, personal finance expert at www.money.co.uk, who describes it as 'brilliant to ensure peace of mind'. 'For example, if you bought tickets for an event that got cancelled, you may be able to claim back your travel and hotel costs from your credit card company,' Salman says.Section 75 protection only covers individual purchases over £100 and up to £30,000 - but even if you have just paid a £100 deposit on a credit card, you can claim it back.Before asking your credit card company for your money back, ensure you raise a dispute with the retailer. If your credit card provider rejects your claim, you can take your complaint to the Financial Ombudsman Service, which is free for consumers.Are you insured? It's never been more important Health insurance, life cover and income protection insurance - all of these 'protective' policies have seen a massive rise in interest since lockdown began.Rod Jones, from insurance comparison site ActiveQuote, says the company saw a 'huge surge' in people searching for insurance policies that would protect their income in March, when Covid-19 started to spread more in the UK.Income-protection policies, which pay out if you are made redundant, are currently unavailable since the outbreak, but those who already had them will still receive payouts.'The hope now is that the tide becomes a wave and that, now the benefits have been seen so clearly in recent times, consumers finally begin to put IP in place as a matter of course alongside the rest of their domestic policies in future,' says Rod.There has also been a renewed interest in health insurance, which pays out if you are sick with a number of long-term conditions, and life insurance, which protects your family by paying an income or lump sum if you die. 'The current situation offers a very timely reminder of the fragility of our household finances,' says Gemma Harle, managing director of the mortgage and financial planning network at Quilter Financial Planning.'Too many people insure their possessions and forget to insure their biggest asset, which is themselves. Nobody wants to consider how they and their family might cope under difficult financial circumstances. But it is important to have those hard conversations,' says Gemma.You can buy these products online using sites like ActiveQuote. If you're unsure of what's right for you under the current circumstances, a financial adviser might be a good place to start. Try www.unbiased.co.uk or www.vouchedfor.com to find an independent adviser near you.Also those planning for a staycation summer shouldn't shirk on the travel cover. With Leicester's local lockdown emphasising how quickly things can change, ensuring you have a comprehensive annual travel policy in place should protect you from unforeseen events. There are still some insurers who will cover for cancellation due to lockdown/illness, but you must always check the terms and conditions.'As the UK continues to navigate the coronavirus pandemic, it's important to have adequate policy coverage for any trip to make sure you are protected should Government guidance change. Some policies may not cover changes to circumstances,' says Helen Chambers, head of travel insurance at www.moneysupermarket.com.Financial education is vital With huge swathes of the country home schooling our own children, we've finally got to grips with the UK curriculum, and its gaps.Myron Johnson, from Interactive Investor, says that parents are realising that financial education is not compulsory in academies, private schools or faith schools, but is vital for children if they are to have a healthy relationship with money in the future.'With many families now taking a much more hands-on role in home learning, there's more flexibility to talk about money management,' he says.'Sadly, it isn't just adults who worry about money, and learning about budgeting and the value of money can help foster a healthy relationship with money in the future.' Fortunately there are online resources to help us teach our children. Try www.kickstartmoney.co.uk for an online programme, or Experian's online financial education resource, Values, Money And Me, which helps five to 11-year-olds develop their knowledge of money and includes a familylearning programme.Shake up your spending We're all familiar with tricks to cut spending, such as stopping your daily coffee, takeaway lunches and trips to the pub. The trouble is, these changes usually require willpower - unless an extraordinary event like a national lockdown stops our spending patterns.As we return to a more normal life, many people expect to keep up their new frugal habits. A recent survey from the Centre For Economics And Business Research (CEBR) and investment platform eToro found that two-fifths of us want to continue saving as before after lockdown is fully lifted, a process that will require evaluation of which of our old routines we wish to go back to.Pablo Shah, an economist from the Centre For Economics And Business Research (CEBR) says that the lockdown has brought about 'long-standing behavioural shifts', thanks to narrowed spending opportunities, and www.money.co.uk found that Brits managed to save on average £396 in the first six weeks of the lockdown.Continuing with saving will require willpower as hospitality reopens. Salman suggests using free planning tools and apps such as Money Dashboard, Moneyhub and Yolt, to 'I'm teaching my daughter how to manage money' LOCKDOWN has given education consultant Melanie Harwood the opportunity to teach her daughter, Hannah-Jane, how to earn and manage cash. The 12-year-old has been getting up at 6am to feed, clean and take care of the 14 ex-battery hens the family have acquired, while she's set up a business selling organic free-range eggs to the neighbours.'We cannot possibly eat the 11 or 12 eggs laid every day,' explains education entrepreneur Melanie, from Hitchin, Hertfordshire, adding that Hannah-Jane came up with the idea of selling the excess.'She even wrote the letters to the householders in our local area by hand, herself. She wanted to know how to open a bank account to keep her money ""safe"".'She now has her very own weekly customers that pay her £8 up front each month for six eggs each week. She is earning £60 a month! This was all her own idea and you should have seen her face when she saw the balance of her first ever bank account.'My dear old mum has been instrumental in guiding her and supporting her throughout this learning journey. I am superimpressed and very proud,' adds Melanie.'My spending habits will never go back to the old normal' Karen Webber, from Stockport, has been amazed by how little she's spent during lockdown, and believes that she'll never go back to her old ways.'My biggest lesson from lockdown is that we can be OK with much less,' says Karen, who owns ethical marketing business Goodness Marketing.Karen, 40, Chris, 38, and sons Caleb and Lucas (aged nine and four) have enjoyed smaller pleasures that haven't hit their wallets.'I was putting a lot of pressure on myself buying new toys and planning days out for the children, but they were no happier. They are as happy building a den and watching a film on television as they are going to the cinema.'We've saved money during the lockdown, and that's partly because we've not been commuting and not paying for childcare, and my husband hasn't been spending £6 on lunches.'We've also learned to spend what money we do have in our community, in the local shops that have supported us rather than spending with big chains.' 'I believe that lockdown has taught us a simpler way to be, and I want to keep that up.' 'We're stockpiling a six-month savings cushion' FOR Alexandra Watson, the Covid-19 lockdown emphasised her financial vulnerability. Together with her husband Scott, she had been building up a flameless candles business called Wickfree.With most of the sales made through parties, she expected to lose her income overnight when social distancing was brought in. 'We've actually been really fortunate, because people have bought more than we expected,' she says. 'But we realised that just because it was OK this time, doesn't mean it will work out for us next time.' Alexandra and Scott, from Nantwich, Cheshire, had just bought a dream home to share with their daughter, six-year-old Theia. To ensure that they feel secure in it, they've set a target to save six months of their financial outgoings - something they before the pandemic.'Knowing our home is secure and our little girl is secure, and that we can pivot if we need to is really important now.' 'Covid-19 has made everyone think about their health, but they should think about their financial health too,' Alexandra, 46, says.",Newspaper
98,"Almost a QUARTER of Britons drank alcohol at least four times a week during lockdown - up from 14% before Covid-19, study finds","June 29, 2020 Monday",International,MailOnline,1098,1098,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,Connor Boyd Health Reporter For Mailonline,"Almost a QUARTER of Britons drank alcohol at least four times a week during lockdown - up from 14% before Covid-19, study finds","•Maynooth University in Ireland found problem drinking was on the rise in the UK•Brits binge drinking at least once week also rose from 10% to 17% in April at peak•Boris faced backlash for keeping gyms shut but allowing pubs and bars to openThe number of Britons drinking alcohol at 'problematic' levels has risen dramatically during the coronavirus lockdown, research suggests. Data from nearly 12,000 Britons revealed almost a quarter of adults were drinking more than four days a week in lockdown. In comparison, the rate was just 14.2 per cent pre-pandemic. The number of Brits binge drinking at least once a week has also risen from 10 per cent to 17 per cent during the coronavirus crisis. And separate data also analysed as part of the study showed a similar spike in drinking among Americans.Researchers behind the study said the pandemic was fuelling problematic drinking among people who were likely looking 'to alleviate distress and worry'.It comes after Prime Minister Boris Johnson faced backlash for keeping gyms shut but allowing England's pubs and bars to reopen from this Saturday.Excessive alcohol consumption can batter the immune system and leave people more prone to infections, including Covid-19. Exercise, on the other hand, boosts the body's defence mechanism.                     The study - which hasn't yet been peer-reviewed or scrutinised by other scientists - looked 12,594 Britons involved in the the UK Household Longitudinal Study.Participants were quizzed about their drinking habits in April, at the peak of the UK's epidemic, when the country was in the strictest phase of lockdown. Their answers were compared with responses given between 2017 and 2019.The survey found 23 per cent of adults were consuming alcohol on four or more days in April, up from 14.2 per cent before coronavirus hit the UK.                     Two-thirds of Britons have piled on the pounds during lockdown                    Two in three Britons admit they have piled on the pounds during the two-month coronavirus lockdown - putting them more at risk of the viral disease.A third of the population has gained half a stone or more in the eight weeks since all but essential travel was banned and exercise was limited.According to the survey of 1,000 Britons, one in 20 said they had put on so much weight they were too 'scared' to stand on the scales.The worrying finding comes after NHS data revealed obese people are more likely to die from COVID-19.Analysis of 17,000 NHS admissions found that death rates were almost 40 per cent higher in patients with a BMI over 30.Those who are overweight and unfit have lower lung capacity than healthy people, which makes it hard to get oxygen and blood around the body.When COVID-19 strikes it makes it more difficult to breath and blocks the flow of oxygen even more, which eventually overwhelms the bodies of obese people.This is the reason why overweight and obese people in intensive care are more likely to need assistance with breathing and support with kidney function, experts say.The latest survey, commissioned by Slimfast, revealed it was young people and women who were mostly gaining weight.The study did not reveal how many units of alcohol were consumed on average by respondents, but the NHS says adults should not drink more than 14 units a week.This is about the equivalent of six pints, or seven small glasses of wine, over a seven-day period.The poll also found that heavy drinking at least once a week rose from 9.7 per cent in 2017 and 2019 to 16.6 per cent in April.Heavy drinking was defined as consuming more than eight units for a man and six for a woman in a single sitting - the same as four pints or two large glasses of wine. The increase in frequent and heavy drinking was sharpest in those in middle age, with 11 per cent more adults between 35 and 49 upping their alcohol consumption. This was followed by those aged between 18 and 34 (10 per cent). Large rises in frequent drinking were also most common in middle income families and high income families (10 per cent). Professor Michael Daly, a psychologist at Maynooth University in Ireland, wrote in the study: 'There are a number of plausible mechanisms that may explain population-wide increases in problem drinking. 'The Covid-19 crisis is thought to have had a considerable burden on population level mental health and this may have resulted in an increase in people using alcohol to cope with stress and negative affect.'Social lockdown measures have resulted in restrictions in travel, leisure time and physical social engagement, which for many may have resulted in increased boredom. 'Boredom is thought to have a range of effects on behavior and boredom proneness is linked to higher alcohol consumption, which may in part explain why alcohol use has increased alongside the introduction of social lockdown measures.' The study was co-authored by Dr Eric Robinson, a behavioural scientist at Liverpool University.It comes after UK leisure chiefs slammed 'completely illogical' plans to keep gyms, swimming pools and sports centres closed while pubs reopen next Saturday.Bosses said it was 'a strange 'war on obesity' that sees pubs and restaurants open before gyms' after Ministers said they hope to reopen indoor centres in mid-July.'Close proximity' businesses including nightclubs, casinos, soft play centres, indoor gyms, nail bars and beauty salons will also remain shut, as well as bowling alleys.Gym chiefs at UK chains said letting pubs and restaurants reopen while keeping exercise facilities closed could lead to people becoming more at risk of Covid-19.More than 100,000 people have signed a petition urging the Government to 'rethink' their decision to keep gyms shut and to 'come to an agreement to reopen them'Glenn Earlam, chief executive of David Lloyd Clubs, which has 100 venues across Britain, said it was a 'completely illogical' move to open pubs first on July 4.He said: 'So what we hear is that pubs and restaurants will be able to reopen, but health and fitness facilities won't be able to.'To us this is bizarre because we are part of the solution. If people come to health and fitness facilities it helps boost their immune system.'The chief medical officer has regularly said that health and fitness is one of the best things you can do to protect yourself from Covid-19.'A spokesman for PureGym, one of the UK's largest operators with more than one million members, said: 'We understand that these decisions are not easy, but it is a strange 'war on obesity' that sees pubs and restaurants open before gyms.",Web Publication

Today is also the day that travellers from a long list of approved countries may now enter England without having to isolate for 14 days. Opposition MPs sound nervous about the pace at which the lockdown is being lifted, and it is notable that they are more likely to be wearing masks around parliament than Conservative MPs. Anneliese Dodds, the shadow chancellor (although I haven't seen her wearing a mask), made the important point in responding to the ""summer economic update"" that all of the measures in it would be irrelevant if there were a significant second wave of the disease. As if on cue, WHO added to the sense of foreboding with its warning, giving one newspaper a front page of contrasting headlines: ""Coronavirus pandemic is accelerating, warns WHO"" and ""Gyms and swimming pools get set to reopen."" However, the words of the director-general of WHO referred to ""most of the world"", with Europe and China being big exceptions. And the word ""accelerating"" referred to the number of cases that are confirmed every day, which is distorted by the increasing number of tests. The only certain measure, as Professor Chris Whitty, the chief medical officer of England, said, is excess deaths - that is, a higher number of deaths than would be expected. On that measure Europe is mostly back to normal, with the possible exception of Spain, where it seems to be difficult to compile reliable figures. Globally, there is no doubt that the number of daily deaths is increasing (although not accelerating) in Latin America, but the trends elsewhere are mixed. One of the problems is that the deaths figures lag infections by about two weeks. The big puzzle is what is happening in the US, where the number of cases has been increasing for the past month while the number of deaths has been falling. The New York Times reports today an increase in the number of deaths in the past few days, which may be the delayed effect of premature easing of lockdowns in some states, but it is too early to tell. The picture in Europe is quite different. Countries such as Italy, which eased its lockdown in May, and even Sweden, which never imposed severe restrictions at all, have not seen a resurgence of cases or deaths.There is still so much that we do not know about the disease, but the unknown risks of a second wave have to be weighed against the known and huge costs of defending against it. Admittedly, there is the problem, which was foreseen by the behavioural scientists long ago at the start of the epidemic, that it will be harder to reimpose lockdown measures once they have been lifted. But it is no use keeping a lockdown - that costs children their education and adults their jobs and livelihoods - ""just in case"". This may not have been the best time for it to be reported that the prime minister has decided to keep Britain out of an EU scheme to procure a vaccine, if one is developed. He has been criticised by Layla Moran, the hyperactive Liberal Democrat leadership candidate, for putting ideology ahead of medical need. However, the more likely explanation is that Johnson thinks it is likely that, if a vaccine is developed, it will be in the UK, and he doesn't want to hand over control of the distribution of it to Brussels. His decision is a blunt reminder, if any were needed, that, although coronavirus is a global problem, the solutions to it are national.",Newspaper; Web Publication

Tory MPs line up to demand PM eases the two-metre rule to save millions of jobs after No10 warns review could take WEEKS - amid fears the contact tracing system is not ready to cope with rise in cases and the app is nowhere to be seen","•Hospitality industry warning million jobs at risk if no decision on 2m next week•Business minister Paul Scully says the government's review will take 'weeks'•Boris Johnson has urged people to shop amid fears economy is being hammeredFurious Tory MPs today lined up to demand immediate easing of the two-metre rule after No10 said a decision might not be taken for 'weeks'.Downing Street played down the chances of a swift change despite warnings millions of jobs are at risk, refusing even to guarantee that it will come before pubs and restaurants are slated to open on July 4. Former Cabinet ministers Iain Duncan Smith and Greg Clark were among the senior figures calling for an overhaul to the social distancing guidelines in the Commons this afternoon, pointing out that other countries were using lower limits. Ex-defence minister Tobias Ellwood said: 'Now is the right time, not in two weeks.' There is a huge push within government to loosen the distance, with Rishi Sunak hailing the 'positive impact' it would have on business and jobs. Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab told the No10 briefing this evening that two metres was not a 'magic' level, while stressing that action had to be 'underpinned' by science.However, there are doubts in government over whether the test and trace system is ready to deal with the potential increase in cases, with the NHS app still on hold over technical and privacy problems. No10 sources flatly denied the problems with the app were delaying a shift on the social distancing guidance.The WHO has cautioned that there should be no further loosening of lockdown until 'robust' contact tracing is in place.                      Easing 2m rule 'will increase risk'                     Easing two-metre rule will increase risk, a top scientist said today. But Dr Michael Tildesley, infectious disease scientist at the University of Warwick, said ministers had to take the economic factors into consideration as well at public health. The Government's two-metre rule is currently under review, as ministers balance public health priorities with enabling more businesses to reopen. Speaking on BBC Breakfast today, Dr Tildesley said: 'The evidence is still slightly unclear - depending upon the studies it could be anything from about twice the risk to 10 times the risk. 'So there is an increase in risk with going down to one metre. 'But I have to stress this is purely based upon public health, and the Government has to consider economic factors before taking a decision.' Boris Johnson said last night that the country is building 'room for manoeuvre' by reducing infection rates. However, scientists and the public still appear to be strongly behind the rule - with suggestions chief medical officer Chris Whitty and science chief Sir Patrick Vallance might even be on 'resignation watch'. The hospitality sector is planning to press the case in a meeting with business minister Paul Scully and local government minister Simon Clarke tomorrow.UK hospitality chief executive Kate Nicholls warned 30,000 to 40,000 firms could start redundancy processes next week, with a million jobs at risk.'If businesses are opening at two-metre social distance, then they're operating at 30 per cent of their normal revenues and for a quarter of our small hospitality businesses they won't be able to open at all,' she told BBC Breakfast. 'If they open at one metre with additional protections to make sure staff and customers are safe, then they can reach 60 per cent to 70 per cent of their normal revenues, and that puts them at break-even. 'So, for many of those businesses it is literally about viability and we know that a third of businesses may not reopen as a result of prolonged closure, and that puts a million jobs at risk across the hospitality sector.' The PM's spokesman said this afternoon that the review will be completed 'in the coming weeks'.It will be led by Simon Case, permanent secretary at Number 10, and will report to the Covid Strategy Committee chaired by Mr Johnson.'It will look at evidence around transmission of the virus in different environments, incidence rates and international comparisons,' the spokesman told a Westminster briefing.'It will draw on advice from scientific and medical experts as well as economists and papers from Sage.'It will take advice from a range of experts including the chief medical officer and the chief scientific adviser.' Challenged that the timetable for the review was as vague as that for the NHS app, the spokesman said: 'I wouldn't make comparisons.' At the daily briefing, Mr Raab insisted a decision on whether to reduce the two-metre rule would be 'underpinned' by science.The Foreign Secretary said: 'There's no magic to one or other particular measure, there will be different levels of risk whether it's at two metres, one-and-a-half metres or one metre.'As we bring the incidence and the transmission rate down, depending on the setting, it's something that can be looked at.'We are still going to make sure that all of the policy judgments that we rightly as politicians take and are accountable for are underpinned by the science.' Government sources denied that the delay to the NHS app - which has been tested on the Isle of Wight for more than a month, but still does not have a timetable for going nationwide - was holding up the two-metre decision.'The decision is not being held up. It started last week and work is ongoing,' a senior source said. In a brutal assault in the Commons this afternoon, Science and Technology committee chair Greg Clark said the findings of the two-metre rule must be published well before July 4.Mr Clark, former business secretary, said: 'What is peculiar about the UK where we've had to have a two-metre rule when almost all other countries, advised by reputable scientists, have had a smaller distance?'He added: 'Many of these countries have a shorter distance rule but require face coverings to be worn. Why is it right for them but wrong for us?'Mr Clark said: 'Will the review consider the total impact on lives and public health of the two-metre rule, including the consequences of people being unable to work.'And finally, vitally, will it conclude in good time before July 4 so that if more businesses are able to open then, including hospitality businesses, they can plan for what social distancing to enforce?'Mr Clark added that the UK should 'apply lessons from the experience of others'.He said: 'Millions of people, workers in pubs, cafes and restaurants and in manufacturing industries, as well as children going to school and young adults in colleges and universities, depend on this decision.'We're fortunate in this country in having some of the very best scientists in the world, but so far our outcomes have not always been the very best in the world.'Therefore ministers, officials and scientists should have the confidence, as good science itself does, to rigorously challenge current thinking and to apply lessons from the experience of others.'Health minister Edward Argar responded: 'We do recognise the importance of getting this information and this decision out there as swiftly as we can because it is important to give businesses all the time we can in order to prepare for it.'But he added that he could not 'set a particular deadline while the work is being done'.Tory former minister Steve Baker told MailOnline that ministers had to weigh up the harm to the economy against the risk of easing the two metre rule. 'The economic harm of sticking with two metres will be profound,' he said. 'And it will be profound in areas that everybody cares about, like going to the pub.'So if the government does insist on two metres when the WHO is saying one, they will have to be very, very clear with the public why those costs are being imposed on everybody.'Mr Baker said it was not right to 'blame scientists'. 'If you are a politician and you have to take a decision then you cannot afford to be cavalier about the economy. Therefore you have to take a balanced judgement and do what you think the public would most want,' he said.'I think the public would accept a range of measures - washing hands , wearing facemasks on transport and so on. If we get towards Christmas and it is getting to be very very difficult to get a meal out or go to a pub because they have gone out of business, I don't think the government would be thanked for that either.'Mr Baker said 'you would have thought' that the app will make the decision easier. 'But of course everything is difficult,' he added.                     UK should not ease 2m rule until test and trace is ready, says WHO                     The UK should not lift lockdown rules until the test and trace system is ready to cope with huge numbers of people, a World Health Organization director has warned.Dr Hans Kluge, the WHO's chief for Europe, said the Government must only take sure-footed steps and not rush into decisions like scrapping the two-metre social distancing rule.He said test and trace must be 'robust' and ready for 'aggressive' use if the number of new cases starts to soar again.Dr Kluge said: 'The key words here are to do it gradually. Do it carefully.'His comments come after data last week showed that the NHS's test and trace system was not able to get co-operation from a third of contacts in its first week.Another senior Tory MP said 'priorities' appeared to be holding up the app. 'It keeps getting pushed back, so there is some internal discussion on how they order this,' they said. The MP added that the app should play a significant role in assuaging concerns about easing lockdown. 'The sooner we can adjust the two metre rule the better,' they said. 'The more we have got mitigation in place the more that life can resume. We all need that to happen.' In a round of broadcast interviews this morning, Mr Scully insisted the timetable for the review would be longer than a few days.'It will take a matter of weeks to do but we want to make sure we get the best scientific advice and we can look at the international comparisons,' he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. 'Clearly you have the likes of Germany, it's one-and-a-half metres, America it is one-metre, and see how those differences land in terms of health guidance.' Mr Scully said the Government did not want to be 'rushed into decisions as we gradually open up the economy'. The Government's advice to stay 2m apart is further than the World Health Organisation's recommendation of at least 1m, and some other countries like France and Denmark.Mr Johnson said: 'As we get the numbers down so it becomes one in 1,000, one in 1,600 maybe even fewer, your chances of being two metres, one metre or even a foot away from someone who has the virus is going down statistically, so you start to build some more margin for manoeuvre.' Mr Sunak confirmed yesterday the Government would 'take a fresh look' at the regulation and suggested the decision was for ministers, not scientists, to take.He told Sky News: 'The Prime Minister has put in place a comprehensive review of the two-metre rule. That review will involve the scientists, economists and others so that we can look at it in the round.'I know that of course it's the difference between three-quarters and maybe a third of pubs opening, for example, so it's important that we look at it.'The Chancellor said any decision on ending the lockdown before a vaccine was ready had an element of 'risk', but pointed out that other countries have lower distance requirements and were still managing to contain the virus.'Now that we have made good progress in suppressing the virus, we're at a different stage of this epidemic than we were at the beginning and that enables us to take a fresh look at this,' he said.'I can very much understand the impact, the positive impact it will have on business's ability to reopen and thereby maintain the jobs that they have.'The new distancing review will take advice from experts including the Prof Whitty and Sir Patrick. The panel will also include behavioural scientists and economists.Mr Sunak suggested that the Government would be prepared to override the views of Sir Patrick and Prof Whitty if they did not agree with a reduction.He told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show that scientists had made clear there is a 'different degree of risk at different levels', and the decision on relaxing the rule was 'ultimately' for ministers to make.He said: 'Much as I would like to see it reduced - everyone would like to see that reduced from an economic perspective - we can only do that if it's safe and responsible to do so.'Former Tory leader Sir Iain Duncan Smith said: 'If other countries are doing it successfully, we need to move now.'Shadow justice secretary David Lammy said Labour would support a relaxation of the 2m rule if the evidence showed it was 'the right time to do it'.",Web Publication

Hospitals are running short of drugs to treat Covid-19, intensive care units are close to capacity, and ventilators are running short.Between 85% and 90% of the very sick and dying are African American.Amid this gathering storm, the city council met to decide whether to require people to wear masks, a basic protection the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) strongly recommends. Doctors lined up to plead their case.""This is beyond an epidemic in this area,"" said the pulmonologist Bill Saliski. ""Our units are full of critically ill covid patients. We have to slow this down.""His colleague, Nina Nelson-Garrett, described watching undertakers carrying out corpses, 30 minutes apart.""Something as simple as a mask can save someone's life,"" she said.Dr Kim McGlothan recounted how she was frequently stopped by white people asking, ""Is the media sensationalizing this, is it really as bad as they are making out?""McGlothan told the council: ""People don't believe the hype. Until you mandate masks, we won't be able to stop this - we just won't.""Then a black resident stood up. Six of his relatives had died from Covid-19. His brother was on a ventilator. ""This is not about masks,"" he said. ""The question on the table is, 'Do black lives matter?' I lost six of my family to Covid. How would it feel if it was your family?""If a pandemic comes through, we do not throw our constitutional rights out the window  Brantley Lyons, councilman    The council debated for two hours. White council members asked if young children could get carbon monoxide poisoning from masks - no, the doctors firmly told them - and spoke portentously about individual rights.""At the end of the day,"" said councilman Brantley Lyons, ""if a pandemic comes through, we do not throw our constitutional rights out the window.""When the vote was called, it divided on largely racial lines. Black members voted for masks, in order to prevent more families losing six loved ones. White members voted against masks, to preserve the fundamental right not to attach a cloth to your face.In a 4-4 tie, the ordinance failed. As he left the chamber, Dr Saliski uttered just one word: ""Unbelievable.""Unbelievable accurately describes America today. The country is on the brink of a huge surge of Covid-19, as the virus tears through the heartlands while the president praises himself for having done "" a great job "" and blithely predicts the scourge will ""            fade away "".Ask Alabama whether the virus is fading away. Or Arizona, Florida, South Carolina or Texas. The disease is venting its fury on these states, which all reopened their economies - with Donald Trump's avid blessing - before the contagion was contained.""Opening while cases are increasing is like leaning into a left hook,"" said Tom Frieden, a former CDC director. ""You are basically asking to get hit - and that's what these states did.""Alabama is enduring a pummeling. It has recorded 32,000 cases and its curve is on a steep upward path.The Republican governor of Texas, Greg Abbott, who ushered in one of the earliest and most aggressive reopenings, insisted a few days ago that his state ""remains wide-open for business"". Yet he has been unable to ignore reality: that the virus has spread its lethal tentacles to            every corner of the state           overwhelming hospitals to the point that            Houston medical centers are running out of ICU beds. Now, once again,            Texas' bars are closing. One town, near Houston, has even brought in a curfew.The Lone Star state recorded 6,584 cases on Wednesday alone - a heart-sinking figure that makes its curve look almost vertical.Florida's malaise would be wryly amusing were so many lives not at stake. On 20 May the conservative magazine the National Review ran the gloating headline : ""Where Does Ron DeSantis Go to Get His Apology?"" The article scolded liberal critics of the Republican governor's lax approach to coronavirus - he famously allowed            beaches to remain open in spring break and has            permitted shops and restaurants to get back to business - for having got it wrong: there was no spike in Florida.On 20 May, Florida's daily infection load stood at 527 new cases. Five weeks later, it reported a record 8,942 on Friday and broke the record again on Saturday with 9,585.                   'It's getting worse, not better'                   Though states such as Florida and Texas are bearing the brunt of the beating, this is not a catastrophe that can be dismissed as the problem of just a few places. Across the nation, at terrifying speed, a similar picture is revealing itself.Every important data point, including positivity rates and hospitalizations, is surging across most states.            A map produced by a team of epidemiologists and health experts, Covid Act Now, shows only four states, all in the north-east, including New York, which used to be at the center of the pandemic but has wrestled it under control, as being on track to contain the disease. Twenty-one states are at risk or facing active or imminent outbreaks.It is troubling enough that the US now has 2.4m confirmed cases - double the number of the next highest country in the world, Brazil, and almost certainly a            huge underestimate. The death toll has passed            12           5,000, with another 20,000 at least expected this month.The death rate is still trending downwards - one bit of positive news in this sorry picture. But deaths lag behind confirmed cases by a month, and that spells trouble ahead.One crumb of comfort had been that for almost three months the daily rate of new infections held steady at around 20,000 cases a day. Then, two weeks ago, the monster began to stir.The tally of new cases ticked upwards, and on Thursday it reached a stomach-churning 40,000 - the worst day on record since the pandemic began.""It's getting worse, not better,"" said Frieden, who now heads the global health initiative Resolve to Save Lives. ""The contrast with other countries is striking. South Korea had 30 cases a day and they flipped out. The US now has 30,000 cases a day and there are people shrugging and saying 'It's no big deal'.""Trump is shrugger-in-chief. When the president lured thousands of non-mask wearing supporters to a viral incubation party - he called it a rally - in Tulsa, Oklahoma, last Saturday, he told them that in his view testing for coronavirus was a ""double-edged sword... When you do testing you are going to find more cases. So I told my people, slow the testing down.""Despite White House efforts to pass the comment off as a joke, it encapsulates the Trump administration's approach towards this devastating crisis. Early on, Trump failed to marshal the full weight of the most powerful government on Earth against the virus. He lost            six critical weeks.When the conversation turns to, 'Why can't we ramp up testing?' there's a sense the White House is not going to be happy  Ashish Jha, Harvard Global Health Institute    Even today, the 500,000 tests being carried out each day falls woefully short of the scale needed. Contact tracing - another crucial tool - is patchy at best, with signs that a growing number of Americans are            unwilling to cooperate.Leading public health experts have watched aghast as Trump has done exactly what he said he would: put a dampener on data-driven efforts that could, over the course of the pandemic, potentially save hundreds of thousands of lives.""Everybody agrees we need a lot more testing,"" said Ashish Jha, director of the Harvard Global Health Institute. ""But when the conversation turns to, 'Why can't we ramp up the testing?' there's always the sense that the White House is not going to be happy to do what's necessary. There's real pushback against scientific leaders calling for action.""Evidence for such a pushback isn't hard to find. There's this week's announcement that the Trump administration will soon end federal funding for 13 testing sites - seven in ravaged Texas.Then there's the ghostlike absence of the CDC, one of the world's leading public health agencies, which has fallen mute at the moment it is most needed. Frieden has become so frustrated by the booming silence of the institution he led for almost eight years, until Trump entered the White House, he has taken to publicising CDC research himself, in a desperate attempt to fill the void.When the Guardian put it to him that this was an extraordinary state of affairs, Frieden replied: ""It feels a bit like North Korea, doesn't it?""The most worrying aspect of the tone being set by Trump is that it is starting to shift the mindset of ordinary Americans. Everywhere you look there are anecdotal signs of people falling in line with the president - shrugging and saying it's no big deal.That trend is very visible in Montgomery. In the end, the town's African American mayor, Steven Reed, overruled the city council's white members and introduced mandatory mask-wearing by executive fiat.But it will be an uphill battle persuading white townsfolk to abide by the ordinance. Brad Harper, a reporter with the Montgomery Advertiser, says he is struck whenever he goes into a Target or Walmart that almost all white shoppers go unmasked while black shoppers have their faces covered.On social media, people rant about masks as ""muzzles"" and ""badges of submission"". ""People get really angry about it, resisting even their doctors asking them to wear it,"" Harper said. ""They don't see a protective device, as something that can save the people around you, they see it as an instrument of control.""All across the country, similar acts of personal rebellion are playing out. Residents of Palm Beach, Florida, erupted in anger against a mandatory mask order, calling it the ""devil's law"" and an affront to ""God's breathing system"".Further up the Florida coast, in Jacksonville Beach, 16 friends decided to have a night out at an Irish pub - the entire group came down with the virus, as well as seven bar workers. A surprise birthday party in Texas led to            18 members of one family being infected.Crowds of unmasked people have been gathering in Las Vegas's reopened casinos, and Covid-19 cases have soared. In Arizona, the Republican sheriff of Pinal county vowed not to enforce the lockdown on grounds of individual liberty, and promptly            contracted the disease himself. Not to mention            Cruisin' Chubbys Gentleman's Club, a strip club in Wisconsin that had its very own outbreak.                   'If you divide people, you allow divide and conquer'                   Everywhere you look there are indications America's social contract - the idea that if we stand united we can defeat this terrible affliction - is breaking down.""If you divide people, you allow divide and conquer,"" Frieden said. ""This is us against them, humans against microbes. The more we are divided, the more microbes will conquer.""Wändi Bruine de Bruin, provost professor of public policy, psychology and behavioral science at the University of Southern California, has been tracking the changing public response since March. Through a rolling survey of 7,000 adults, she has found that most Americans - about 71% - still say they avoid public spaces and crowds. But the proportion is falling, fast, down from 92% in April.She puts the slide down to unclear messaging. ""Messages and policies are no longer consistent. Some businesses are allowed to open, others not, and it's not clear why. That leads to confusion, and anger. Some people start to think it's not fair, others start to assume it's not that important.""Jha said it was vital to acknowledge that most Americans, including many Republicans, have so far been compliant with stay-at-home orders. But he frets that a mindset is taking hold that the virus is somebody else's problem.""I worry that it will take large numbers of people getting very sick, the hospitals filling up, for people to realise this is a pandemic, not a disease outbreak in New York or New Orleans. I hope it doesn't come to that. I worry that it will.""This is a long war and we are losing a lot of battles right now, because we are not fighting them  Tom Frieden    The Guardian asked whether he was concerned about possible public resistance to renewed lockdown orders, should some states be forced back into extreme measures in the face of a Covid-19 explosion.""I do fear that,"" he said. ""For months there has been a concerted effort by a small minority to argue that this is overblown or a hoax. It will be difficult for Republican leaders to get people to change their views on this.""Jha checked himself, then added: ""It's a tiny minority. Unfortunately, it includes the president of the United States.""The good news is that scientists are very clear about what needs to be done. Frieden calls it the three Ws - wear a mask, wash your hands, watch your distance - combined with aggressive testing, contact tracing and isolation of the sick.If such measures can be introduced concertedly and quickly, both at federal and state level, public health experts are confident that all is not lost. The contagion could be contained and the economy slowly and relatively safely rebooted.But time is running out for America.""This is a long war and we are losing a lot of battles right now, because we are not fighting them,"" Frieden said. ""We are going to be paying for the mistakes we make today for months, or even years, to come.""",Newspaper
102,"People should be urged to take day trips, adviser insists;Behavioural scientist says Government should order the reopening of beauty spot car parks and lavatories","May 18, 2020 Monday",International,The Daily Telegraph (London),627,627,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,Robert Mendick,"People should be urged to take day trips, adviser insistsBehavioural scientist says Government should order the reopening of beauty spot car parks and lavatories","BORIS JOHNSON must order councils to open lavatories and car parks to encourage day trippers to get back to the seaside and beauty spots, argues one of the Government's scientific advisers.Professor Robert Dingwall accused the Government of ""terrorising"" the public into staying at home despite evidence which showed a minimal chance of catching Covid-19 when outdoors.The first weekend after the Prime Minister eased the lockdown showed crowds had gathered, even as local authorities urged people to stay away. Ministers have now been urged to be ""more proactive"" in attracting day trippers amid growing fears that Britain's economic recovery will be hindered by a reluctance to venture out after two months of being bombarded by a message to remain indoors.The pressure on local authorities to open up amenities will come later this week when a mini-heatwave is expected to hit the UK, with the hottest day of the year at 27C (81F) anticipated for Wednesday.Tourist boards had joined with local authorities in urging potential visitors to keep away from beauty spots and seaside resorts.Weston-super-Mare for example has changed its slogan from ""Visit Weston"" to ""Don't Visit Weston"", while a number of national parks had made pleas for potential visitors to go elsewhere. Local authorities have closed car parks and shut public lavatories to deter visitors in popular resorts such as Whitby and Scarborough in North Yorkshire.Evidence from the weekend suggested seaside towns such as Brighton remained relatively quiet despite decent weather. In Dorset, the lack of open local authority car parks at many beaches forced motorists to park in ones that were privately owned, creating more crowding. In the Peak District, the national park kept its main car parks shut, causing hikers to park on busy roadside verges instead.Police reports suggested there were only a handful of flash points, in-cluding breaking up a ""rave"" involving 70 people in a park near Telford in Shropshire. ""We are attending a mass gathering/rave,"" Telford police tweeted, adding: ""We have worked so hard and sacrificed so much and this group decide it doesn't apply. I'm shocked that people would care so little. #hangYourHeadsInShame."" Professor Dingwall, who sits on one of the main subcommittees of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), said the crowds had stayed away largely because of local hostility and a lasting terror of catching the coronavirus.""The Government needs to be more proactive and order councils to open lavatories and car parks,"" said Professor Dingwall, a sociologist at Nottingham Trent University who sits on the Government's New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group. Prof Dingwall said ministers needed to be ""pushing"" to ensure the infrastructure is in place to aid the recovery. He is concerned - along with many other behavioural scientists - that Britain has become too fearful of the virus when the risk is ""minimal"" in outdoor settings, and mortality rates remain low for the under-60s.He added: ""The 'stay away' messages coming from a lot of these areas [in seaside resorts and beauty spots] has fed back to the public who are wondering what they can do. I can see a lot of people thinking, 'is this worth it?'.""Then there are the general levels of fear and anxiety. People are worried they won't be safe despite growing evidence that has not been well communicated that there is minimal risk. The Government has been terrorising the population, instilling a state of terror.""The hospitality industry will be alarmed at the public's reluctance to venture out and will be desperate for more amenities to open before the summer season. Travelodge, said it would be ""catastrophic"" if local tourism is not revived in time.",Newspaper
103,Boris Johnson's coronavirus 'roadmap' will only sow confusion;The prime minister's plan to end lockdown is hopelessly impractical and contradictory Coronavirus - latest updatesSee all our coronavirus coverage,"May 11, 2020 Monday",International,The Guardian (London),972,972,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,Zoe Williams,Boris Johnson's coronavirus 'roadmap' will only sow confusionThe prime minister's plan to end lockdown is hopelessly impractical and contradictory Coronavirus - latest updatesSee all our coronavirus coverage,"The prime minister came before the country promising the "" first sketch of a roadmap ""; it was a wheedling, essay crisis phrase (let it not be said that I haven't done it, since here is a sketch of it), and one of the frustrations of advising Boris Johnson must surely be that, however well thought out            the plan, whatever he says he always sounds like he's made it up on the spot. But there were tangible points in there, and new announcements.The Covid-19 alert system was novel: he announced it in backwards order, so it was like a 70s computer game, Hunt the Point. Level one was ""disease no longer present""; level five was critical; level four was what we got ourselves into with our strenuous lockdown efforts; level three was what we were going into now; level two didn't seem to really exist. Better representations appeared in newspapers, to which all wheezes are briefed ahead and then, following outcry from one stakeholder or another, denied.Still, for any practical purposes, they didn't mean anything. If level two is ""initial alert"", what action does that demand? On the government's own record, none. If level three is ""need to be on our guard, but safe to lift some lockdown restrictions"", we return to the puzzle of the "" stay alert "" slogan: what does it mean, in relation to an invisible foe? Alice Bennett, an academic, put together a            terrifically helpful timeline on Twitter of ""stay alert"" messages across the history of state propaganda which culminated (for me, at least) in the marvellous Soviet-era injunction, ""You have no right to relax your attention! Every minute be on the alert."" Broadly, Bennett concluded, these messages put a responsibility on the individual that is utterly unactionable. You cannot know that you've fallen short in your duties until the infection rate goes up, whereupon it is your fault. If it doesn't go up, well done, meerkat nation. Level four is ""NHS under pressure"", which could be any point, really, since Andrew Lansley became health secretary, and level five is ""NHS is overwhelmed"" which was also (keep up at the back) one of the speech's five tests (is the NHS overwhelmed?). To be fair, terrorist alert levels - from which this system seems to derive - probably didn't have much more flesh on their bones, but at least we weren't looking to them for information on when we could next see and touch the people we love.It reminded me of the parent who enjoys authority for its own sake so much that they land at these circular, riddle-like positions: you can have a phone when you've proved you're responsible enough for a phone. Yet it was delivered with that fecklessness for which Johnson is famed, so simultaneously it was like being told by a cowboy builder that phase two would commence right after the unknowable end of phase one. The rackety autocrat is such an enraging political entity - either be jokey and beg our patience, or be bossy and competent. You cannot be both.When it came to the practicalities of the announcement, Careless Boris won out: everyone whose work can't be done at home should now go back to work. Employees in manufacturing and construction are, by these terms, due in on Wednesday. Duties will be placed on their employers to keep them safe, but what are those duties, how are they enforced, what about workers who themselves are in vulnerable groups, and what rights do workers have if they don't think their workplace is safe?Employees shouldn't take public transport, they should walk, cycle or drive, but if they must take public transport, does that mean they shouldn't work? It's part-way down the path of giving up on governing altogether: ""Don't use the infrastructure, use your feet. While staying alert."" Fines for people breaking the rules will be increased, but to what, and what were they before? Children in years one and six could be back at school straight after half term, so long as they stay alert in relation to R + number of infections in the meantime. I heard some half-hearted intention to get selected secondary-school children back before the end of the year, though no clarity on whether that meant the calendar or academic year. A caller to Radio 5 Live heard ""September at the earliest"". Nowhere was there any detail on the safety of teachers.I'm no nudge unit, but I feel moved to point out: people who have been celibate since they started self-isolating from their non-cohabiting partner seven weeks ago are going to be asking why their predicament is less important than someone going back to the shop floor to make aerospace parts that we can't imagine using. People missing their extended families are going to wonder why they're being praised for their great sense of shared humanity on the one hand, while their own needs as human beings are ignored and the educational prospects of five-year-olds (no offence, five-year-olds) are prioritised. In what imaginable universe is golf more important than playgrounds?A staggered end to lockdown is an incredibly delicate act of persuasion, which rests on principles of honesty and logic that can be followed. We have, instead, persistent dishonesty (""literally hundreds of thousands of tests per day"", Johnson promised at one point, surely sticking to no script except maybe one he dreamed) and a culture of ""don't worry your pretty head, we'll make the hard choices"". It is a thin line between predicting the breakdown of public buy-in and preaching civil disobedience. It is self-evident that we cannot disregard the advice altogether; that we cannot each lift the lockdown unilaterally in despair at the incompetence of the people enforcing it. Yet there is something so unsettling about waiting for scraps of sense from the table of people who themselves, one feels, are so starved of insight. Zoe Williams is a Guardian columnist",Newspaper
104,Johnson should have been alert to mixed messaging,"May 11, 2020 Monday",International,The Independent (United Kingdom),781,781,England & Wales,EDITORIAL,Johnson should have been alert to mixed messaging,"From the moment the government's new coronavirus slogan first emerged, there was criticism.Then, yesterday lunchtime, in a somewhat more serious intervention, it was aggressively disowned by Scotland's first minister Nicola Sturgeon. Arlene Foster, her Northern Ireland counterpart, also said officials from the region would not be deviating from the original message. WhileWales's health minister, Vaughan Gething, tweeted there had not been a ""four-nations agreement"" aboutany change.So just for England then, ""stay home"" has been replaced with ""stay alert"". The second message is no longer ""protect the NHS"" but ""control the virus"". Part three is still ""save lives"". The disagreement- with the stay-at-home regulations beingcontrolled by each devolved government - is a highly undesirable state of affairs for life in this country.Coronavirus has done precious little to depolarise the UK. There are millions, tens of millions even, who loathe Boris Johnson, and who will pass up no opportunity to take the most damning reading of anything the government does. But even the most generous judges would find it hard to conclude that the new messaging is poor. What does ""stay alert"" mean? Nicola Sturgeon was asked this very question, to which her reply was, ""I don't know.""Tory MPshave been busily explaining how obvious it is what the new sloganmeans. It means, apparently, follow the rules. The communities and local government secretary, Robert Jenrick, has said that it means ""stay at home as much as possible"".We have subsequently been given explanatory notes as to exactly what ""stay alert"" means. But if you have to explain what a slogan means, then clearly the slogan hasn't worked. There is a reason topadvertising agencies are paid huge sums of money,often to produce little more than half a sentence.Leaving someone with no doubt as to what's required of them, while taking up no more than two or three seconds of their attention, is a difficult business - and the government has got it rather badly wrong. As for ""control the virus"" - the entire point is that the virus is invisible. Manypeople have likely already had it pass through them, asymptomatically. Others have it within them currently, but will not know for some time.In a sense, the last days have vindicated what might have been wrongly perceived as mistakes by the government several weeks ago. It does appear that the concerns of the so-called nudge unit might not have been without merit. That lockdown had to be timed right, so that people would not tire of it at the wrong moment. And people do seem to be tiring oflockdown, and are taking more risks with their own behaviour. But that is why it is not a time for increased ambiguity about what behaviour might be possible.Nicola Sturgeon is regularly praised as a highly able and effective politician, which she is. But not all aspects of being a politician are entirely noble. When she said on yesterdaythat it was not sustainable for the leaders of the two governments to read of each other's plans ""in the pages of the newspapers"", she did not mention that, on previous occasions, she has taken it upon herself to announce UK-wide government policy hours before the prime minister has had the chance.A politician's primary duty is to keep their people safe, and if there is an opportunity to claim to be doing this while taking a swing at your opponents, an effective politician will certainly take it, as Ms Sturgeon has done.Ultimately, the most significant news that has emerged in the last few days are the views of two scientists. The first was Sweden's Anders Tegnell, who has defended the no-lockdown policy in his country, for which he bears responsibility, claiming that lockdowns will, in the end, achieve very little. That, in the end, they will have to be eased, and all countries, regardless of policy, will come to have very similar fatality rates.The second was from the virologist Peter Piot, director of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, who advises the European Commission on coronavirus and almost died from it himself. ""Let's clear,"" he wrote. ""Without a coronavirus vaccine, we will never be able to live normally again ??? and it is still not even certain that developing a Covid-19 vaccine is possible.""Ultimately, no one has a roadmap out of this crisis, and the tweaking of government slogans is scarcely even worthy of a signpost along the way. Until this point, however, people did at least appear to have some understanding of what they should and shouldn't be doing, even if some chose to ignore it.At the moment, all that is certain is uncertainty. It is hardly the time to introduce even more ambiguity.",Newspaper
105,The politicians who played the Covid-19 crisis badly,"July 4, 2020 Saturday",International,"Financial Times (London, England)",908,908,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,Simon Kuper,The politicians who played the Covid-19 crisis badly,"B olsonaro, Trump and Johnson: these are men you wouldn't put in charge of containing an outbreak of acne,"" writes Ferdinand Mount, former head of Margaret Thatcher's Downing Street policy unit, in the London Review of Books.It is a shocking story. The US, UK and Brazil weren't among the first countries hit by Covid-19, so they had time to prepare. Admittedly, the health of ordinary Americans isn't a Republican priority, but the US still spends as much on public healthcare as other developed countries. Add in private healthcare, and it spends more than any society in history. Yet American and Brazilian cases of Covid-19 are soaring as Europe's and China's fall, while the UK has Europe's secondhighest excess mortality rate. Within the US, states with ample time to prepare - Florida, Texas, Arizona - are now in full pandemic. Their governors, like Donald Trump, initially claimed to be prioritising the economy over the virus. Instead, they mismanaged both. Few people will risk dangerous illness to get a haircut.All these places are ruled by mediagenic rightwing nationalists sceptical of credentialed experts.So are badly hit India, Russia and Belarus. A social democracy can also mismanage Covid-19, as Sweden did, but it's rarer. Why has this new category of leader got the virus wrong? It starts with the attention economy.In an era of social media and non-stop news from endless media outlets, the politicians who get most attention are those who create memorable, unusual, supposedly ""authentic"" characters for themselves. This system rewards narcissists, and what the philosopher Harry Frankfurt calls ""bullshitters"": people distinct from liars in that they have no interest in what's true or not. They just say what sounds good. Their high verbal intelligence reduces their need for analytic intelligence.Illustration: Harry Haysom Once elected, the leader immediately experiences hubris and boredom. For past leaders, this moment arrived only after about five years in office - the time it took for Tony Blair to decide to invade Iraq and David Cameron to call a referendum on Brexit. But those politicians thought their job was governing. The new men are communicators. For them, the game was the election; governing is the tedious epilogue.Success breeds overconfidence. You silenced the doomsayers by winning the country's biggest prize. How hard can governing be? You know the previous incumbents were idiots. So you avoid expert briefings, disband pandemic units and celebrate your triumph with continual holidays.When your scientific advisers mention a boring illness in Wuhan, you ignore them. When it spreads to Italy and New York, your nationalism or red-state exceptionalism tells you that it won't happen here. Arizona's governor Doug Ducey wouldn't let mayors make masks compulsory.You are confident because you know nothing about the complexity of governing. Psychologists call this the Dunning-Kruger effect: incompetent people don't realise their own incompetence. You are confident the virus won't hit your citizens and it certainly won't hit you, the chosen one. Bolsonaro, Trump and Johnson (until he got ill) acted out their sense of immunity by shaking hands in public, setting an example for their followers.Johnson's adviser Dominic Cummings displays his own version of exceptionalism: his unexpected victory in the Brexit referendum proved that he is smarter than anybody else. That entitles him to ignore the advice of scientists and the rules against driving across the country during lockdown.When the illness reaches your country, your communicational instincts kick in. Your scientific advisers want to give dull, repetitive, depressing briefings about locking down for the long haul. You need a better script. So you delay lockdown for fatal weeks, constantly proclaim victory over the virus, seek attention (in Trump's case) by recommending bleach injections and reopen www.early.No matter that reality - an overrated entity - will soon contradict proclamations of victory. Your timeframe is now. In the attention economy, as you learnt getting elected, even a news cycle is a long time in politics. What counts is scoring this minute - let this evening worry about itself.Your election victory showed you that many voters will believe anything. In fact, a large subgroup will identify with the ignoramus over the egghead. Trump and Johnson have weaponised the insight of behavioural economists that humans aren't rational beings pursuing self-interest. In a divided polity, most of your supporters will overlook incompetence (even if it kills grandpa) rather than switch teams.Most of your cabinet members will back whatever you do. You chose them for loyalty, not for their competence at sourcing PPE. You have also gotten rid of trendy diversity: Trump and Bolsonaro surround themselves with rich white men (ideally relatives), Johnson's inner set is overwhelmingly male, private school and Oxford. Groupthink is the aim. If that makes it harder to correct the leader's mistakes, well, you'll take it. Just in case Britain's civil servants have other ideas, Cummings is now taking back control.It could be that the coronavirus ends the ride for ignorant nationalist bullshitters. However, they have shown before that they can defeat reality.@KuperSimon; simon.kuper@ft.comBolsonaro, Trump and Johnson - until he got ill - acted out their sense of immunity by continuing to shake hands in public",Newspaper

He said the 13 per cent decline was 'good news' but the city must remain in its local lockdown - which began last week - until at least July 18, when health chiefs first promised it would be re-evaluated.Leicester was the first place in Britain to have local restrictions enforced to tackle a surge in Covid-19 cases, now thought to be linked to working conditions in clothes factories.Schools and non-essential shops were ordered to close again last week and people prevented from meeting up in groups or going to others' houses, despite the rest of the nation finally being allowed to celebrate the relaxation of lockdown. Mr Hancock said: 'We took, last week, difficult but vital decisions about Leicester. 'Since then we've been working with Leicester and Leicestershire and I'm pleased to say that, together, we have brought down the seven-day infection rate from 135 to 117 cases per 100,0000 people.'What we said when we took the measures just over a week ago is that we needed to see 14 days of data, so we propose to make announcements on the next steps on the 18th of July. 'Of course, if further measures are needed in the meantime to tighten up then we will take them immediately, but... the good news is that the data are currently moving in the right direction.'Mr Hancock said he would not put a number on how far the infection rate had to fall before the lockdown would be lifted.His counterpart, Labour's Shadow Health Secretary Jonathan Ashworth, said in Germany officials use a benchmark of 50 cases of Covid-19 per 100,000.Mr Hancock replied: 'We're not going to use or give a specific figure because both the level and the rate of change matters.                     WHICH LOCAL AUTHORITIES HAVE HIGHEST RATES OF COVID-19 INFECTION? (Data from June 28)                   •Leicester 141.3 cases per 100,000 people•Bradford 45.8•Barnsley 35.1•Rochdale 35.0•Oldham 30.1•Kirklees 26.2•Rotherham 26.1•Sheffield 24.4•Bolton 23.5•Doncaster 21.3•Blackburn with Darwen 20.8•Knowsley 20.1•Peterborough 18.9•Bedford 18.1•Manchester 17.5•Leicestershire 17.3•Tameside 16.9•Luton 15.0•Calderdale 14.8•Stoke-on-Trent 14.1•Blackpool 13.6•Derby 12.8•Hammersmith & Fulham 12.4•Leeds 11.7•Cheshire East 11.3'If the level were lower but it was going up, that could be a worse situation than a higher level that is under control and falling. So you've got to look at both the level and the rate of change.'Leicester went into lockdown when figures from July 2 showed it had an infection rate of 141 Covid-19 cases per 100,000 people - three times higher than the next highest local area.As well as police and Public Health England medical officials, a team of behavioural scientists have been deployed to provide advice if social distancing is not adhered to. A blame game between local and central government has been raging for the past fortnight, with the mayor of the city, Sir Peter Soulsby, complaining that figures for both positive and negative test results, along with ethnicity and workplace, broken down by postcode, were not coming through.'We've asked repeatedly but have just been told we're being given all we need,' he said. A PHE report into the spike revealed it could be partly due to the growth in the availability of testing.In his speech in the Commons today Mr Hancock also praised the actions of three pubs in England which closed after customers tested positive after 'Super Saturday'. The Lighthouse in Burnham-on-Sea, Somerset; the Fox and Hounds in Batley, West Yorkshire; and The Village Home in Gosport, Hampshire, were 'doing the right thing by their customers and by their communities', he said.Mr Hancock said: 'This is NHS Test and Trace working precisely as intended. Three pubs shut so that others can be open.'He had opened his speech by saying: 'We are bringing this virus under control'.In his remarks to fellow MPs the Health Secretary deflected calls for an apology from people lashing out at Prime Minister Boris Johnson's remarks about care homes yesterday.Mr Johnson said there had been 'too many' homes that didn't follow procedures properly and appeared to blame them for the thousands of residents who have died during the pandemic.Care home bosses branded the claim 'despicable' and 'cowardly', instead pointing blame squarely at the Government, which failed to offer adequate testing and PPE, and discharged hospital patients into homes without testing them.Mr Hancock defended the PM's comments and said his admiration for carers was 'second to none'.He added: 'Throughout this crisis care homes have done amazing work and the Prime Minister was explaining that, because asymptomatic transmission was not known about, the correct procedures were therefore not known.'We've been constantly learning about this virus from the start and improving procedures all the way through, and I pay tribute to the care homes of this country who have done so much to care for the most vulnerable throughout this crisis.'Mr Hancock also refused to rule out asking people who can't wear face masks because of medical conditions, such as asthma, to wear badges explaining this.Masks - or coverings - are still not mandatory in England except on public transport, but are becoming significantly more common in public places in the face of growing evidence they can reduce transmission. It comes after it was revealed yesterday that a historic market town 15 miles south of Leicester was turned into a 'war zone' after it was invaded by hundreds of people from the locked down city desperate for a night out with friends.Leicestershire Police were forced to impose an urgent dispersal order on Market Harborough when alcohol-fuelled disorder erupted on Saturday night.Police had already feared being overrun by out-of-town drinkers when pubs reopened on Saturday after Leicester mayor Sir Peter Soulsby claimed that Leicester pub fans in search of a pint 'could drive to Market Harborough'.

107,The Tories can avoid a Black Wednesday moment in the crisis of Covid-19;Building public trust and balancing health risks with economic growth will be key to recovery,"May 17, 2020 Sunday",International,telegraph.co.uk,753,753,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,By Gerard Lyons and Paul Ormerod,The Tories can avoid a Black Wednesday moment in the crisis of Covid-19Building public trust and balancing health risks with economic growth will be key to recovery,"Is the Covid-19 crisis a Black Wednesday moment for the Government? In September 1992, sterling was forced out of the Exchange Rate Mechanism. The fact that this devaluation was inevitable whoever had won the general election did not matter. The Government took the blame but received little credit for the subsequent economic rebound. As a result, the Conservatives always looked likely to lose the next election, when it came over four years later.This question needs to be asked as the UK - currently with less than 1 per cent of the world's population and 2 per cent of its GDP - accounts for 11 per cent of the deaths from Covid-19.Of course, it is premature to draw lessons from global comparisons. And, as in 1992, the outcome might have been the same whoever was in charge. As the latest data shows, death rates and infections are on a clear downward path. But because of the vaccine gap, the public must behave sensibly. If they do, the worst of this health crisis may be behind us.We are, however, already in the midst of a serious economic crisis. The Government has two exit strategies that it must get right: exit from the lockdown, followed by its exit from a recession that will see UK government debt reaching more than 100 per cent of GDP. Austerity or tax hikes are not the answer. After the Second World War, this ratio was much higher, at around 250 per cent. Now, like then, a pro-growth economic strategy, plus modest inflation and low rates, can bring it back under control.First, the Government must ensure a successful route out of lockdown. Based on our research, which combines the analytical framework of epidemiological models with the behavioural economics of social science, there is much that is reassuring in the Government's approach. It is gradual, being in three phases, allowing monitoring of the virus before progressing to the next stage. It is also sensible to unlock based on economic activity and, despite criticism, to move from a ""stay at home"" to a ""stay alert"" message.Prolonging a rigorous lockdown is neither risk nor cost-free. Recessions destroy lives and well-being. A clear and controlled strategy is needed to ensure that behaviours stay sensible. Individuals, through their actions, and firms, through how they care for their staff and customers, must be alert. Success will be gauged by our ability to keep the virus under control while allowing the economy to recover.In mid-March, the public faced considerable uncertainty and a very limited information set. A new virus was spreading. Death rates in China seemed high and Italian hospitals were overwhelmed. It was rational for people to change behaviour in the face of government encouragement.Voluntary lockdown began in the week of March 16 as traffic fell, offices closed, and restaurants and bar visits declined sharply.We now have a lot more information about Covid-19, though there is still much we do not understand. Those in decent health are not risk-free, but their risk is very low. The vast bulk of deaths are of those with a pre-existing health condition. Yet people have not yet internalised this information. A high level of uncertainty pervades. Thus, behaviour deviates from rationality.This is the Government's biggest challenge. While it wants people to carry out more activities, if behaviour reverts to what it was before the crisis, then a second wave will occur. If behaviours differ, there is no reason to expect a major second wave. Instead, as we are seeing elsewhere, localised outbreaks will be the greatest challenge.The Government has not conveyed the fundamental way in which its strategy is based on ""the science"" - unlocking less risky activities first and minimising harm. Until people have confidence, they cannot reduce the level of uncertainty - ""radical uncertainty"" - which they possess.They cannot act rationally, and their irrationality can be exploited, such as by public sector unions.This will impact on their spending decisions and activities, even as lockdown unfolds. It was Keynes who coined the phrase ""animal spirits"", expressing the fact that the psychological state of companies is integral to ending recessions.This time, and very unusually, it is the psychological state of individuals that will be most key to a recovery. But getting the economy right can help avoid a Black Wednesday moment.

108,What happens to society if we must all wear a mask?;Susie 0rbach mulls how things will change now face coverings are being made mandatory,"June 6, 2020 Saturday",International,The Daily Telegraph (London),1185,1185,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,Susie 0rbachmulls,What happens to society if we must all wear a mask?Susie 0rbach mulls how things will change now face coverings are being made mandatory,"Ihave always been intrigued by young women on the morning commute putting on their make-up. It's not just the steady hand I admire, or the number of products that astound me. It's the matter-offactness of the artifice being exposed. The recognition that this is what you need to do before you get to work. The dual face, the one you awake with and the one you make.I seem to be the only one intrigued. Perhaps it is so commonplace as to become unremarkable. I wonder whether we, in time, will adjust to the Asian custom of wearing masks to protect ourselves and others from illness.For sure, it is odd right now. But on Thursday, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps announced that face coverings will be mandatory on public transport in England from June 15; the Health Secretary later revealed they are bring made compulsory in hospitals, too.Before Covid-19, we liked to see as much of the face as possible. Growing up, I'd be told to take the hair out of my face. We used to ask groups of people to remove their hoodies or burkas and niqabs. They were designated as menacing, as a conscious act of concealing, almost as though they are an assault on the onlooker rather than cultural or religious expression.The full face is how we recognise one another and we aren't yet practised in reading the other just from their eyes. We will learn to focus on eyes certainly as more of us wear masks, but faces haven't been just the sculpted dermis around our eyes, nose, mouth and jaws.Faces interest us so because they reveal something about the inside, too; the experience of living, from ageing, to our activities, to our emotional temperature. If a smile is a carapace for not quite being comfortable with what one feels, that face can reveal what it endeavours to hide.Faces are transparent. We see anger, confusion, hurt flit across the face of a lover or a child. We register when we are being listened to and when our listeners' attention has drifted. We show our disapproval or interest in and to others and they pick that up just as we too pick up their facial expression and interpret it within milliseconds, without either of us being conscious of doing so.So how much more difficult will it be to manage faces concealed behind a protective covering? The masks we are encouraged to wear to prevent the spread of coronavirus have none of the pleasure of concealment of the carnival or fancy dress mask, where our ersatz menace or our sexiness is tantalising. Masks for fun are explicitly designed to invite pleasure and intrigue. They do.In exaggerating the look, whether clown, ghost, prince, Cinderella, Hallowe'en or Disney character, we can be charmed and only a kind of pretend scared. Ritualised masquerades, though, are no preparation for a mask on the Underground or street or at work. The mask today signifies fear and illness and protection.The psychological thing to get one's head around is that we were told initially we are wearing a mask primarily to protect the other person, and that they are wearing their mask to protect us. There are handwritten signs in New York street-level apartment windows saying: ""Wear your mask. Respect the right of others to be protected."" But, when one puts a mask on, it paradoxically seems like an act of self-protection.The physical strangeness and discomfort of doing so feels as though we are putting ourselves in a psychological twist, turning an impulse of disagreeable self-care into a statement of altruism. What's interesting is that the current guidance seems to blur the message by stating how the mask will protect the wearer. In a discussion on their merits for the general public on BBC Radio 4's Inside Science last month, the evidence was shown to be scanty, just like the suggestion for the commonsense evidence for handwashing. We intuitively bought into handwashing.We know the sanitising properties of soap and water and we were schooled in learning about public health initiatives from the 19th century to provide clean water and do away with sewage in the streets.But masks are something different. When we are in the street, we are not being bombarded with the likes of the serious viral load occurring in hospitals and for carers and supermarket workers who all need PPE. Obviously close up, on public transport or in a factory or office, viral load is a considerable factor and so it makes obvious sense and the discomfort lessens. The craving for a personal boundary in a crowded train or bus has long been familiar, and the mask maybe a way of gently protecting us in those environments. It was fascinating that the Government underestimated our capacity for obedience when it ordered the lockdown. Wondering why this was, beyond the hackneyed notions of our exceptionalism and eccentricity, I thought how very far from consideration by behavioural sciences are understandings from psychoanalysis, depth psychology and attachment theory. These theories show how the human psyche is at once complex and extremely simple.When we are excluded, misunderstood, deprived, unhappy, disregarded, insulted, isolated, discriminated against and so on, we develop (both as groups and as individuals) a range of unpleasant behaviours. We can be mean, aggressive, withdrawn, uncooperative, viciously competitive, belligerent. We can be anti-social and ever more so if disregard continues.But, if and when we feel included, when we feel we belong, our attachment system kicks in and expresses altruistic caring behaviours. The lockdown was successful because we were, for a while, in it together. Selflessness and hardship for many were tolerated because people felt valued as individuals able to contribute to the public good. The fractures in society temporarily abated. Psychological and behavioural is both personal and social.Now, in being encouraged to wear a mask, we are asked to do something off-putting and potentially divisive. Will we witness the divide that is sweeping the United States, where the mask can be a symbol of one's politics? Alt-Right folk refuse to ""mask"", while Democrats mask up. Last month, Donald Trump finally wore a mask, under duress, while touring the Ford car plant in Michigan. Pointedly, he removed it before addressing the awaiting media.The psychotherapist is trained to see the masked persona in the consulting room, understanding the necessity of protecting the private selves that we inhabit. As we find a way to adapt to the reality of masks, it will remind us that the world we have created is not one that can be sanitised. Like our personal selves, it is complicated.It is wonderful to experience parks and streets with reduced pollution, to see spring in its especial glory this year, but this sits aside the anguishing knowledge that to really yield respite from the poison we have wrought, we will need to unmask ourselves and not shy away from what needs doing to make a sustainable home planet for all of us.© Susie Orbach 2020.

109,"GHOST TOWN Deserted streets, shuttered shops and police road blocks... Leicester enters first day of local lockdown","July 5, 2020 Sunday",International,The Daily Mail and Mail on Sunday (London),858,858,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,BY NICK CRAVEN,"GHOST TOWN Deserted streets, shuttered shops and police road blocks... Leicester enters first day of local lockdown","AS the rest of England toasted the easing of restrictions, a massive police and public health operation yesterday swung into action in the locked down city of Leicester.Officers in masks patrolled the largely deserted streets, while residents lamented the continuing wait to go to pubs, hair salons and restaurants because of the Covid-19 spike.Concerns that residents would be tempted to slip away to nearby Derby or Nottingham led to checkpoints being set up on the roads. Plain-clothed officers also patrolled the city to ensure social distancing as the UK's first local lockdown officially came into force.In fact, more police were on duty this weekend for Operation Integrate' than were drafted in for the city's New Year's Eve celebrations.Passengers at Leicester railway station were quizzed as the message was driven home that here lockdown would be in place for at least another fortnight.According to some residents, such strict enforcement has been far from the case in parts of Leicester over the past three months.Attention for the surge in cases has focused on up to 1,000 textile factories and overcrowded housing concentrated in North Evington to the east of the city centre. There are certain areas where social distancing hasn't been observed much at all,' said retired railway manager John Chapman, who lives a short distance inside the lockdown zone.The 71-year-old grandfather would have been able to hug his grandchildren or go for a meal or drink yesterday - but has been prevented by the recent surge in cases.Across England, thousands of pubs welcomed back regulars but even those outside Leicester's boundaries are cautious about opening because of people travelling from within the lockdown zone.Vee Cayless, 77, a widow whose garden hedge marks the city-county boundary - and hence the lockdown line - wasn't heading to the pub, but she was pleased to see her grandchildren again.Apart from that, it's not going to make a huge difference to me,' she said. What I'd like to do is get back to my tai chi classes, but that's inside the city and won't be reopening for a while.' Some stores have tried to open early - and been targeted by officials. City council enforcement officers have shut down two non-essential shops in St Saviour's Road in the heart of North Evington, while a further 17 businesses are being reviewed' to see if they have breached guidelines.Dr Charanpreet Johal, director of a community radio station, claimed he raised concerns with police that some businesses were trading in breach of the rules.He told the Leicester Mercury: We have had numerous calls, between 30 and 40 a day, from people who are quite worried about the non-essential businesses which haven't closed down. The people are coming into work at 5am or 6am. We are being called by people worried about coming into work but they are being blackmailed by their bosses.We have had women calling up and crying on the phone, saying they don't know what to do.'Leicestershire Chief Constable Simon Cole said: We have a huge policing presence in that area and people can talk to those officers.'According to figures from July 2, Leicester has an infection rate of 141 per 100,000 - three times higher than the next highest local area.As well as police and Public Health England medical officials, a team of behavioural scientists have been deployed to provide advice if social distancing is not adhered to.The Mayor of Leicester, Sir Peter Soulsby, yesterday claimed that his officials were still not being given sufficient information about infection rates by PHE.A blame game between local and central government has been raging for the past fortnight, with Sir Peter complaining that figures for both positive and negative test results, along with ethnicity and workplace, broken down by postcode, were not coming through.We've asked repeatedly but have just been told we're being given all we need,' he said. But North Evington is a large area and comprises several different communities, and we need to be able to pinpoint where the clusters of infections are if we're to crack this.'A PHE report into the spike revealed it could be partly due to the growth in the availability of testing.However, Professor Paul Hunter, of the University of East Anglia, said increased testing would not be entirely responsible.Sir Peter said that ethnicity was not a compulsory question at testing centres, adding that while North Evington was a predominately black, Asian and minority ethnic area, the breakdown of patients admitted to hospital reflected a roughly 50-50 split of white and BAME.A spokesman for PHE said: From the outset, PHE has regularly and consistently shared all of the data that we hold and that has been made available to us.'Back in the city, the streets surrounding the imposing King Power Stadium were eerily quiet as Leicester City took on Crystal Palace behind closed doors. Indeed, only a few officials in hi-vis jackets gave any indication that a Premier League match was happening.The home side secured a win but, for now at least, fans were unable to join the rest of England and raise a glass in a pub.© Mail On Sunday",Papers
110,Ministers fear top scientists Chris Whitty and Patrick Vallance could resign over two-metre rule relaxation as 'paralysed' Boris Johnson is unfavourably compared to Theresa May over his coronavirus indecision,"June 14, 2020 Sunday",International,MailOnline,1053,1053,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,"David Wilcock, Whitehall Correspondent For Mailonline",Ministers fear top scientists Chris Whitty and Patrick Vallance could resign over two-metre rule relaxation as 'paralysed' Boris Johnson is unfavourably compared to Theresa May over his coronavirus indecision,"•Senior party figures have rounded on the under-pressure Prime Minister•Accuse him of presiding over 'flip-flopping and malaise' at heart of Government•Ex-aide: 'People said Theresa couldn't make a decision - it's like that with Boris'Senior ministers fear the top scientists advising the Government could quit over plans to ease the two-metre rule.Professor Chris Whitty, the popular Chief Medical Officer, and Chief Scientific Adviser Sir Patrick Vallance have made it clear they believe the current guidance on safe distancing should stay.But Boris Johnson will tomorrow pave the way for it to be relaxed amid fears it could spark millions of job losses, with hospitality particularly badly hit.And Chancellor Rishi Sunak said ministers are 'urgently' looking at whether it can be relaxed to boost shops and allow more pubs and restaurants to reopen.He said it would be a decision for ministers rather than scientists as to when the change comes. The Sunday Times claims Downing Street is concerned at the scale of opposition among scientists, who far it could lead to a second spike in coronavirus infections. ""The worry is that Whitty and Vallance could resign,' a source told the newspaper.'It is getting to the stage where they are threatening to minute their opposition to moving from two metres. Those minutes get formally released.'It came as senior Tories have compared Boris Johnson to his predecessor Theresa May, accusing him of being 'paralysed' by uncertainty over coronavirus.Senior party figures including a Cabinet Minister have rounded on the under-pressure Prime Minister, accusing him of presiding over 'flip-flopping and malaise' at the heart of Government. It comes as a new poll by ORB International shows that a majority of voters (52 per cent) thinks the Government is handling the pandemic badly, although that number has fallen.There is also anger after plans to fully reopen primary schools before summer had to be scaled back because there is not enough space in classrooms.                      The Sunday Times today cites three top Tories, a former and ex-Caninet minister and a former No10 aide, as comparing Mr Johnson to his predecessor, who was booted out after floundering for months over Brexit.The aide told the paper: 'Back in the day, people said Theresa was paralysed and couldn't make a decision - it's like that with Boris.'This flip-flopping and malaise comes from the very top. The likes of Rishi and Matt [Hancock, the health secretary] are pulling their hair out.'It came as Mr Sunak said ministers are 'urgently' looking at whether the two metre social distancing rules can be relaxed to boost shops and allow more pubs and restaurants to reopen, Rishi Sunak said today.In a clear sign he would like the rule eased the Chancellor admitted he could see the 'positive impact' of reducing it to 1.5metres or one metre, citing other nations which have already made such a change.It came as the UK's high streets prepare to come back to life from tomorrow, with non-essential retailers allowed to open their doors for the first time since March.The Chancellor told shoppers it was safe to go out and said it was important to save people's jobs. He told Sky's Ridge on Sunday: 'It's the difference between three quarters and maybe a third of pubs opening. So it is importantly that we look at it.'The Sunday Times alleges that Mr Johnson agreed to move faster in restarting the economy after a meeting with the Chancellor, only to row back hours later after a heated discussion with aides.There was also anger over the schools reopening debacle, with a source telling the paper: 'There is zero chance of social distancing in schools. You either accept that or you go and find alternate locations, just as we did with the Nightingale hospitals. There seem to be zero plans for that.'We have a majority of 80, you can hire whoever you want. You can spend any amount of money. You can hire management consultants, specialists, pay Amazon to come in and deliver tests. There are no excuses.'Meanwhile the PM is also facing anger for failing to chair a meeting of the Cobra emergencies committee in more than a month. Critics alleged in the Observer that it has been dropped because its members include the leaders of the UK's devolved administrations, who are at loggerheads with the PM.The insistence of the Government's Scientific Advisory Group on Emergencies (Sage) on maintaining the two-metre rule has caused an intense political backlash, with Tory MPs and the Treasury joining forces to express concern about the economic damage it is wreaking.Figures released last week showed the economy suffered a 20 per cent drop in GDP in April, the largest ever monthly collapse.Chancellor Rishi Sunak told the party's backbench 1922 Committee last week that three-quarters of pubs could open if the distance was cut to one metre, and cited the fact that 24 countries had introduced the flexibility to reduce it.The infection rate in the community has dropped to just 0.06 per cent, while a further 181 people died in the UK in the last 24-hour period to be announced after testing positive for Covid-19.Researchers found that there is a 1.3 per cent chance of contracting the virus when standing two metres away from an infected person; a figure that only increases to 2.6 per cent when separated by one metre.The current 'R' rate is between 0.7 and 0.9: any number below 1 means that the spread of the virus is decreasing.Mr Johnson's new review will take advice from a range of experts, including the Chief Medical Officer Chris Whitty and Chief Scientific Adviser Sir Patrick Vallance - but also behavioural scientists and economists. It will operate in addition to a rolling review of the guidance being carried out by Sage.Prof Whitty has public spoken of the importance of the two-metre rule. He has said social distancing - as well as hand washing, 'good cough etiquette', the use of face coverings - will be in place 'for as long as this epidemic continues'.Sir Patrick Vallance, the chief scientific adviser, has said there was 'relatively little room for manoeuvre' in easing the lockdown measures.A source told the Sunday Times that they were worried the scientists would 'minute' their opposition to any change, meaning it would be published in records of Sage meetings.",Web Publication

Withholding information is patronising and counter-productive Stephen Reicher is a member of the Sage subcommittee advising the government on behavioural science Coronavirus - latest updatesSee all our coronavirus coverage","May 13, 2020 Wednesday",International,The Guardian (London),731,731,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,Stephen Reicher,"Transparency is key in a crisis - so why isn't the British government being straight with us?Contrary to popular belief, people rarely panic in dangerous situations. Withholding information is patronising and counter-productive Stephen Reicher is a member of the Sage subcommittee advising the government on behavioural science Coronavirus - latest updatesSee all our coronavirus coverage","You might assume that during a time of crisis it's important for governments to hold information close to their chest. Surely, in the midst of a life and death struggle, the priority is to be pragmatic and effective. In such circumstances, openness is simply a luxury we can't afford.But openness is not a luxury, or an abstract principle to be set against more pressing needs. In fact, it's a crucial component in the struggle to defeat illness. For a number of reasons, this is rarely appreciated by governments.The most fundamental of these reasons has to do with an elitist conception of human psychology. There is a longstanding view, dating back to the dawn of industrialisation and formation of mass society, that people are psychologically fragile. Their reasoning is beset by bias. They can't comprehend complexity. They can't deal with uncertainty. They certainly can't cope with threat. So in a crisis, they fold. They react            excessively, irrationally, dysfunctionally. And their reactions create as many problems, if not more, than the original crisis itself. This view is encapsulated by a scene common to Hollywood disaster films: people fleeing danger, screaming and waving their arms in the air, before meeting a grisly end.This view holds that since people are childlike and can't look after themselves, they need a paternalistic government to shield them from uncomfortable truths and guide them through a dangerous world. Not surprisingly, this attitude is highly attractive to governments of different stripes. And, over the years, on various committees planning for emergencies, I have seen this attitude again and again. I have endlessly heard the anxious enquiry: ""Won't people panic if we are straight with them?""The irony here is that people very rarely panic in a crisis. They are generally calm, orderly and, as we've seen during the coronavirus crisis, they come together to support each other through hard times. When people die, it is less because they overreact than because they underreact. They fail to appreciate the true dangers of a situation until it is too late. And how can they appreciate those dangers if they            aren't properly warned of them ? Lack of openness, and of clear and comprehensive information, does nothing to protect people. To the contrary - such opacity is a killer during a crisis like this.The real story of this pandemic is one of remarkable public heroism. If the spread of the virus has been contained, it is because people's compliance with the lockdown has gone well beyond expectations. This hasn't been easy. Many people have been suffering, and yet still they have remained home for the public good.What has led to such high levels of adherence? The literature on why people obey authorities is clear. It isn't out of fear of punishment, but because people believe the authorities are of us, and are acting for us. The reason we feel bound together in a common cause has partly to do with a sense of ""procedural justice"": being treated fairly, being listened to and being reasoned with. In other words, people are more inclined to obey authority when they feel they are being respected as equals, not patronised like children.Here, the government's opacity is profoundly corrosive. An unwillingness to trust people with information undermines this sense of procedural justice. In turn, this sets government apart from the people, which weakens adherence to policies such as the lockdown, allowing infection to run rampant. This is why a policy of openness has to be a critical part of the government's efforts to defeat Covid-19.Ultimately, though, we need a broader shift in the relationship between the state and its citizens. The government must abandon a psychology that infantilises people. It must recognise and respect the ability of the public to acknowledge and deal with harsh realities. It must engage us as full partners in every stage of the strategy against Covid-19: from formulating a response, to implementing and evaluating policy. And, as in any constructive relationship, none of this can happen without putting openness at the very heart of what government does.

Participants were asked to flip a coin four times and then tell researchers what it landed on - if it landed on tails they were given a financial reward. In every type of communication people lied, but the more distant the conversation - email compared to video chat, for example - the more likely they were to lie.Women were more likely to be completely dishonest than men if the method of communication was more distant and anonymous, the team discovered.The team say these findings could help companies determine the best methods of communication as people continue to work from home due to coronavirus. Julian Conrads and Sebastian Lotz, from Cologne communicated with volunteers in different ways, from face-to-face to anonymous web-based. 'The research reveals that an individual's lying cost may be affected by social distance concerns,' said Conrads.They met with volunteers over a range of distances and at different levels of anonymity - including fully open face-to-face conversations, web forms filled out in the lab and web forms filled out at home by volunteers.They found the more anonymous and the more distant the communication, the more likely someone was to lie about the result of the coin toss. 'This effect seems to be more pronounced for women than men when it comes to lying to the full extent,' the co-author of the study said.'Women - communicating remotely from home - were more likely to report landing on tails for four times compared to men'. This research is relevant in an organisational setting as decision makers have to decide which communication channel to rely on, the authors said.Lockdown measures, designed to slow the spread of the deadly coronavirus pandemic, has seen millions of people around the world work from home.While some degree of normality is being reintroduced, including shops re-opening and some school children retuning, many office workers are still at home. The team behind the study say their research is particularly useful for firms working out the best way to stay in touch with those distance working employees.For example, how often do they carry out face-to-face Zoom meetings compared to relying on email or even text messages through apps like Teams or Skype.'As face-to-face communication is unavailable due to most employees working remotely, the next best thing is video conferencing rather than chat,' said Conrads.'Dishonest behaviour was prevalent in all experimental treatments but increased as the method of communication became more 'distant' and 'anonymous'.'Basically, they found through their coin flip experiment, that the best way to ensure an employee is being honest is to see their face. The study involved 246 participants - 49 per cent female and 51 per cent male - from a pool of 2,000 students at the University of Duisburg-Essen.They could earn money by privately flipping a coin four times in a row - each time they report tails they'd be given one euro.The volunteers were split into groups - some reported their results with no technology - face-to-face in a lab, some did so over the phone while in the same building and others did so over the internet remotely.Nobody was blameless. They found dishonest behaviour prevalent in all of the different reporting techniques.However, it was more prominent the more remote and anonymous the volunteer became from the researcher asking the questions.

He said there was little room for manoeuvre if the test, track and trace system fails to keep cases down.The latest Office for National Statistics data suggests there are around 54,000 new coronavirus infections per week in England outside hospital and care settings - nearly 8,000 per day.Professor Edmunds questioned whether the test, track and trace system would be able to keep the so-called R value, or reproduction rate, below one unless ""significant numbers of wider social distance measures"" were in place.It comes as a tranche of Sage documents was published online, which revealed:•Evidence of low public compliance with self isolation as only 50 per cent of those who developed symptoms stayed at home for seven days•Test, track and trace was only likely to be effective if 80 per cent of contacts were tracked down and isolated within 48 hours•Experts said public should be advised to wear face coverings on 21 April but advice was not issued by ministers until 11 May•A request was made for pastoral support for Sage members due to the pressures of the work•Ben Warner, a data scientist who worked for Vote Leave, attended meetings on behalf of Downing StreetProfessor Edmunds said: ""I think many of us would prefer to see the incidence driven down to lower levels because that would mean we have fewer cases occurring before we relaxed the measures.""If we had incidence at a lower level, even if the ... level went up a bit, we wouldn't be in a position where we were overwhelming the health service.""I think at the moment with relatively high incidence, relaxing the measures and with an untested track and trace system, I think we are taking some risk here.""Even if that risk doesn't play out and we keep the incidence flat, we're keeping it flat at quite a high level.""​More than 50 documents detailing scientific advice to the government from the beginning of the pandemic until the start of May were published on Friday afternoon.One paper, by a sub-group of behavioural scientists in April, suggested only around half of people with coronavirus symptoms self-isolate for a week. This raised concerns over whether members of the public would self-isolate if they came into contact with an infected person - they would be asked to do so under the test, track and trace system.Advisers said track and trace was likely to be effective if 80 per cent of contacts were tracked down and isolated within 48 hours. They warned that there is a risk individuals become ""less willing to comply"" if they are repeatedly asked to isolate and ""are impacted financially"".The document pointed to ""major behavioural barriers"" to widespread use of the NHS contact tracing app, which is currently being developed, including lack of trust and technological knowledge, particularly among older people.It also warned that Russia would ""scrutinise all western responses to Covid-19 as a significant intelligence gathering opportunity"".Minutes from meetings in May revealed Sage suggested more stringent contact tracing criteria than is being adopted, recommending that people should be told to isolate if they come into contact with someone who has symptoms.The new test, track and trace system recommends people isolate only if they have been in close contact with someone who has tested positive for Covid-19.Experts looked at introducing social ""bubbles"" to allow people to see family and friends in early May but concluded that such a move carried ""potential unforeseen risks"".On mask wearing, the panel concluded on 21 April that ""there is enough evidence to support recommendation of community use of cloth face masks, for short periods in enclosed spaces, where social distancing is not possible"". But ministers did not issue public advice on masks until 11 May.In May, the experts said it was unclear whether children were as likely to spread coronavirus as adults. But some ""variable evidence"" indicated children under 13 were less likely to transmit the virus.The minutes also showed the scientists' hesitancy at advising a lockdown, which was finally imposed on 23 March.Ten days earlier, they wrote: ""Sage was unanimous that measures seeking to completely suppress spread of Covid-19 will cause a second peak.""Sage advises that it is a near certainty that countries such as China, where heavy suppression is under way, will experience a second peak once measures are relaxed.""",Newspaper; Web Publication
114,The Sage advice must be published now to find where Britain got coronavirus wrong;The public deserves to know what happened in the secretive scientific debates that have informed government policy Coronavirus - latest updatesSee all our coronavirus coverage,"May 18, 2020 Monday",International,The Guardian (London),1036,1036,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,Anthony Costello,The Sage advice must be published now to find where Britain got coronavirus wrongThe public deserves to know what happened in the secretive scientific debates that have informed government policy Coronavirus - latest updatesSee all our coronavirus coverage,"A week ago Jeremy Hunt, the chair of the health select committee review of the UK's Covid-19 response, said that some actions represented ""the biggest failure of scientific advice to ministers in our lifetime"".Last Thursday, when pressed by Kirsty Wark on BBC's Newsnight about why the community test, trace and isolate strategy in tackling the pandemic was abandoned as a policy on 12 March,            Jeremy Farrar, the director of the Wellcome Trust and a member of the            Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), was commendably open and honest: ""I do not remember the truth of that [what Sage said] on 12 March ... [but] testing has been critical for every country that has controlled the epidemic ... in retrospect it was [a mistake] ... we should have been testing earlier.""On Saturday, however, when Sir Mark Walport, chief executive of UK Research and Innovation, and another core member of Sage, was asked the same question on Radio 4's Today programme, he responded differently. ""Advice from the scientific community was always to test as much as possible,"" he said. It was a question of logistics - the capacity wasn't there. In other words, Walport saw no failure of scientific advice to government ministers - simply a failure of people in labs and Public Health England to respond to the scientific advice.This is odd because on 15 March he was interviewed on Sky News and made no mention of a testing strategy to reduce transmission: he defended continuation of mass gatherings and the UK's ""world-class"" modelling for the outbreak. Later, when            interviewed           again on 29 March, he said social distancing was the best way to reduce transmission and that testing was needed only for health workers, and for when outbreaks flared up. He also wanted a balance between ""clamping down"" and keeping the economy going. The best advice, he said, was ""coming from the modelling community"".This question about testing policy is far more than a matter of bureaucratic sophistry. The government's decision on 12 March, when the UK had 590 confirmed active cases and nine deaths, led to the uncontained explosion of the Covid-19 epidemic. Imperial College London researchers have estimated the baseline            R value - the rate at which people are passing on infections to others - at that time to have been just below four. Between 12 and 24 March, when the national lockdown started, cases exploded. By 28 March, Imperial researchers estimate that more than 1.8 million people in Britain were infected. The official death toll in the UK from Covid-19 stands at            nearly 35,000 people, though estimates from the Financial Times put the number of lives lost at more than            62,000.Grieving families need to know what advice was given and how it was acted on. I have repeatedly called for a rapid and no-blame audit of Sage advice, to take the pressure off its members, so that we can learn the lessons from the scientific debates that might have led to well-intentioned misjudgments.It's clear that in the early stages of the outbreak, Sage was over-focused on using pandemic influenza as a guideline - a virus with a much lower death rate, a lower R value (around 1.3) and a short incubation period, which makes testing redundant. Its modelling and behavioural subcommittees were labelled with the prefix SPI - scientific pandemic influenza groups. And its rigid contain-delay-research-mitigate strategy comes from the influenza handbook. But this was coronavirus not flu. And it simply didn't listen to advice from the World Health Organization's director-general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, who, when declaring a pandemic on 11 March, said : ""The idea that countries should shift from containment to mitigation is wrong and dangerous.""Understanding these discussions and decisions must come from the accurate, full and public release of the Sage meeting minutes from 28 January up to the present day. And from the evidence of Sage academics who volunteered their time and expertise. This can be done without blame or pointing fingers. Sir Patrick Vallance, the government's chief scientific adviser, said the minutes would be released when the epidemic is over - we are coming towards the end of the coronavirus surge, so that time is now.Sage has been bedevilled by a lack of transparency and balance. If independent public health experts had not been excluded from the core committee, which is dominated by modellers, virologists, clinical academics and behavioural scientists, the influenza-driven ""herd immunity"" strategy might not have materialised. If the blame is now subtly being shifted to public health colleagues by core members of Sage, then this heightens the necessity for full transparency. MPs and the scientific community should press for the unredacted release of meeting minutes immediately.Those minutes have assumed greater importance given the slow and fragmented response by the UK in mounting a sustainable and locally integrated system for finding, testing, tracing and isolating Covid-19 cases. Four months into this epidemic, we are not even close to having a system ready for lifting the lockdown. As an editorial in last week's British Medical Journal declared : ""Meaningless political soundbites promising to recruit 18,000 contact tracers, test 200,000 people a day, or invest in unjustified contact tracing apps, divert focus and could lead to more deaths.""The government has thus far provided the names of 60 contributors to Sage - but its core decision-making group should also be listed. Over the last two months, the British public has complied with social distancing meticulously. It has witnessed, at first hand, the greatest public health disaster in a century, and the deaths of thousands of innocent people, including more than 180 health workers and volunteers, and more than  200 care workers. The public deserves the hard data, scientific opinions and the minutes of Sage meetings - not recollections in the media from senior members - to help us all understand how we got here.

They fear any rule change could come too late for pubs, restaurants and hotels hoping to reopen on July 4. ""One metre is the right decision,"" said Tobias Ellwood, former defence minister. ""Now is the right time, not in two weeks.""Mr Johnson first announced a review of the rule on May 27, when he told Greg Clark, former minister, that the government's scientific advisory body would assess the guidance and publish its results before the scheduled reopening of shops on June 15.Mr Clark secured an urgent question in the Commons to ask why the deadline had been missed and why Britain continued to have one of the world's strictest regimes on social distancing. Edward Argar, health minister, said the new review would be ""comprehensive"" and would include input from economists and behavioural scientists, as well as staunch defenders of twometre distancing such as Patrick Vallance, chief scientific adviser.Iain Duncan Smith, former Tory leader, said it was time for the government to act on ""the most important strategic decision"" related to lifting the lockdown. He echoed the frustration of many Tory MPs. ""I don't believe a single fact will change,"" he said. ""The advisers are divided. The government must make a decision and get this one right.""Fewer scientists are turning up at the daily Downing Street briefings, as tensions rise between the advisers and anxious Tory MPs and ministers, keen to reopen the economy.Dominic Raab, foreign secretary, hosted yesterday's briefing alone in what some saw as a shift of emphasis away from science towards politics. Mr Raab said the scientists' absence was because they had ""a huge amount of work to do"".The hospitality sector is pressing Mr Johnson to provide clarity on when it can reopen and under what terms. Many pubs and restaurants have warned that it would be uneconomic to operate unless the two-metre rule is reduced to either 1.5 metres as in Germany or one metre as in France.Rishi Sunak, chancellor, has been privately urging Tory MPs to make the case to Mr Johnson to swiftly change the rules amid fears that the hospitality sector could be devastated if it cannot operate during the peak summer season. Mr Sunak was among a number of ministers hoping to see the hospitality sector reopen for outdoor customers as early as June 22, but Sir Patrick and Chris Whitty, chief medical officer, strongly opposed the move.Gideon Rachman page 21",Newspaper

Some 86 per cent say investors should increase their allocation to these markets as, despite taking a hit earlier this year, which saw UK small-cap funds fall by more than 35 per cent, they now 'represent excellent value'.Callum Laing, chief executive of MBH Corporation, said: 'The coronavirus has had a more severe impact on the share price and valuations of smaller businesses than larger ones, but there are still many very profitable and well-run small enterprises that now represent excellent value for investors. 'With less coverage from brokers and research houses on these sectors, attractive investment opportunities here will increase.'As was the case across the globe, UK smaller companies bore the brunt of the financial fallout in March compared to their larger counterparts. The FTSE 100 is down 17 per cent from 1 January to 3 July, while the FTSE UK Small Cap is down 24 per cent.However, recovery is on the horizon with the latter having bounced back by 23 per cent since the start of April, ahead of the FTSE 100, which has returned just over 14 per cent during the same period.Francis Gill, director at boutique financial service consultancy Humboldt Financial, said he expects smaller companies to 'boom' in 2021.'Although we anticipate smaller companies will only do okay over the next few months due to uncertainty of business reopenings and the looming question of Brexit. 'However we expect they will boom at the start of 2021 due to less UK investment from Europe, and so more opportunities for smaller businesses to grow and acquire clients and customers that would have been serviced by European companies.'Coupled with the fact that medium and smaller sized companies perform strongly when coming out of a recession too, we have a positive outlook on smaller companies, and they feature in all our equity based model portfolios.'Gill also believes increased redundancies in the short-term will create an opportunity for employees to step back and decide what they want for their work/life balance and consider options away from a nine to five job. He added: 'A smaller, more agile business may give them the opportunity to do that going forward, so the long-term outlook for the sector is great as there is likely to be a rich talent pool entering it over the coming months and years.' Meanwhile, Ken Wotton, manager of Baronsmead VCTs, said smaller companies might be one of the best places to look for income in the current environment.'Savers have traditionally relied on FTSE 100 companies for income, but there are plenty of opportunities in the smaller company space, with more consistent payout policies,' he said.'Instinctively, smaller companies may appear more vulnerable to economic difficulties, but some are dominant in their niche markets, and are relatively insulated from macro dynamics. 'If anything, this misconception provides an attractive entry point into smaller companies, which are trading at a substantial discount to large caps currently.' Despite their more volatile prices, smaller companies are often perceived to provide the best opportunity for returns over the long-term, but investors should always remain cautious.Darius McDermott, managing director of independent fund research company FundCalibre, said: 'Smaller companies can be an excellent investment for investors with a long-term investment horizon and who are willing to take on more risk and the valuations are certainly more compelling right now.'However, this recession is likely to be very deep, and no-one knows how long it will last, so there are bound to be many businesses that struggle and go bust.'That said, there are always winners, and those that do survive could find themselves in much stronger positions going forward.'As always, good stocking picking skills will be paramount, and investors might like to consider smaller monthly contributions rather than a larger lump sum at this stage.'

'Their strength lies in the flexibility of their model that allows movement of stock in either direction, so allowing them capable of coping rapidly with returns, which is vital for the success of the likes of Asos.'The recent pandemic has seen a jump in interest in their services from supermarkets and high street retailers, as they seek to improve the resilience of their supply chains and robustness of their systems.'Clipper could prove to be very much a multi-year success story.'Bioventix - Ken Wotton, Baronsmead Venture Trust'Bioventix is a research company focused on producing antibodies for clinical diagnostics and pharmaceutical research.

117,Terrorism is like a virus: we can only try to mitigate risk,"June 23, 2020 Tuesday",International,The Independent (United Kingdom),578,578,England & Wales,ROBERT VERKAIK,Terrorism is like a virus: we can only try to mitigate risk,"For the past four months we have become used to the idea that the best way to defeat a threat to public health is through a combination of science and collective effort. If we all work together we will win the war against coronavirus. But the horrific stabbings in Reading serve as an abrupt and grim reminder that we can only ever hope to mitigate the risk of random attacks in public places.Like a virus, terrorism can take many different forms but there is no vaccine to protect us against violence triggered by extremist ideology or motiveless attacks brought on by other factors such as mental health issues.Deaths caused by terrorism may be statistically insignificant when compared to the 42,000 people who have already been taken by Covid-19, but each terror attack has a disproportionate impact on the public psyche.From the IRA bombings of the 1970s and 1980s to the attacks on London's transport system in 2005 right up to the current threat posed by Isis, we have had to accept the inherent everyday risk of random attacks against the public from groups rooted in political and extremist ideologies. Indeed, the war on terror looks no closer to being won than it did when it was first declared after the 9/11 attacks on America in 2001.Yet successive governments in the UK have diverted huge resources to funding a raft of counterterrorism measures. The intelligence and security agencies, charged with combating terrorism, have an annual budget of £2.6bn, which has been increasing year on year.Scotland Yard's counterterrorism command, MI5 and GCHQ share a database of 40,000 subjects of interest. Of these, they have prioritised 3,000 who they believe pose the greatest threat. Under MI5's traffic-light system, a further 500 are given the highest priority and are being investigated as part of ongoing counterterrorism operations.There are people who may have, from time to time, expressed extremist views, which in turn have led to referrals to the Prevent programme or the anti-terror hotline. Some referrals may include reports of an individual's support on social media for a caliphate or a state governed by a doctrine of white supremacy.The security services and Prevent teams are inundated with these kinds of referrals, all of which must be investigated. At the same time, police and MI5 officers are already committed to hundreds of counterterror investigations and inquiries. MI5 must try to assess which of the thousands of cases matching the government's fluid definition of extremism deserve resources.Given this morass of data and investigation, it is no wonder that individuals, like the London Bridge and Westminster Bridge attackers, who appeared in the peripheral vision of the security services, still manage to slip through the net.For years the security services have been employing teams of behavioural scientists to help them understand the terrorist mind so they can make the right decisions. Now the government has recruited spooks to help tackle Covid-19. Last month the government established a Joint Biosecurity Centre, responsible for setting coronavirus threat levels. Until last week it was led by Tom Hurd, the director-general of the Office for Security and Counter-Terrorism who has been tipped to be the new head of MI6.It seems in the world of public risk mitigation, the line between science and surveillance is becoming more and more blurred. But what remains constant is the need for vigilance and collective action.",Newspaper
118,"Do face coverings reduce risk and spread of coronavirus?;As England announces compulsory face coverings on public transport, what is scientific evidence behind measure?Coronavirus - latest updatesSee all our coronavirus coverage","June 4, 2020 Thursday",International,The Guardian (London),674,674,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,Hannah Devlin Science correspondent,"Do face coverings reduce risk and spread of coronavirus?As England announces compulsory face coverings on public transport, what is scientific evidence behind measure?Coronavirus - latest updatesSee all our coronavirus coverage","                   Do face coverings reduce the spread of Covid-19?                   Surgical-grade face coverings and respirators offer high levels of protection against coronavirus infection for the wearer. However, these robust masks have to be combined with goggles or a visor, and they are costly, in limited supply, and uncomfortable to wear for long periods. The evidence around homemade masks or face coverings, which the           public in England will now be required to wear on public transport, is less clear cut.Studies in laboratories have shown that they can reduce the distance and number of droplets spread by coughs, but the impact of masks in ""field conditions"" has been harder to assess. The ambiguity around the science probably explains the different approaches different countries have taken - and the evolving rules around wearing face masks.                                        Was advice to wear face masks previously considered in the UK?                                      Yes. As early as 3 February one of the key bodies advising the government on its approach to tackling the pandemic, the New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group (Nervtag) concluded there was some evidence to support the wearing of masks by those with symptoms to prevent transmission. The group recommended to the Department of Health and Social Care that symptomatic people should wear fluid-resistant masks ""if tolerated"".This never became a recommendation to the general public. The same group said there was limited evidence of the benefits of the general public wearing face masks as a preventative measure.Separately, in April, behavioural scientists sitting on the government's Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) considered the pros and cons of recommending face masks. The group highlighted the risk that wearing masks could make people feel invincible and therefore be less likely to adhere to other rules around socialising and staying at home. At the time, some also had concerns that recommending the wider use of face masks could exacerbate the acute shortages of PPE among healthcare workers that the UK was grappling with earlier in the pandemic.                   Has the science on face masks changed?                   Previously, the government has defended its decision not to recommend the use of face masks - while other countries have urged people to adopt masks - saying: ""For the majority of people in more general settings, there is little evidence of widespread benefit of using face masks to prevent transmission.""In Thursday's announcement, Grant Shapps, the transport secretary, said: ""The evidence suggests that face coverings offer some, albeit limited, protection against the virus.""So has the science changed? Although there have been concerted efforts to answer the question of whether face masks make a difference, there has not been a dramatic shift in the science: there is some evidence of a benefit, but it remains fairly weak.This week, the Lancet published the most comprehensive paper to date on the subject, a systematic review of 172 studies looking at the role of physical distancing measures, face masks, and eye protection to prevent transmission. It found weak support for the use of face coverings, with the risk of infection or transmission when wearing a mask being estimated at 3% versus 17% when not wearing a mask. Evidence in the study was looking mainly at mask use within households, rather than on public transport, and the authors note that the certainty of the evidence is low and other measures, such as physical distancing, are by far the most effective at reducing the spread of coronavirus.The science is still uncertain, but as the most robust infection control measures are lifted, the more marginal gains that may be achieved through the use of face coverings may have simply become more relevant. This article was amended on 5 June 2020 to clarify that the requirement to wear face masks on public transport applies in England, not the UK.",Newspaper

Boris Johnson has launched a 'comprehensive review' of the strict regulation, which critics say is crippling businesses and making it harder for schools to reopen.The rule will be reconsidered by a panel of economists and scientists, with a decision set to come before the expected reopening of pubs and restaurants from July 4.The Government's advice to stay 2m apart is further than the World Health Organisation's recommendation of at least 1m, and some other countries like France and Denmark.Mr Sunak confirmed yesterday the Government would 'take a fresh look' at the regulation and suggested the decision was for ministers, not scientists, to take.He told Sky News: 'The Prime Minister has put in place a comprehensive review of the two-metre rule. That review will involve the scientists, economists and others so that we can look at it in the round.'I know that of course it's the difference between three-quarters and maybe a third of pubs opening, for example, so it's important that we look at it.'The Chancellor said any decision on ending the lockdown before a vaccine was ready had an element of 'risk', but pointed out that other countries have lower distance requirements and were still managing to contain the virus. 'Now that we have made good progress in suppressing the virus, we're at a different stage of this epidemic than we were at the beginning and that enables us to take a fresh look at this,' he said. 'I can very much understand the impact, the positive impact it will have on business's ability to reopen and thereby maintain the jobs that they have.'The new distancing review will take advice from experts including the chief medical officer Chris Whitty and chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance. The panel will also include behavioural scientists and economists.Mr Sunak also suggested that the Government would be prepared to override the views of Sir Patrick and Professor Whitty if they did not agree with a reduction.He told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show that scientists had made clear there is a 'different degree of risk at different levels', and the decision on relaxing the rule was 'ultimately' for ministers to make.He said: 'Much as I would like to see it reduced - everyone would like to see that reduced from an economic perspective - we can only do that if it's safe and responsible to do so.'Former Tory leader Sir Iain Duncan Smith said: 'If other countries are doing it successfully, we need to move now.'Shadow justice secretary David Lammy said Labour would support a relaxation of the 2m rule if the evidence showed it was 'the right time to do it'.Latest coronavirus video news, views and expert advice at mailplus.co.uk/coronavirus",Web Publication

Katherine Pires, a 50-year-old East Hartford native, was arrested on Sunday and charged with hindering prosecution and lying to police. She was arraigned in the Superior Court in Hartford and has a bail set at $25,000, the Hartford Courant reports. Little information was released about the allegations against Pires - who has her next court appearance scheduled for July 14 - but investigators have said that she has been interviewed over the years, with her statements proving to be inconsistent. 'Katherine has nothing to do with the crimes she is accused of and nothing to do with the murder of Ms. Ziemlewski in 1998,' said Aaron Jainchill, a lawyer for Pires.'Katherine has not been charged with murder nor conspiracy to commit murder and has never been accused of either crime by law enforcement.' Ziemlewski was shot three times in the neck at close range while walking on a trail in 1998. Police have long maintained that the woman knew her killer but no one has been charged in connection to Ziemlewski's death.Ziemlewski was shot approximately 100ft from the gate at Old Mountain Road in Farmington. Farmington Lt. Tim McKenzie has stressed that the department has never stopped working on the case. The department recently worked with the FBI Behavioral Analysis Unit to review the case. 'Tremendous progress' has since been made on the case, police said. 'The Farmington Police Department will continue to utilize all available resources and continue working with its community partners,' McKenzie said. 'The Farmington Police Department will not rest until justice is achieved and closure is obtained for Agnes' family.'Ziemlewski lived in West Hartford, where she had been working at United Health at the time of her killing. A Polish immigrant, she graduated from Bulkeley High School in 1989 and from the University of Connecticut in 1994. Two years ago, police said that the woman had gone to the Stop and Shop in West Hartford before going to the reservoir on the day of her death. Ziemlewski was described as being athletic by friends, who said that she practiced martial arts and would ski and Rollerblade in her spade time. Investigators also learned that she enjoyed going for runs in the reservoir. While on the trail, two joggers heard gunshots at around 5.24 on the day and went to the road to flag down help. The woman's body was found not far from Red Reservoir Road. There were no witnesses at the time of the woman's killing but authorities did search several cars that were near the scene. Approximately 300 people were interviewed in connection to the killing. There is a $50,000 reward for information that leads to the woman's killer. ",Web Publication
123,Learn how to become a poker pro in a year;Dominic Maxwell discovers how to use his noggin and nerve to change his luck,"June 27, 2020 Saturday",International,The Times (London),855,855,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,,Learn how to become a poker pro in a yearDominic Maxwell discovers how to use his noggin and nerve to change his luck,"Early on in this beguiling book about going from poker novice to poker pro in a year or so, the Russian-American writer and psychologist Maria Konnikova makes a smart observation about luck. ""When chance is on our side,"" she writes, ""we disregard it: it is invisible. But when it breaks against us, we wake to its power. We begin to reason about its whys and hows.""And chance had broken against Konnikova, or at least that's how it felt to her. Her mother and husband had lost their jobs. Her grandmother had died. Konnikova had developed ""a bizarre autoimmune condition"" that made her allergic to almost everything. What was going on? How could she seize control of her life? Perhaps it's a perverse response to go from all these personal setbacks to becoming a professional practitioner of Texas hold 'em. Over the next 300-plus pages, however, Konnikova does a good job of convincing us that her story is about more than money or power or confidence or luck, although it touches on all of these things. Her first two books were a look at confidence men and a guide to thinking like Sherlock Holmes. This is like a merging of the two: how to use your noggin and nerve to out-con the conmen.Konnikova soon gets drawn into the idea that poker is no mere game of chance. ""From managing emotion to reading other people, to cutting your losses and maximising your gains, to psyching yourself up into the best version of yourself so that you can not only catch the bluffs of others but bluff successfully yourself, poker is endlessly applicable and revelatory."" Her biggest slice of luck, however, is getting the veteran poker great Erik Seidel to become the Yoda to her Luke Skywalker. His sense of curiosity is as appealing as his sense of calm. ""The basic math [of poker] is so basic that a six-yearold could do it,"" he tells her, suggesting that ""good thinking"" and ""hard work"" could take her to the top. Or somewhere vaguely near it.One part quest to one part behavioural science book, The Biggest Bluff is accessible even to non poker players. The science bits sometimes weigh a little heavy on the narrative, but it nonetheless follows in the noble tradition of journalists taking time off from the day job to learn a new trade, with one eye on personal growth and another on the book or articles they can get out of it. Still, Konnikova is always upfront about that. The Biggest Bluff is subtitled ""How I learned to pay attention, master myself and win"", so you know she will eventually earn some dollars, and you know she will find out some things about herself.And she draws vividly the characters she meets: Seidel, in particular, but also the various coaches and players who help or hinder her along the way. The poker pro who installed a slide between the two floors of his Manhattan duplex. The old Russian gent who isn't such a gent after all. The sudden appearance of the film star and comedian Kevin Hart, betting a poker pro he can't do 105 press-ups in less than 22 minutes during a big-money game in Monaco.Before any glamorous face-offs, however, Seidel insists Konnikova plays online only while she builds her confidence.Gambling is illegal in New York, so she has to take her laptop to a coffee shop in New Jersey each day and play there. Even online, poker is a game of strategy more than chance. The best cards win the hand only 12 per cent of the time, she explains. So Seidel tells her not to worry when she loses to good hands; that happens to everyone.Worry instead if she loses because she handles herself wrongly.And as she starts going to actual tournaments, first for small stakes, eventually to bigger tables in Las Vegas and Monaco and Macau, she does a good job of making us understand how hard it is to stay rational in such environments. And it can be even harder as a woman, learning how to respond to being patronised or propositioned, learning to steer a course between the twin rocks of passivity and undue aggression.Is it all about reading other players' faces? No, that's little use apparently; you are better off looking at their hands. Some of the book's greatest pleasures are little discoveries like that, moments when you get to feel like quite the insider. She explains the difference between ""fish"" (bad players with money to lose) and ""whales"" (bad players with lots of money to lose) and the ""sharks"" who eat them up. How do players stay alert for so long? Sometimes with caffeine pills, sometimes thanks to nutritionally perfect meals prepared for them by the chefs they take on tour with them. Anything to give them that scintilla of edge.Konnikova is a good writer and hellishly bright, but she's not a lean, mean storytelling machine like Malcolm Gladwell. If The Biggest Bluff sprawls a bit, though, it also takes you on a rewarding journey into a new world. It won't tell you the secret of how to win at poker any more than it will tell you how to win at life, but it might give you a few ideas.The Biggest Bluff How I Learned to Pay Attention, Master Myself, and Win by Maria Konnikova 4th Estate, 354pp; £20Is it all about reading other players' faces?

'There's a volcano, that unless Boris wakes up to it now, will go bang': Restauranteur Richard Caring warns PM's 'indecision' on reopening restaurants, pubs and cafes could cost two million workers their jobs                   One of Britain's most powerful business tycoons has launched a blistering attack on the Government, warning that Boris Johnson's 'weakness and indecision' on reopening restaurants, pubs and cafes will cost more than two million workers their jobs. In a rare interview, restaurateur and private members' club mogul Richard Caring - whose empire includes the famous Annabel's club, Scott's in London and The Ivy restaurant chain - warned the Prime Minister he was 'killing the country' by failing to outline when hospitality venues could reopen and whether they would have to abide by the two-metre social distancing rule. Caring, whose staff have now delivered a million and one freshly cooked free meals to NHS workers and vulnerable people in lockdown, said Ministers had grossly underestimated the permanent damage being done to Britain's 26,000 restaurants. He told The Mail on Sunday that thousands of businesses and their employees were in the 'eye of a storm' - surviving thanks only to the Government's taxpayer-funded furlough scheme that pays staff wages, and a pause on rent and business rates tax bills. As soon as state aid measures are withdrawn, Caring warned, as many as '50 per cent or 60 per cent' of the four-million-strong hospitality workforce could be laid off and restaurants, cafes and bars shuttered for good. He said the wave of redundancies would be 'like a volcano' erupting, with the worst of the pain coming in September and October when the furlough scheme ends. The intervention by arguably the most influential businessman in the hospitality industry will pile pressure on the Prime Minister to ease two-metre social distancing rules and follow countries such as France, Spain, Italy and Germany in allowing restaurants and pubs to reopen with less onerous restrictions.Calling for urgent action to avert the looming jobs crisis, Caring said: 'The beginning of the lockdown gave us an initial shock. Now it's quite calm because people are furloughed, businesses are not paying staff, they are not paying rent, they are not paying rates and staff don't have the expense of going to work and the expense of going out. 'So as a restaurateur, you believe you can sit tight and survive, and that's what everyone's doing. But the big problem that people shy away from is that we're in the eye of a storm. 'The fact is, down the road there's a volcano that is going to bubble over. I don't think people can see it yet, but everyone in hospitality is beginning to realise they will have to make heavy cuts. 'This volcano, unless we wake up to it now, it's going to be horrendous. It's just going to explode, spewing out unemployed people. The pain and suffering it is going to cause is horrific. 'There are estimates saying we could have up to five million unemployed. It's not going to be five million - it's going to be more. I don't think we've seen anything yet. The Government is killing the country right now and the hospitality industry is the frontline disaster.' Caring, a Tory donor, rarely makes public statements, so his intervention is likely to be received in Westminster as a piercing blow to the Government. The tycoon - who is known as the 'king of clubs' for his array of prized assets which also include Harry's Bar and Mark's Club, the J Sheekey, Sexy Fish and Le Caprice restaurants in London, as well as the Bill's chain and a major stake in the Soho House clubs network - paid £150,000 last year at a Tory Party fundraising event to dine with Mr Johnson at the Mark's Club in Mayfair. Talking to The Mail on Sunday alongside his right-hand man Alexander Spencer-Churchill, the grandson of the 10th Duke of Marlborough, Caring urged the Prime Minister to be 'brave' and 'stand up and be counted'. Mr Johnson has launched a review of the two-metre rule and indicated that hospitality businesses might be allowed to reopen on July 4. But he has given no concrete assurances and speculation is rife that the PM wants to keep social distancing at two metres until September, when schoolchildren are scheduled to return to classrooms. 'The British people are tough, but they want to have something to hold on to, and we're not giving them anything at the moment, just ""maybes"",' Caring said. 'They deserve more.' He believes the Government has failed to grasp the scale of the looming unemployment crisis. Alongside the two million hospitality layoffs, Caring estimates that 25 per cent of those on furlough in other industries will eventually lose their jobs. He predicts that the cull will push the overall jobless figure for Britain to an astonishing seven million people - equal to about one in five of the working-age population. 'The clock is ticking and when furlough ends, that will be it for a lot of businesses,' he said. 'Businesses that were not strong in December 2019 will not survive. I think the country is going to wake up to this terrible shock.' In Europe, Germany, Belgium, Greece, Italy, the Netherlands and Portugal have all allowed restaurants to open with 1.5 metres social distancing. Meanwhile, France, Austria, Denmark, Norway, China, Hong Kong, Lithuania and Singapore require only one metre. Guidelines issued by the World Health Organisation also recommend keeping a distance of one metre.Caring said: 'If they can do it elsewhere, why not here? 'I get so many calls from people saying when are you going to open the restaurants. 'My answer is I can't - there are no regulations, there are no rules, there is no information. We don't know if we need glass screens between tables. Is it two metres without screens? One and a half with screens? We don't know. We're just told it's under review, under review, under review.' Caring said 'the world has turned on its head five times' since Britain went into lockdown in March to deal with the Covid-19 crisis. He has spent it at his home in London with wife Patricia and their three children, aged one, three and five. 'I'm just so very upset for everyone in this country and I just want everyone to be OK. 'This crisis has changed my way of thinking dramatically. This has been such as tremendous shock to everybody.' In January, Caring completed a deal with the former prime minister of Qatar that brought in additional investment for his hospitality empire. 'We as a company were in expansion mode right up until the announcement of Covid back in February,' Caring revealed. 'Now that whole landscape has changed totally and our focus has become being secure and protective.' He added: 'We hadn't signed any contracts because we were waiting for clarity on Brexit, so we didn't actually complete any of the expansion. And then Covid hit - so our hesitation really proved to be fortunate.' 'I have definitely at this time lost some of the aggression to expand. Now it's about survival. We are anxious to reach a place of calm.' Caring started out in clothing and made his name importing fashion lines from the Far East to high street giants such as Next and many other retailers, before moving into the restaurant and private members' club business with the purchase of Caprice Holdings group for £31.5million in 2005. The flamboyant mogul has donated generously to help the pandemic relief effort. Together with his wife, he set up The Caring Foundation earlier this year to feed NHS workers, critically vulnerable communities, hungry children, the unemployed and the isolated elderly across the UK and Ireland during the pandemic. More than 1,000 of Caring's staff volunteered to cook meals in 26 kitchens at Annabel's, The Ivy Collection, Caprice and Bill's restaurants in cities and towns including Manchester, Birmingham, Glasgow, Dublin, Cardiff, Brighton and London. To help with storage and distribution in the capital, The Caring Foundation partnered with The Felix Project, a charity which fights food waste and hunger. On the menu has been The Ivy's shepherd's pie, Harry's lasagne, Sexy Fish chilli and other favourites from Caring's restaurants. At 3pm last Thursday, Caring's volunteers handed out meal number one million and one. 'The Caring Foundation meals were very much my wife Patricia's idea,' Caring said. 'She came to me one day three months ago and said there's a situation where the Foundation can help as concern for people's wellbeing unfolded on the news. 'The Caring Foundation cannot thank all of the staff involved enough for their kindness and generosity of time.' Members of Caring's private clubs, including Annabel's, donated £2million towards the cost of the scheme and a JustGiving fundraising page was set up where members of the public donated sums from as little as £5. 'Many of those additional donations were sent with the kindest of supporting messages,' he said. Caring himself is guaranteeing the final bill. He said the volunteers are now having a two-week rest to give staff a 'bit of a break' after reaching a million and one meals and assess whether the scheme is still useful as lockdown is eased. 'My own feeling is that there will be a lot more needed going forward,' Caring said. Spencer-Churchill, who helped with the volunteering effort, said: 'We are so grateful for our members' incredible generosity in helping health workers and those desperately in need. Our staff say the freshly cooked, nutritious food has gone down very well.' The Caring Foundation has also partnered with Bem Querer Mulher (BQM), a UN-backed charity programme in Brazil that fights domestic violence against women and children. Figures show domestic violence cases across the world have risen with families isolated for long periods during lockdown, and the Caring-BQM partnership, which has been set up by Patricia, will open a new Well Woman Centre in San Paolo offering support to women and children who are victims of abuse. A similar centre is planned for London. Despite his best efforts, Caring said his business empire won't escape the job cuts forecast for later this year. He warned that 'value' restaurant chains such as Bill's were most at risk of the industry-wide layoffs. Familiar high street names such as Cafe Rouge and Frankie & Benny's have already announced swathes of closures and job cuts. 'I'm really upset about losing staff because we have a lot of very good people,' Caring said. 'But we have to look at staying in business. 'I'm of no use to our staff if we go out of business, so we have to make cuts. 'I like to think that this will turn itself around to the point where we can bring those people back very soon.' Caring said nearly all the landlords of his restaurants had been 'supportive' during the lockdown, adding: 'I strongly recommend that landlords and tenants communicate - they are hand-in-hand in this situation and only by the willingness to be aware of each other's problems can they make positive progress. They need each other now more than ever before.' He said the widely reported investment deal in January with Hamad bin Jassim bin Jaber Al Thani - who also owns Claridge's, The Connaught, The Shard sky scraper and Paris Saint-Germain football club - 'put us on the international stage'. 'The idea was we would have partners with worldwide experience and knowledge we could tap into for our benefit. They are extremely impressive and solid people and we have learned an awful lot from them in our short experience. '[But now] I'm not looking at fast expansion. This crisis has been a real eye-opener for me and I'm sure the rest of the world. 'I would definitely settle for a quieter life in future.' Spencer-Churchill added: 'Our members have being amazing from all clubs and what touches me the most is they have asked about the welfare of the staff - we really have the best members. 'Without our team we would not have the clubs we have.' In a final plea to the Prime Minister, Caring said so far the Government had been 'extremely forthcoming' in supporting the economy. But he said Ministers now 'must really stand up and be counted' and 'stop being evasive'. He argued that Britain should 'carry on urgently printing money' to prop up businesses starved of income to pay their bills. Figures on Friday showed the UK economy shrank by 20.4 per cent in April and a cross-party group of MPs warned that three-quarters of pubs, restaurants, hotels and travel businesses would not be able to operate if they had to reopen under two-metre social distancing. Caring said: 'The Government has either got to say we're going to have 15, 20, 25 per cent of the population unemployed and we'd rather pay that bill, or they've got to get involved and start making some decisions, because this is not a problem that's going to go away. 'The only difference between this and the Great Depression of the 1930s is that today our banks are better capitalised, our Government is more aware and money is cheap for the foreseeable future. 'If I was Prime Minister, I would print a lot more money because this devastation is going to last a long time. What are they waiting for? 'Someone has got to stand up and be counted. Answer questions, have a plan. 'I believe in this country and the courage of the British people. We went through the Blitz and this is the Blitz again, times ten. We could do with a Winston Churchill, but we will come out of it. 'But the economy is going to be so damaged and the unemployment rates so high that it's going to take many years. We're destroying the economy as we go. 'My message to the Government would be make some decisions, give us something to hold on to and take advantage of the low interest rates that are definitely here for the foreseeable future. 'Because the pain of 20 to 25 per cent unemployment and the suffering and the hardship that will cause will be three times worse than this virus.'",Web Publication
126,Deputy chief medical officer warns of 'very dangerous moment' facing UK as scientists fear lockdown eased too soon;Experts advising the government voice fears that virus is spreading too fast to lift restrictions,"May 30, 2020 Saturday",International,The Independent (United Kingdom),920,920,England & Wales,Lizzy Buchan,Deputy chief medical officer warns of 'very dangerous moment' facing UK as scientists fear lockdown eased too soonExperts advising the government voice fears that virus is spreading too fast to lift restrictions,"The country is facing a ""very dangerous moment"", the deputy chief medical officer has said as a growing number of scientific advisers spoke out over fears lockdown was being lifted too quickly.Professor Jonathan Van-Tam, using extraordinary language, urged the public not to ""tear the pants out of"" the new freedoms as people flocked to beaches and beauty spots over the weekend to enjoy the sunshine.Top scientists advising the government expressed growing alarm at the lifting of restrictions when 8,000 new cases were occurring per day and the new test and trace system was still in its early stages.Professor Robert West, a member of the behavioural scientists' subgroup that advises the government, said there was a ""huge risk"" of a spike in coronavirus infection rates and accused ministers of ""not taking responsibilities for political leadership seriously"".Another member of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), Professor Peter Horby, warned: ""Returning to a situation where we have lost control again is far worse than another week or two of social measures.""But ministers are determined to press ahead with loosening of restrictions, with plans to bring back competitive sport from Monday and new freedoms to socialise and exercise outside in groups of up to six people.The warnings from the scientific community come as:•The deputy chief medical officer took a swipe at Dominic Cummings, saying the rules ""apply to all""•Coronavirus deaths rose to 38,376 people, an increase of 215 deaths on the previous day.•The president of the Association of Directors of Social Services said the government's £600m infection control fund for care homes was ""confused and unnecessarily bureaucratic""•Senior Tories called on the government to review the two-metre social distancing rules to prevent the collapse of the hospitality sector•A former cabinet minister said voters will become disenfranchised unless arrangements for a virtual parliament remain in placeAmid widespread reports that members of the public were defying the restrictions, several members of Sage took the unusual step of publicly warning ministers they were moving too fast on lifting the lockdown.Prof West said the number of daily cases was still relatively high, adding: ""Put all this together and you have a huge risk, and it's not just me saying that, that there will be an increase in infection rates.""Because we don't have track and trace in place, we won't know whether this easing of the lockdown has caused an increase in infections for some time, by which time it will be well under way, the second peak will be well under way.""The government is not taking its responsibilities for political leadership seriously.""Prof Horby, of Oxford University, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme there were still 8,000 cases per day and there was ""very little headroom"" if the infection rates rose again.Asked if there was a risk of a second spike, he said: ""That's the risk we are all very concerned about. It is a fragile time, we have to be very careful.""He added: ""Returning to a situation where we have lost control again is far worse than another week or two of social measures.""Their interventions came after Professor John Edmunds, another member of Sage, warned that Boris Johnson's decision to allow the public greater freedom was ""risky"".He also raised concerns about the new test and trace system launched on Thursday to track people infected by coronavirus, saying: ""We can't be sure that is working effectively yet, and yet we're going ahead and making these changes anyway.""These concerns were echoed by Sir Jeremy Farrar, the respected director of the Wellcome Trust, who also attends Sage meetings.He said: ""Covid-19 is spreading too fast to lift lockdown in England. Agree with John and clear science advice.""TTI [test and trace] has to be in place, fully working, capable [of] dealing [with] any surge immediately, locally responsive, rapid results and infection rates have to be lower. And trusted.""Prof Van-Tam said at the daily Downing Street press conference that the government and the public had a ""dual responsibility"" to prevent a second wave of the virus, adding: ""I believe this is also a very dangerous moment. We have to get this right.""He said scientific opinions ""always vary to some extent"", and told the press conference that the lockdown easing must go ""painstakingly"" slowly.He added: ""There is a dual responsibility here of government to go slowly and carefully and to take the advice from the scientists.""Of the scientists, to watch this whole thing very closely over the next few weeks.""And, of the public in general to actually follow the guidance. Don't tear the pants out of it, and don't go further than the guidance actually says.""Prof Van-Tam was also pressed on whether those in authority should set an example to the public on obeying the restrictions, amid an ongoing row over whether Dominic Cummings breached the rules by travelling 260 miles to his parents' farm in County Durham.The senior medic made his feelings clear, saying: ""In my opinion the rules are clear and they have always been clear.""In my opinion they are for the benefit of all. In my opinion they apply to all.""On the concerns, a No 10 spokesperson said: ""As the PM said on Thursday when this next step was unveiled, we have at all times been informed by the data and evidence, and this package of measures has been carefully designed so that we can ease the burdens of lockdown while expecting to keep that R below one.""",Newspaper; Web Publication

Sign up now!,"June 29, 2020 Monday",International,The Guardian (London),1283,1283,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,Barry Glendenning,Duking it out behind the closed doors of the Enormo-Dome that is WembleySign up now! Sign up now! Sign up now? Sign up now!,"                   CUP TRAGIC                   With four teams who have won the past six FA Cup finals between them ready to duke it out behind the closed doors of the cavernous 90,000-seat Enormo-Dome that is Wembley Stadium in this year's semi-finals, you could be forgiven for thinking the FA Cup has perhaps lost just a teensy-weensy bit more of its lustre. In previous years, the reluctance of assorted top-flight and Championship sides to take the competition seriously resulted in reduced crowds at Cup ties. With the elimination of Norwich, Sheffield United, Newcastle and Leicester at the weekend, the only thing faintly resembling magic left in this year's FA Cup is the manner in which all the fans have disappeared.When the main talking point to emerge from four quarter-finals is the wanton extravagance and callous disregard for the environment demonstrated by Arsenal's Kieran Tierney, spending 10p on a plastic bag from Tesco in which to carry his Lynx Java shower gel, BO spray and aftershave, you know you've been sold several footballing pups. Of course what has gone largely unnoticed in the stampede to praise Tierney for his Sunday league man-of-the-people credentials, is that Tesco ""wear"" the same kit as Sheffield United's hated rivals, Wednesday. Tierney was quite clearly engaged in a spot of top-class trolling when he rocked up at Bramall Lane. You mark the Fiver's words, the next time Arsenal play at Villa Park he'll be carrying his smellies in the old gold of Wolves and Sainsbury's.While the Fiver is prepared to die on the hill that an FA Cup final and semi-finals played behind closed doors are no FA Cup final and semi-finals at all, we're somewhat perplexed that no apparent effort is being made to at least try to jazz them up... not least because they'll be contested by the usual suspects, for whom playing at Wembley is not a particularly big deal. While there's probably some contractual small print the Fiver hasn't read forbidding such a move, the notion of inviting cash-strapped League One and Two clubs to volunteer to stage the semi-finals, then drawing two out of the FA tombola is not particularly ""out there"".The obvious argument that they would be unable to cater for the tournament's VAR needs is rendered moot when you consider that plenty of FA Cup matches have already been contested in lower league grounds this season without technology and somehow we've coped. Add in the fact that the FA has just announced 124 positions will be made redundant on the back of £300m in Covid-19 related losses, and the needless extravagance of opening Wembley for the three remaining games looks even more ill-advised. The Fiver's heart goes out to all of those at FA HQ - and indeed anywhere else - who have lost their jobs during this difficult time.

128,How a decade of privatisation and cuts exposed England to coronavirus;Government reliance on private contractors follows dramatic changes to local councils and public servicesCoronavirus - latest updatesSee all our coronavirus coverage,"May 31, 2020 Sunday",International,The Guardian (London),4701,4701,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,"Felicity Lawrence, Juliette Garside, David Pegg, David Conn, Severin Carrell and Harry Davies",How a decade of privatisation and cuts exposed England to coronavirusGovernment reliance on private contractors follows dramatic changes to local councils and public servicesCoronavirus - latest updatesSee all our coronavirus coverage,"Every Thursday at 8pm, millions of Britons have opened their front doors or stood on balconies to applaud the NHS. The ritual has been a weekly expression of gratitude to medical workers, and national pride in a state-run health service said to be the envy of the world.""Let's not forget,"" Boris Johnson said in early March, near the start of the coronavirus crisis, ""we already have a fantastic NHS, fantastic testing systems and fantastic surveillance of the spread of disease.""Yet those who have experienced the government's emerging testing and tracing operations for Covid-19 have had limited contact with the NHS. Instead, Britons with symptoms are directed to a network of 50 drive-through testing centres, set up by management consultants at Deloitte.Upon arrival, patients are marshalled not by NHS staff, but workers in hi-vis jackets supplied by outsourcing companies, such as Serco, G4S, Mitie and Sodexo. Those who cannot make the drive have received postal test kits, processed by the private diagnostics company Randox and delivered by Amazon.When contact tracing to stop the spread of the virus finally moved up the agenda in late April, the health and social care secretary, Matt Hancock, said the job would be done with an as-yet unproven NHS app. The app has been developed by private firms for NHSX, the technology wing of the health service, which is also responsible for a Covid-19 government data operation involving tech companies Palantir, Faculty, Amazon, Google and Microsoft.On Thursday the government finally launched its long-awaited NHS Test and Trace Service. But despite the name, many of the 25,000 contact tracers tracking those potentially exposed to Covid-19 and advising them to self-isolate will be working not for the NHS, but rather the outsourcing firms Serco and Sitel.The government's reliance on private contractors during the public health emergency comes after a decade of public sector reorganisation, marketisation and deep cuts to services and local government in England. The Guardian has interviewed dozens of public health directors, politicians, experts in infectious disease control, government scientific and political advisers, NHS leaders and emergency planners about the years leading up to the pandemic.They described how an infrastructure that was once in place to respond to public health crises was fractured, and in some places demolished, by policies introduced by recent Conservative governments, with some changes going as far back as Labour's years in power.""The undermining of our responsiveness to a pandemic was one of my major concerns,"" said Gabriel Scally, a professor of public health at the University of Bristol and a former regional director of public health in the NHS for almost 20 years. ""There has been a destruction of the infrastructure that stops England coping with major emergencies. It absolutely explains why you're now seeing private companies being brought into these functions.""                   Councils left in the dark                   Local authorities are the Cinderellas of government, their work often overlooked. But in the middle of a public health crisis, counties, districts and boroughs traditionally become the foot soldiers of national response. Few have been as badly hit as the east London borough of Newham, the local authority with the highest Covid-19 mortality rate in England and Wales.Yet Newham's director of public health, Jason Strelitz, was left in the dark at the start. He had no official notification that the virus had arrived in his area in mid-March, and only found out when he logged on to the government's public coronavirus tracker web page to make his daily check on the declared numbers. Strelitz did not know who in Newham had Covid-19, where they had been tested, or which part of the borough they came from.""We're really concerned about the way national testing has been set up,"" Strelitz said. ""We still don't have a clear picture of who is being tested in our area nor of the extent of community transmission in Newham.""In normal times, a Public Health England (PHE) representative would be expected to contact Strelitz's environmental health teams if a case of a notifiable disease was found in the area that needed following up, enabling them to set to work tracing contacts and containing an outbreak. But the government had just abandoned community testing and tracing so local authorities were not being contacted at that point.Newham is among the most deprived boroughs in the country. Like all the public health directors interviewed by the Guardian, Strelitz has deep knowledge of the characteristics of his patch that make its health inequalities so stark and its residents so vulnerable to the disease. About 30,000 people have been identified by the council as being at high risk - many of them over 70, living alone and isolated.Even now, with large-scale community testing resumed, Strelitz said he was not receiving useful test data from the centralised, privately contracted operation created by Hancock. He also has concerns about the contact-tracing operation being set up.In addition to the contact-tracing app, the government has once more turned to outsourcing companies, including Serco and Sitel, to recruit and train 25,000 contact tracers. Working on a salary just above minimum wage, the majority will have no medical training. Using scripts, they will contact those who have tested positive, trace people they have been in contact with, and advise them on how to isolate.""Contact tracing is a sensitive issue - I'm not sure how well it can be done with a remote call centre with no understanding of people's local context,"" Strelitz said.Dominic Harrison, the director of public health for Blackburn and Darwen, has similar concerns. Speaking earlier this month he said there was ""a huge disconnect"" between different branches of government, with some functions of the local public health system having been disabled in recent years.""People like environmental health officers, community and neighbourhood teams, youth services workers - the people who you could deploy in a crisis, who already know where the vulnerable are and how to reach them - those were the kind of staff they used during 2009 swine flu to work closely with the NHS, but they have been lost,"" Harrison said.The Labour leader of Nottingham city council, David Mellen, said Conservative ministers had spent so many years shrinking the state locally ""they have forgotten what local authorities can do"". Nottingham has had its central government support grant cut by 80% since 2013 and, like many other councils, no longer has reserves for emergencies such as coronavirus. The Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government has made an emergency grant of £3.2bn to councils for Covid-19 costs, which the communities secretary, Robert Jenrick, has defended as fair and generous. Mellen disagrees. Nottingham, he said, had been given £19.8m as its share of the exceptional grant, but had already spent well over £12m extra on Covid-19 while losing at least £19m in revenue because of the lockdown.A Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) spokesperson did not dispute that cuts to central government grants could have had an impact on local public health networks. However, she pointed to the £3.2bn emergency funding for councils, which she said was in addition to an increase of £2.9bn in councils' core spending power this year. ""Protecting the public's health is, and has always been, a priority for the UK government,"" she said.                   A decade of austerity                   Next month, Britain will mark an anniversary many Conservative ministers would rather forget. Shortly after 12.30pm on 22 June 2010, George Osborne stepped up to the dispatch box as chancellor of the new coalition government and announced the longest and            deepest period of cuts to public service spending since the second world war.Ushering in a new age of austerity to a raucous Commons, Osborne outlined £81bn of cuts over five years. His aim was twofold: to eliminate the government's budget deficit and to reduce its debt as a share of GDP. The emergency budget would, he said, bring the country back from the brink of ruin. ""It pays for the past. It plans for the future. And it protects the most vulnerable in our society,"" Osborne told MPs.It was the prime minister, David Cameron, who had the previous year introduced the notion of ""the age of irresponsibility giving way to the age of austerity"". He said he expected the public spending cuts would be permanent as the private and voluntary sectors stepped in to deliver public services better than the state could. Some government departments would be cut by a third and most public sector workers would have to accept a pay freeze.Along with welfare, some of the most brutal reductions were imposed on local government in England as Osborne transferred the political risk of austerity to councils. Over the next decade, local authorities had 60% of their funding from central government cut, according to the Local Government Association. At the same time their ability to increase council tax, to try to replace the lost revenue, was capped. The cuts            fell disproportionately on those authorities with the poorest populations.Cameron promised he would ""cut the deficit, not the NHS"" and Osborne ringfenced its budget. It got cash increases, but these were less than 1% a year, and failed to keep pace with growing demand from an ageing population.Approximately 32,000 overnight beds have been lost from hospitals in England in just over a decade, including some lost under Labour. Allyson Pollock, a professor of public health at Newcastle University, points out that the number of beds lost is roughly the same as the beds the NHS had to scramble            to free up for Covid-19 patients.When the coronavirus spread to Europe earlier this year, the UK ranked 24th among European countries for its numbers of critical care beds, with 6.6 per 100,000 population, compared with Germany, which topped the league with 29.2 per 100,000.                   NHS fragmentation                   Two years after Osborne's announcement, with austerity beginning to bite, the then health secretary, Andrew Lansley, embarked on a complete market-oriented restructuring of the NHS. Despite Cameron's pre-election promise that there would be no more pointless, disruptive top-down reorganisations, critics argue that Lansley's 2012 Health and Social Care Act did just that.Labour had done its fair share of subjecting the NHS to upheaval. Its programme of building new hospitals under the private finance initiative required other hospital and community health services to close, and shrank bed numbers to help cover the high annual fees to private companies. It accelerated changes brought in by the Conservatives to mimic a market, and created NHS trusts that could operate as semi-autonomous corporate bodies. By 2006, Labour's reorganisations had created 152 primary care trusts (PCTs). Overarching priorities were set by regional strategic health authorities and the Department of Health.But every area still had a Public Health Observatory, which included infectious disease control teams. Under government pandemic plans, each had to identify rapid response teams for testing and tracing, and these were activated during the swine flu outbreak in 2009.Health authorities also had consultants in communicable disease control appointed at senior level on a par with NHS hospital consultants. An independent public body, the Health Protection Agency (HPA), provided specialist support on the threat of emerging diseases. There were critics of the structures, but in planning for emergencies there was, at least, a clear chain of command and control. ""Labour started the process of fragmenting public health but it was at least still integrated with communicable disease control and the NHS,"" Pollock said.Lansley's legislation did away with much of that. He abolished PCTs and strategic health authorities. Instead, existing public health structures were stripped out of the NHS and redistributed, along with their budgets and staff. In a dramatic shift, local authorities were given responsibility for public health for their areas, with larger ones being required to appoint a director of public health.""They took a perfectly well-functioning public health system and fractured it,"" said Julie Hotchkiss, a PCT director with responsibility for emergency pandemic response who moved to York city council during the changes. She said it took her a year to work out where her infectious disease control nurses had gone. ""No one knew and there was no one to ask.""Dr Jeanelle de Gruchy, the president of the Association of Directors of Public Health, argues it was right for local authorities to have a key role in tackling health inequalities, which tend to relate to people's living circumstances and socio-economic status. She regards the transfer of public health to local authorities as ""incredibly important and positive"". But she adds: ""It's a very big job and the transition came at a time of cuts to the public sector, not just to local government, although those were huge.""Lansley's act also created an entirely new agency that has been at the centre of the response to the coronavirus outbreak: Public Health England. It was given two primary responsibilities: improving health and reducing inequalities by tackling ""lifestyle"" diseases, such as obesity; and protecting the public from infectious diseases and environmental hazards.The HPA, which had previously taken a lead on infectious disease control, was folded into PHE. Martin McKee, a professor of European public health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, argues the result of all these new arrangements was ""a hugely weakened and fragmented public health system with consequences writ large in Covid-19"".The DHSC rejected the suggestion that the system was fragmented and that changes had affected the government's ability to respond. Lord Lansley did too. He told the Guardian that an independent review of the public health changes from 2013 published by the the King's Fund thinktank in January, ""concluded that they were the right reforms, but were not supported subsequently by the right level of resources"". Combating health threats, such as pandemics, was ""no more or less fragmented"" after 2013, Lansley said, and the problem was not the new structures or moving public health to local government but money. ""Our intention was for a real-terms increase in public health budgets alongside those for the NHS, but this was not followed through from 2015 onwards,"" he said.The ringfenced annual grant for public health from central government to local authorities - currently about £3.2bn - has been cut by a cumulative £850m in real terms since 2015-16, according to the King's Fund review.During his two-decade career in government, Scally had been involved in emergency responses for swine flu, foot and mouth, BSE, and the fuel crisis. For previous epidemics, he said, the government took ""a public health approach; go in quick and hard, test, trace, isolate, throw everything at it"". But, he said, ""the whole system was demolished"" by Lansley's changes, which led him to resign.He then worked as an adviser for Labour's former shadow health secretary, Andy Burnham, who is now the mayor of Greater Manchester. Burnham recalls Scally constantly warning him as Lansley's bill was going through parliament that ""we were losing pandemic preparedness"".                   Testing time for Public Health England                   No branch of government appears to have received more flak over its handling of the Covid-19 outbreak than Public Health England. The government's chief scientific adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance, suggested it had failed to expand testing at the right moment. Its top executive has been criticised by leading public health experts, such as Prof Anthony Costello of University College London, for being ""invisible"".Even before the outbreak, the agency was a target of complaints from across the spectrum. Leftwing critics have accused PHE of failing to be tough enough in its role of promoting better health. The right has accused it of being the instrument of a nanny state with a bloated budget. PHE has had precious few political friends. But even those who might be natural allies - like Prof John Ashton, the former regional director of public health for north-west England - suggest it has ""had a bad Covid war"".Some of this might be down to bad luck. Its chief executive, Duncan Selbie, caught the virus along with key advisers in Westminster, and its emeritus medical director and director for health protection until 2019, Prof Paul Cosford, has cancer and has been self-isolating, although both have been working throughout.However, there have also been structural challenges. The Lansley act created an agency that lacked independence from government, in contrast to its predecessor, the HPA. That has led to suspicions that some PHE decisions were politically influenced, such as the varying guidance on what kind of personal protective equipment (PPE) was needed for frontline staff treating Covid-19 patients. In late March, PHE said a lower specification of protective gowns than previously advised could be used, leading unions to accuse it of basing decisions on shortages of PPE, rather than evidence. This month, it            downgraded the type of masks NHS workers should use ""as a pragmatic approach for times of severe shortage"".PHE disputes that it was slow off the mark, and Selbie points out that it rolled out the details for its first diagnostic test in January, making it ""the fastest deployment of a novel test in recent UK history"". It says the guidance on PPE has been misunderstood: it was offering a solution in the event of extreme shortages.""Our track record speaks for itself,"" a PHE spokesperson said. ""During 2018-19 alone, we responded to more than 10,000 disease outbreaks and emergencies across England, including meningitis, measles, E coli and the first ever UK case of monkeypox. Our flu vaccination programme grows every year and cases of TB have fallen to the lowest level since records began."" They said that far from being invisible, Selbie had been at the coalface, helping to advise government on its decision-making.The DHSC spokesperson cited a positive report by the International Association of National Public Health Institutes, which described PHE as a ""strong, capable, coordinated, united and efficient public health agency"". The report only examined PHE and not the public health systems devolved to local authorities. The same report pointed out that ""there is scope for greater clarity in the responsibilities of PHE's local partners"".In its defence, PHE has had to absorb disparate functions since its creation in 2013. And it too has been struck by austerity: a public health source said PHE's operational budget sustained a 40% real-terms cut between 2013 and 2019.It was PHE that initially had responsibility for testing, tracing and advising isolation for those who became infected. It was a huge and complicated task, but one the World Health Organization has made clear from the outset was the single most important thing countries could do to suppress the disease. The government's decision to abandon large-scale testing and tracing on 12 March remains one of its most controversial decisions.PHE says it reprioritised limited resources rather than abandoning tracing completely. ""When the lockdown began, our contact-tracing resource was refocused on to complex outbreaks in care homes, prisons and immigration centres,"" Selbie said. ""The good news is, now that we have testing capacity in place and are working towards recovery, we can start mass contact tracing through the NHS test and trace programme.""PHE's contact tracing during the ''contain' phase of the pandemic bought several weeks of time for the government and the NHS to prepare for what was to come, and has undoubtedly saved lives,"" he said.•Coronavirus - latest updates•See all our coronavirus coverageGreg Clark, the chair of the Commons science and technology select committee, accused PHE of choosing to ""concentrate"" tests in its own limited number of labs rather than expanding capacity rapidly by using university and private labs, as the Germans and South Koreans had done, even though the need for mass testing was ""identifiable from the beginning"". PHE responded by blaming the DHSC, saying it was responsible for decisions on testing policy.The DHSC spokesperson said: ""Although Britain had a world-class pharmaceutical industry, it did not have the existing diagnostic base necessary to test hundreds of thousands of people each week for a new virus."" She said the government had more than doubled the capacity of NHS and PHE laboratories since early March, with more than 3m tests carried out by mid-May, and that anyone with symptoms could now book a test.The government boasts that its new Test and Trace programme will mobilise an ""army"" of contact tracers. But in the two months leading up to 12 March, PHE's team resembled no more than a small platoon. The Guardian has established it consisted of just 70 staff in its field services, 120 in local health protection teams, and 20 specially recruited clinical staff. In total, the contact tracing operation to manage the pandemic consisted of just 210 people.Documents released on Friday by the government's Scientific Advisory Group on Emergencies (Sage) suggest the contact-tracing operation initially only envisaged the need to deal with a handful of cases a week. Minutes from an 18 February meeting of the group said: ""Currently PHE can cope with five new cases a week (requiring isolation of 800 contacts)."" The minutes added: ""Modelling suggests this capacity could be increased to 50 new cases a week (8,000 contact isolations) but this assumption needs to be stress-tested with PHE operational colleagues.""Rather than ramp-up capacity, the government scientists instead agreed in the same meeting they would need data ""to feed into trigger points for decisions on when the current monitoring and contact-tracing approach is no longer working"". The minutes added: ""When there is sustained transmission in the UK, contact tracing will no longer be useful.""PHE said the reference to five cases a week was based on modelling of how it would cope with tracking the contacts of imported cases of Covid-19. In a statement, it added: ""PHE could deal with 5 new cases a week and the associated isolation of 800 contacts - which was sufficient capacity at the time - and modelling suggested it had the capacity to scale up significantly as needed.""However, two days later, at another Sage meeting, the advisers acknowledged ""individual cases could already have been missed"" and again discussed when it would be appropriate to abandon the nascent operation. Appearing to acknowledge such a move would be controversial, the minutes said: ""Any decision to discontinue contact tracing will generate a public reaction - which requires consideration with input from behavioural scientists.""By the time community tracing was shelvedin mid-March, PHE had ""contact traced"" only 3,500 people who were likely to have been in close proximity with infected people on flights, cruises or other places where there were known outbreaks. Of those, only 3% tested positive for Covid-19 and were advised to self-isolate.In other words, PHE had managed to identify and warn about 100 people with Covid-19 who might otherwise have spread the disease - a tiny fraction of the infected people. Vallance said there were 5,000 confirmed Covid cases when the community testing and tracing programme stopped, but epidemiologists at Imperial College London            estimated 1.8 million people in Britain were infected by the end of March.William Hanage, a professor of infectious disease epidemiology at Harvard University, said the numbers of PHE staff dedicated to contact tracing in Britain in the weeks leading up to mid-March was shocking. ""I am sure that the people involved in this programme worked incredibly hard, and I have the utmost respect for them, tasked with doing this in the face of a global pandemic,"" he said. ""But it beggars belief to see these numbers held up as adequate.""                   The elusive 100,000 target                   On 2 April, three weeks after capacity had been overwhelmed and PHE had abandoned testing in the community, Hancock announced a five-pillar testing plan. He pledged to scale up the country's testing capacity to reach a target of 100,000 tests a day by the end of the month.But the architecture created in the postwar years to respond to pandemics was no longer standing. In the past, the Public Health Laboratories Service had been tasked with disease control, and with coordinating support and advice to the NHS and others. In 2003, Labour folded it into the HPA. Fifty PHLS labs that existed two decades ago have been merged with hospital labs or ""consolidated"" by successive governments to make efficiency savings. As of January this year, just eight laboratories remained under direct PHE control, along with 122 NHS labs in England.Hancock expected hospital labs testing patients and staff and PHE to make up 25,000 of the ambitious 100,000 target. For the other 75,000 he turned to the private sector. Deloitte, one of the big four accountancy firms, was asked to set up a network of 50 drive-through rapid testing centres, and yet more private companies, such as Serco, Sodexo, Mitie and G4S, would operate and manage the day-to-day running of them.A lab network to process the tests was also established. Deloitte was again given the coordinating role in the creation of new Lighthouse labs in Milton Keynes, Glasgow, Belfast and Cheshire and a further facility in Cambridge, with day-to-day running entrusted to a coalition of private and public partners, including universities and drug companies.But Hancock's 2 April announcement made no mention of one of the main purposes of testing: tracking or tracing.The Guardian soon received reports from people trying to get tested of chaos at some sites, with results going astray, dangerously leaking swab samples arriving at labs, queues of more than three hours and symptomatic people being unable to book a test or told to make round trips of more than 100 miles to test centres. Many still report results taking seven to 10 days to arrive - too long to be useful for quarantine purposes - but the DHSC maintains that 97% of test results are obtained within 48 hours.In the last week of April, the government changed its criteria for counting tests to include ones that had been dispatched, even if they had not been received, returned or processed. The date of 30 April came and Hancock missed his 100,000 target; the number of tests conducted that day was 81,611. But the next day, on 1 May, he appeared to smash it, as 122,347 tests were recorded in government data. The magic number had, by Hancock's own admission, included nearly 30,000 postal tests sent out but not yet analysed. By 3 May the number was back down to 76,496, and the government would fail to meet its target for the next seven days, before getting back on track on 11 May.For Chris Hopson, the chief executive of NHS Providers, which represents foundation trusts in England, Hancock's single-minded focus on reaching an arbitrary number cost the country another precious month. ""Too much of April was wasted by focusing on the 100,000 tests by 30 April target at the expense of other aspects of a clear strategy,"" he said. ""The testing strategy, if there was one, got hijacked on the basis of just meeting that target when there were lots of other things that needed to be done.""Hopson said the saga also illustrates the danger of trying to control testing from the centre. ""We need to be ready to do test, track and trace in every part of the country. That can only be done effectively with greater local control.""",Newspaper
129,"Let's throw everything at Britain's litter problem;Detritus of post-lockdown parties shames us all but instead of asking people nicely to clear up, we need to compel them","June 29, 2020 Monday",International,The Times (London),1090,1090,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,Clare Foges,"Let's throw everything at Britain's litter problemDetritus of post-lockdown parties shames us all but instead of asking people nicely to clear up, we need to compel them","Oh, to be in England, Now that July's nearly there, And whoever wakes in England Sees, some morning, unaware, That the verges are blooming with Costa cups and the ground is soft with ciggie butts, While the chip-wrapper clings to the orchard bough In England - now!The end-of-lockdown bacchanals that took place last week were unedifying in many ways - the drunkenness, the brawling, the selfishness of those who would waste the last three months of national sacrifice to enjoy a square foot of beach - but most dispiriting to me was the detritus left behind: beaches and beauty spots dotted for miles with beer bottles, McDonald's cartons, sweet wrappers, soiled nappies, plastic bags.At Sandbanks there were used sanitary towels and hundreds of gas canisters. A litter pick at Morecambe beach yielded 25 black sacks of waste. Three tonnes of litter at Durdle Door, twelve tonnes left on Bournemouth beach in a single day. Some people had defecated in burger boxes and left them. On Port Meadow in Oxford, the ""deluge of litter"" left five horses and ten cows needing treatment for glass cuts; another cow is dead, having eaten plastic bags and balloons.Last week's plastic carnage was not some aberration but confirmation that Britain's litter problem is truly dire. According to the Hygiene Council, ours is the dirtiest developed country in the world. About 122 tonnes of cigarette-related litter are dropped every day. Councils spend hundreds of millions a year clearing it all up - too late for the creatures who die as a result of the pollution. The RSPCA receives about 5,000 calls a year about litter-related injuries to animals. Our rivers, lakes and seas have become a soup of plastic particles; at the last count there were an average of 358 items of litter per square kilometre of seabed.An army of litter-pickers do sterling work but, alas, the task is Sisyphean. The stuff grows and grows, a pullulating swarm of kebab wrappers and Fanta cans. Behavioural scientists have observed that the strongest predictor of littering is litter. The sight of a plastic bag dancing in the wind suggests it is OK to lob your crisp packet into the hedge. This accretion of rubbish then suggests our common spaces are ripe for further trashing.In the 1980s the American academics James Q Wilson and George L Kelling introduced the ""broken windows theory"", which holds that when an environment is run-down people are more likely to deface it further. Dereliction deepens. Litter breeds litter. The air of abandonment signals to criminals that here is a place to vandalise or steal from.Litter is poisonous to morale, too. A pile of junk in a beautiful place is not only an eyesore but a heartsore, evidence that others think manners and civility are for mugs. The American humorist David Sedaris (who now lives in Britain and is a devoted litter-picker) captures well the rage of the non-littering masses: ""Why should anyone have to live in a teenager's bedroom? It's bad for your spirit ... to have to walk through filth is no way to live.""In many other nations this issue is recognised as important to national pride, and is treated accordingly. German shopkeepers are required by law to keep the pavements in front of their premises litter-free. In Canada, fines for littering are eye-watering; Calgary, the world's cleanest city, takes $750 from those caught dropping a cigarette out of a car window. Leave a sweet wrapper on the floor in squeaky Singapore and risk a $300 fine. The godfather of the city state, Lee Kwan Yew, was relentless in his quest for cleanliness because he believed it would ""keep morale high ... and so create the necessary social conditions for higher economic growth"". It's the unbroken windows theory; clean streets lead to pride, higher aspirations and, ultimately, greater prosperity.Litter matters, but what can we do? Anti-littering campaigns are the usual answer but seeing the volume of rubbish last week, they seem inadequate. If people are thick-headed enough to leave their KFC cartons on the grass in the first place, I doubt that a strongly-worded poster will get through. Instead of simply asking people to do the right thing, we must force them to do it.On-the-spot-fines must be much higher. The think tank Bright Blue recently suggested a minimum of £500 for a first offence, which would be a serious deterrent (though doubling the current ceiling fine to £300 seems hefty enough to me). Most importantly, fines must be enforced. Why not have litter wardens on crowded summer beaches and parks, like parking wardens? Another good idea would be to require fast food drive-throughs to print the car's registration number on all packaging, so that the milkshake cup lobbed out of the car window comes back to bite.For repeat offenders there should be community service, as they have in enlightened California: 24 hours of roadside litter picking for a third offence. Nothing is more likely to make the selfish see the light than hours with a litter-picking claw in hand, in all weathers. Some will balk at such tactics, seeing them as a bit Singaporean and authoritarian for freedom-loving England - but is it perhaps our live-and-let-live attitudes that have helped bring us to this dirty pass in the first place? Young people must experience this problem in a hands-on way, too.Teenagers and young people are the worst culprits for littering (not a curmudgeonly assumption but fact). Exhorting them to behave more considerately through dry, textbook-style education on the environment isn't going to work. They need to learn the habits of cleanliness, order and responsibility. In Japan, schoolchildren must ensure their desk and wider classroom are immaculate before they can go. Why can't we have this kind of discipline in British schools, along with regular litter picks from local areas? In addition, install more bins; empty said bins more regularly (the litter bins of the Swiss capital Bern are emptied up to ten times daily); encourage supermarkets to pioneer more reusable packaging and slash packaging in general; revive the idea of a 25p ""latte levy"" on single-use coffee cups (stopped by the government last year); hold Highways England to account for the mess by the motorways.Britain's litter problem can be desperately dispiriting - and now, in the manner of the canniest fly-tippers, we must throw the kitchen sink, mattress and fridge freezer at it. National cleanliness is at issue, but national pride is at stake.When an environment is already run-down people deface it further",Newspaper
130,Fears of outbreaks in 'sweatshops' for migrant workers,"July 1, 2020 Wednesday",International,The Times (London),585,585,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,Chris Smyth,Fears of outbreaks in 'sweatshops' for migrant workers,"The cramped living conditions of workers in Leicester have led to plans for pop-up isolation centres in hotels to contain the coronavirus, with the city's textile industry also causing concern.However, the government conceded that the source of the outbreak had still not been found, as it emerged that flareups of the virus are hidden from local residents because published data does not include most cases.While the city council says that there have been 944 cases confirmed in Leicester in the past two weeks, data published by the government shows 79. It emerged yesterday that the public data includes only hospital cases and excludes tests carried out by four mobile testing units sent to the city.Ministers are now under pressure to publish detailed local statistics. Matt Hancock, the health secretary, has promised to release ""all the data on test results, in order to ensure that the wider public, as well as directors of public health, are able to access that data"" but no date has been set.Sir Peter Soulsby, the mayor of Leicester, asked Boris Johnson yesterday to provide data on the ethnicity and employment of those tested in order to better trace outbreaks, saying that he finally had street-level data on where cases were happening. ""We're still trying to work through the mountain of stuff that's now come through and try to map it and to see where in the community the virus is still active and where it might be spreading,"" he said.Jonathan Ashworth, the shadow health secretary and Leicester South MP, said: ""Detailed data must flow to local authorities regularly and rapidly because taking on this virus we must always act with speed. We need transparency. Local people need to be able to see all the data, not just a snapshot so people can understand the situation in their local authority.""A lockdown should be effective but it is a blunt tool. Gathering intelligence is crucial to breaking chains of transmission.""In the two weeks since alarm bells first rang about Leicester, factories and schools have been shut and intensive testing introduced but Mr Hancock told the BBC: ""These sorts of much more targeted measures have worked in other outbreaks. So we've been taking this highly localised approach but unfortunately that targeted action wasn't working in Leicester.""He said ""we are still doing the work to understand exactly why the outbreak has been so bad in Leicester"", adding that factors such as poverty, ethnic diversity with many generations under one roof and language problems were ""familiar"" to him.The city's large textile industry is also being considered, and Andrew Bridgen, the Conservative MP for North West Leicestershire, condemned some factories as ""sweatshops"". He told the BBC that the city had ""a very large garment industry which should have locked down, which my sources are telling me have worked for internet retailers who have been very busy during lockdown and they've carried on working as well"".Public health officials suspect that large numbers of migrant workers sharing accommodation and workplaces could be a factor and are looking at reserving hotel rooms so that people can self-isolate away from colleagues.Professor Linda Bauld, a behavioural scientist at the University of Edinburgh, said: ""The restrictions being reintroduced are not the fault of the local population. We need to ask real questions about the adequacy of the UK government's response to this whole crisis and whether it has, most immediately, failed the people of Leicester.""",Newspaper

132,Nicola and Boris must foster national unity;Different roads out of lockdown across the UK would kill our,"May 10, 2020 Sunday",International,The Sunday Times (London),901,901,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,Gillian Bowditch,Nicola and Boris must foster national unityDifferent roads out of lockdown across the UK would kill our,"hat could induce you to break lockdown? Not that I'm advocating it, you understand but we all have our tipping point.WFor Catherine Calderwood, the former chief medical officer for Scotland, it was family trips to her holiday cottage. For Professor Neil Ferguson, the government advisor, it was trysts with his lover Antonia Staats - his vital Staats, so to speak.I'm ashamed to say that for me it would be a session with my hairdresser. When Boris's baby arrived with a full head of quarantine hair, it was a clear sign from the gods that the nation's hairdressers needed to get back to work.As the late Margo MacDonald knew, you should never underestimate the restorative power of a good cut and colour. That hairdressers may feel differently about the risks needed to service the vanity of others is entirely understandable.Everyone's thoughts are turning to loosening lockdown. The Scottish government has started a consultation exercise with the public to see what they would like lifted first. The answer appears to be golf.But what is striking is that for every person desperate to hug a grandchild, there are plenty who do not want to see lockdown lifted until a proven treatment or vaccine is developed. The big lesson from this pandemic is how quickly and easily people have adapted to the restrictions placed on their lives.Faced with the message that a previously unknown, untreatable and, for some, deadly virus is sweeping the globe and that the safest place to be is isolated indoors, it is hardly surprising that people are reluctant to play lockdown roulette.Loss-aversion theory comes into play here, too. First advanced by the psychologists Amos Tversky and Nobel laureate Daniel Kahneman, in 1979, it proposes that losing something affects us more strongly than gaining something of equal value. Losing £100 will make you feel up to twice as bad as winning £100 makes you feel good because we weigh negative events more than positive ones. Innately, we gravitate towards minimising our losses rather than maximising our gains.But as more information comes to light about the virus, a growing cohort is questioning the severity of lockdown, the factors that make a difference to the progress and intensity of Covid-19, and the reliability of the model on which government advice has been based.Consensus among sceptics is as prevalent as hen's dentures, however. Without total transparency around the scientific advice, the original code used in the modelling, and trends in the spread and severity of the disease, it is difficult to see how agreement can be reached.This is a dangerous time in the pandemic, not because of academic dissent or any splintering of resolve on our part, but because the fragile détente among politicians is fracturing.The SNP government's roadmap to power is predicated on a sense of Scottish exceptionalism and in some instances they have been right. Our geography and demography mean that in certain situations Scottish problems need, if not Scottish solutions, then different solutions. But these are few and far between. The response to the coronavirus outbreak is certainly not one of them.Nicola Sturgeon has (politically) outlived two prime ministers. There is nothing clubbable about her and she has perfected the throughgritted-teeth approach to cooperation with Westminster. Boris has gone out of his way to be rude and antagonistic about her in the past.There has been a degree of depressing but predictable petty one-upmanship over the past few weeks, which most of us have been prepared to overlook because running a government at present is nobody's idea of a picnic.But throughout history, collaborative solutions to mutual problems have been the bedrock of progress. If ever there were a time for the wisdom of crowds, it is now.A fundamentally different approach to loosening lockdown in Scotland and England would be disastrous, not just because of the confusion and resentment it would cause. Or because of the additional difficulties businesses that operate across the border would face. But because it would squander the one positive in this crisis - a sense of unity and togetherness.Ultimately, we all face different risks and we all have different approaches to risk.Individuals must be allowed to make their own assessment of the risk to themselves and their loved ones within the official parameters.But in a pandemic that has been characterised by speculation based on poor, confusing and incomplete data, the public has been united in its approach. Communities have come together to support vulnerable members without any need of government direction or organisation. Businesses have supported each other. Networks have sprung up.The hallmark of this pandemic has been cooperation, collectivism, accessibility and positivity. There will be a time for inquiry and examination, but it is not now. We went into this as one and we should come out of it together. If the national consensus is breached for reasons of political point scoring, both leaders will find it harder to manage in the long run.You cannot put a kilt on coronavirus. Nobody governs in isolation in a pandemic. Getting into bed with the prime minister may well be the first minister's personal tipping point. But the inconvenient truth is that Nicola needs Boris and Boris needs Nicola.@GillianBowditchIf ever there were a time for the wisdom of crowds, it is now",Newspaper
133,"Why the home-working boom could tumble London's skyscrapers;As UK firms opt to remain remote, the future of flagship office projects in the City and beyond could be under threat","June 27, 2020 Saturday",International,The Observer (London),1581,1581,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,Julia Kollewe,"Why the home-working boom could tumble London's skyscrapersAs UK firms opt to remain remote, the future of flagship office projects in the City and beyond could be under threat","As England prepares to return to pubs, restaurants and cinemas next week, vast numbers of offices around the country will remain empty. And some companies are happy for it to stay that way - which poses a serious problem for multimillion pound skyscraper projects under way in the capital.London-based Bishopsgate Financial Consulting is one of a growing number of firms that are giving up or downsizing their offices in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic.""We were planning to move offices. We'd given notice just before the lockdown came in,"" says Mike Hampson, chief executive of Bishopsgate. ""When we started working remotely, we realised we were working very effectively as we were.""So, after a discussion with his 65 staff, he decided to give up the firm's head office in the capital's Square Mile financial district. The move will save the company hundreds of thousands of pounds a year, slicing a quarter off its annual costs. Employees will also benefit financially - with some saving thousands of pounds each in annual commuting bills. Hampson himself has been spending more than £5,000 a year commuting from Tonbridge in Kent.Bishopsgate has bought desks, laptops, dual screens and printers for its staff to use at home, while taking a ""virtual office"" in the City of London, which at least gives the firm an office address along with access to meeting rooms and lounges when it needs them. Vantage Point Global, which trains graduates for banks including UBS and Credit Suisse and employs 45 people, has also given up its head office near the Bank of England headquarters in the Square Mile.""From 1 April we were out of the office,"" says James Brincat, Vantage's chief executive. ""It's got an impact on the bottom line ... We are working perfectly well, almost better than before. People are happy they can cut out the commute."" Access to a ""workplace club"" nearby allows the firm to use meeting rooms and lounges certain days a month, while the cost is a fraction of the previous rent bill. These decisions are being taken against a backdrop of a global pandemic - and a mass of construction cranes. Although many businesses might be reluctant to return to their office buildings, a number of substantial building projects in the capital are dependent on them sticking to the old way of corporate life. Around the corner from Bishopsgate and Vantage, the UK's biggest commercial tower projects are banking on a reunion round the water cooler and pushing ahead with building superstructures, in defiance of warnings that modern working could take years to return to pre-covid normality.The lockdown-related economic slowdown, severe restrictions on public transport use and the likely retention of physical distancing guidelines for a long period have cast a pall over the cornerstone of the modern service economy: the open-plan office. Millions of furloughed or socially distanced workers are leaving desks unattended around the country, and there are signs that the change could be permanent.Last month, Facebook said as many as half its 48,000 employees could be working from home within a decade, while Canadian e-commerce firm Shopify followed Twitter in saying its 5,000 employees could work from home permanently. In the UK, the chief executive of Barclays bank, which operates from a tower block in Canary Wharf, has said that ""the notion of putting 7,000 people in the building may be a thing of the past"".One of the City's cornerstone names is embracing change too. Lloyd's of London, the world's biggest insurance market, is working on creating a virtual underwriting room, a new digital platform that will use the best features of video-conferencing apps like Zoom.Lloyd's, which closed its underwriting room in the Square Mile in late March, for the first time in its 334-year history, plans to reopen it in August. It expects that only 20% to 25% of 850 corporation staff and 3,000 to 4,000 brokers and underwriters will return to the Lime Street building in the City, for the time being. But despite the likely decline in demand for office space, for some elements of the construction industry there is no choice other than to get back on the site, start building and hope that workplaces fill up again when their skyscrapers open for business. The capital dominates among the most ambitious plans. Projects getting back under way include the fund manager M&G's 40 Leadenhall Street towers, nicknamed Gotham City for their resemblance to the Batman city, and Mitsubishi Estate London's 8 Bishopsgate, both in the Square Mile.However, if those buildings were always unlikely to be abandoned mid-construction, there is at least hesitation among the developments that are further down the pipeline. In the wake of Covid-19 it is likely that more staff will work from home at least part of the time, suggesting that businesses will need less space - although the requirement for social distancing might make it difficult to slim down offices. While government distancing guidance has switched from 2 metres to 1 metre ""where 2 metres is not viable"", it remains to be seen whether business owners will use that change to seek a wider workforce return to offices. Some construction schemes are therefore likely to pause. Several large projects planned in the City of London are likely to be put on hold, say consultants at Deloitte. They could include 1 Undershaft, known as the Trellis, which would be the second-tallest building in western Europe after the Shard at 290 metres, and where construction had been expected to start by the end of this year; the Diamond, rising to 247 metres; and the Bishopsgate Goodsyard towers.Deloitte is predicting construction delays of three to six months in its recent London crane survey, which monitors office developments, with many of the completions due this year pushed into 2021. Buildings that had been scheduled to finish this year include 22 Bishopsgate, in the City, and Henrietta House in the West End.Very little new construction is expected to start over the next six to nine months. Securing finance is likely to become tougher as the economic downturn deepens, and developers are nervous about being left with empty buildings, or rents falling as vacancies rise.""It's inevitable that with schemes that haven't started people are going to be hesitant,"" says Michael Cracknell, author of the London crane survey. ""Any sensible occupier is going to review their space requirements; 98% of CFOs [chief financial officers] we surveyed said they'd be looking at space and how they're using flexible working arrangements.""Office and apartment-block construction had been booming in the UK's largest cities until the lockdown led to most sites being shut down, but many have reopened in recent weeks.However, productivity has dropped by 30% to 40%, as construction firms try to implement physical distancing guidelines while struggling to get key materials, says Noble Francis, economics director at the Construction Products Association.""This means construction will cost more and take longer,"" he says. ""This could lead to renegotiations of contracts and consequent delays ... and potentially hinder the financial viability of some future developments.""Despite these concerns, projects underway or with planning permission are unlikely to be abandoned. Mat Oakley, head of the UK and European commercial property research team at property firm Savills, says he can only recall one example of a major office development being abandoned during his career: the Pinnacle, which was defeated by the financial crisis and became known as the Stump, later replaced by the 22 Bishopsgate building.The Walkie-Talkie and Cheesegrater skyscrapers in London's financial district were put on hold during the financial crisis, but went ahead once the office market recovered. The question for the sector's boosters is when, and to what extent, the office market will bounce back this time.""The behavioural science question is unique to this crisis,"" says Oakley. ""We don't know how workers will be feeling in three to six months' time, will they be desperate to go into the office, or frightened of going on public transport?""Either way, the rise in home working does not spell the end of the office. Banks, insurers and law firms will still rely on office buildings to ensure staff work in secure network environments because of the risk of cyber-attacks, says Cracknell.Technology, media and telecoms firms, which are now the dominant sources of demand for office space, have seen demand for their products and services boom during the pandemic and could continue to expand.But questions remain over whether buildings designed for massed working in the pre-covid era are fit for purpose now: is the location right for a commuting workforce; will a recovering economy support the kind of firm that employs thousands of people; will offices become a cost cash-strapped companies can live without; and, importantly, do employees want to work in a collective environment after the relative freedom of home-working?Even if the pro-office voices are right, existing sites need to be reconfigured, with more space needed for each worker as firms implement Covid-19 safety guidelines - such as screens between desks and limited attendances at meetings. The future of Gotham City, the Trellis and the Diamond will depend on office workers - after months of commute-free, home-based employment - embracing such a constrained work environment.",Newspaper

His concern comes following reports that the UK economy contracted by more than a fifth in the first full month of lockdown, as shops and factories closed and workers were sent home.The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said that economic activity was down by 20.4 per cent in April - the largest drop in a single month since records began in 1997, and worse than many experts were forecasting.Today, a survey by the Chartered Management Institute (CMI), revealed how 34 per cent of managers are set to make staff redundant due to the impact of coronavirus.As many as 26 per cent are expecting to make the cuts this year, the survey shows. Tomorrow, the economy is set for a major boost when many high street retailers throw open their doors for the first time since draconian lockdown measures, put in place to stem the spread of coronavirus, were introduced.But senior government ministers are bracing for a spike in unemployment figures, which are set to be released in two days. The last month's figure of 1.3million unemployed could rise to two million, government chiefs fear, while, according to The Times, ministers fear it could rise to 4.5million over the next year.In a bid to breath life back into the pandemic hit economy, Boris Johnson will tomorrow pave the way for the abolition of the two-metre separation rule by taking personal control of the decision to axe it. His crucial intervention comes as one of the country's leading restaurateurs warns that if it is not scrapped, the hospitality sector will be hit by millions of job losses.The Mail on Sunday can reveal that the Prime Minister has commissioned a comprehensive No 10 review which will effectively wrest control of Covid-19 social distancing guidance from Government scientists - and, critically, allow the devastating economic impact of the measure to be taken into account for the first time. One Government source said the move was recognition that 'there is more to life than the R number' - the term for the rate at which the infection spreads.Last night, Tory MPs predicted that the review - to be run by Downing Street's newly appointed Permanent Secretary, Simon Case - would provide a road map for the two-metre rule to be relaxed in time for the reopening of pubs on July 4. It comes as Richard Caring, the businessman whose empire includes the J Sheekey restaurant in London and The Ivy chain, tells this newspaper that expecting people to stay more than two metres apart is 'killing the country'.In a rare interview, Mr Caring accuses Mr Johnson of 'weakness and indecision', and said Ministers had grossly underestimated the permanent damage being done to Britain's 26,000 restaurants.Unless the rule is relaxed, Mr Caring warns, as many as '50 or 60 per cent' of the four-million hospitality workers in Britain could be laid off when the Government's furlough scheme comes to an end in the autumn.Mr Caring, a Tory Party donor, adds: 'This volcano, unless we wake up to it now, it's going to be horrendous. It's just going to explode, spewing out unemployed people. The pain and suffering it is going to cause is horrific.'There are estimates saying we could have up to five million unemployed. It's not going to be five million - it's going to be more. I don't think we've seen anything yet. 'The Government is actually killing the country right now and the hospitality industry is in the front line of the disaster'.The insistence of the Government's Scientific Advisory Group on Emergencies (Sage) on maintaining the two-metre rule has caused an intense political backlash, with Tory MPs and the Treasury joining forces to express concern about the economic damage it is wreaking. Figures released last week showed the economy suffered a 20 per cent drop in GDP in April, the largest ever monthly collapse.Chancellor Rishi Sunak told the party's backbench 1922 Committee last week that three-quarters of pubs could open if the distance was cut to one metre, and cited the fact that 24 countries had introduced the flexibility to reduce it.The infection rate in the community has dropped to just 0.06 per cent, while a further 181 people died in the UK in the last 24-hour period to be announced after testing positive for Covid-19.Researchers found that there is a 1.3 per cent chance of contracting the virus when standing two metres away from an infected person; a figure that only increases to 2.6 per cent when separated by one metre.The current 'R' rate is between 0.7 and 0.9: any number below 1 means that the spread of the virus is decreasing.Mr Johnson's new review will take advice from a range of experts, including the Chief Medical Officer Chris Whitty and Chief Scientific Adviser Sir Patrick Vallance - but also behavioural scientists and economists. It will operate in addition to a rolling review of the guidance being carried out by Sage.It comes as today, hundreds of business leaders, charity bosses and city mayors called those out of work are given support, such as training, in what is being described as an 'opportunity guarantee'.Those including the bosses of Heathrow and healthcare giant Bupa signed the letter printed in today's Sunday Times.",Web Publication

However, hospitality companies have warned that they will need to know the plans by Tuesday next week, when rent for the three months from July is due, in order to head off job losses.Tens of thousands of ""non-essential"" shops are to open today, though Mr Johnson admitted on a visit to a shopping centre yesterday that he did not know whether the shoppers would ""come in a flood or a trickle - I hope they will come in sensible numbers"".The UK recorded its lowest daily death toll since before lockdown, with 36 recorded deaths yesterday, and Mr Johnson hinted that he wanted to see the two-metre distance reduced as the virus decreases.He said: ""As we get the numbers down so it becomes one in 1,000, one in 1,600 maybe even fewer, your chances of being two metres, one metre or even a foot away from someone who has the virus is going down statistically, so you start to build some more margin for manoeuvre.""Representatives from the hospitality sector, who are hoping to reopen their businesses after July 4, will press their concerns in a meeting with Paul Scully, the high streets minister, and Simon Clarke, a local government minister, tomorrow. Kate Nicholls, the chief executive of UK Hospitality, said a third of hospitality businesses - 30,000 to 40,000 firms, employing one million people - could start redundancy processes next week if there was no clarity, particularly with the firms having to fund an increased proportion of the salaries of furloughed workers from the end of July.She said: ""Some of them will just go bust at that point ... labour is the only element of their profit and loss account which is totally under their control. ""It is the first thing that goes if there is any cost.""The findings of the No 10 review will be reported to the Covid Strategy Committee, which is chaired by Mr Johnson.It will take advice from a range of experts, including Chief Medical Of- ficer, Chief Scientific Adviser, behavioural scientists and economists. The inclusion of economists is seen as vital so that the interests of businesses can be set against warnings from scientists.Rishi Sunak, the Chancellor, told the BBC that while the Government listened to the advice of scientific advisers, ministers ""were elected to make decisions in this country; people should hold us responsible and accountable for those decisions"".Reports: Page 7 Jane Shilling: Page 1841,698 DEATHS + 36 144,865 DAILY TESTS 44,865 ABOVE TARGET 295,889 CORONAVIRUS CASES IN UK",Newspaper
136,Fears raised over Big Brother watching at home;Technology. Data loss ; Bosses tap analytic tools to check staff as remote working heightens risk of breaches,"May 13, 2020 Wednesday",International,"Financial Times (London, England)",834,834,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,HANNAH MURPHY,Fears raised over Big Brother watching at homeTechnology. Data loss ; Bosses tap analytic tools to check staff as remote working heightens risk of breaches,"As cyber criminals and hackers ramp up their attacks on businesses amid virusrelated disruption, companies are facing another, equally grave, security threat: their employees.Companies are turning to Big Brotherstyle surveillance to stop staff leaking or stealing sensitive data, as millions work away from the watchful eyes of bosses and job cuts leave some disgruntled.A brisk market has sprung up for cyber security groups that wield machine-learning and analytics to crunch data on employee activity and flag worrying behaviours.""We're seeing people say, 'I need better visibility into what my employees are doing with all of our data at home',"" said Joe Payne, chief executive of cloud security group Code42, which examines factors including when an employee typically works, what files they access, and how much data they download.An employer might ask, for example, if it had 10,000 staff, ""who the most high-risk people are,"" he said. His company is handling a rise in cases of data theft among clients.According to Mordor Intelligence, the $1.2bn data loss prevention market is set to hit $3.8bn by 2025, as many businesses migrate data to the cloud.Insider threats encompass employees unintentionally sharing private data outside workplace networks and deliberate stealing of data, typically motivated by money or a grudge. Rarer, but a growing issue, is intellectual property theft and espionage on behalf of foreign governments.More than a third of data breaches involve internal actors, according to a 2019 Verizon analysis of more than 40,000 incidents. At a meeting of corporate cyber security heads at RSA earlier this year, delegates labelled insider threats as their top concern, according to a person in attendance - above nation-state activity and threats from cyber criminals.Traditionally, the likes of McAfee have offered tools that detect and block exfiltration of sensitive data automatically. But newer groups seek to alert employers to anomalous activity through behavioural analysis of data - which can involve screenshots and keystroke-logging - and place the onus on employers to act in a way they see fit.Falling under this category, Code42, Teramind, Behavox and InterGuard said they were seeing a rise in interest from potential clients under lockdown.""There is an increase in people trying to steal intellectual property - reports, or valuable HR data, client lists,"" said Erkin Adylov, chief executive of artificial intelligence group Behavox, which in February raised $100m from Soft-Bank's Vision Fund 2.He said its software analysed 150 data types to produce insights about employees' behaviour, including using natural language processing of email and workplace chats to assess employee sentiment. ""Maybe there is uncertainty about [whether] people are going to [keep] their job,"" he said. ""The market is moving very fast. I would say it's probably growing at a clip of 100 per cent a year. Demand is outstripping supply.""The risk of nation-states opportunistically grooming employees for cyber espionage purposes was also a growing threat, experts said. The issue was thrust into the spotlight when US officials last year charged two Twitter employees with mining data from the company's internal systems to send to Saudi Arabia.""If I were a nation-state actor [involved in cyber espionage] ... certainly this is an opportunity to exploit some realities that exist. This is a heightened environment,"" said Homayun Yaqub, a security strategist at Forcepoint.Executives at Strider Technologies, which wields proprietary data sets and human intelligence to help companies combat economic espionage, said it was seeing more recruitment of foreign spies, particularly by China, taking place online rather than at events and conferences.""We're providing the capability to respond to that adversary tactic,"" said chief executive Greg Levesque.Critics argue that the technology is nascent and further investment is needed to develop a more accurate understanding of what risky patterns of behaviour look like.And while employers have long been able legally to monitor emails and web activity for signs of external cyber security threats, for some, there is discomfort about the privacy and trust implications of using such tools on staff. ""It's intrusive. It's not very culturally palatable,"" said former US army intelligence sergeant and former Palantir executive Greg Barbaccia. ""To me, the insider threat is a cultural human problem. If someone wants to be malicious ... you need to solve the human problem.""Omer Tene, vice-president of the International Association of Privacy Professionals, said: ""Data breaches have been a huge issue. It's understandable why businesses would want to protect against that. I wouldn't be alarmist.""But you need to be aware as a business and a technology of the creepy line. Are you doing anything ... unexpected that will trigger backlash?""'It's intrusive. It's not very culturally palatable. To me, the insider threat is a human problem'",Newspaper
137,Gary Connolly;Investor opportunity is best where the outlook is worst,"May 17, 2020 Sunday",International,The Sunday Times (London),761,761,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,,Gary ConnollyInvestor opportunity is best where the outlook is worst,"Four out of every three people struggle with fractions, goes the old joke about innumeracy. Judging by the nonsense that gets reported, most of us could do with a refresher course in number skills.A BBC online article from 2018 - fretting that a currency had lost 180% of its value - raises an eyebrow. But the one that takes the proverbial biscuit is surely the failure of the thirdpounder hamburger to tempt consumers away from the smaller quarter pounder at McDonald's. Focus groups later confirmed that it floundered on the failure to recognise that the ""three"" in a third is larger than the ""four"" in a quarter.So you can imagine the eye-roll that greeted a recent article about US oil prices plunging by over 100%. After rolling my eyes back, it was clear this wasn't a hamburger-like mistake.So, oil prices can actually fall below zero. Granted it happened only briefly, but it remains on the record. There's another cherished notion about financial markets torn asunder.If we've learnt anything in the past few months, it should be that assumptions you have about the future can be upended overnight.Things change. As Daniel Kahneman says: ""The correct lesson to learn from surprises is that the world is surprising.""In a world where fundamental assumptions about the future are so fragile, we should think about it and our ability to divine it with a great deal of humility.Uppermost in investors' minds today are likely to be questions such as, when will the lockdowns end? What will happen in the travel and hospitality industry? When will there be a vaccine? What sectors should do well out of the crisis? We often look to financial markets for clues as to what the future holds. After all, markets are an exceptionally good discounting mechanism. We are, however, getting some mixed signals from stock markets at the moment.News flow about the next six months looks quite dire. The IMF, which expects global gross domestic product to decline by 3% this year, observed the magnitude and speed of collapse in activity are ""unlike anything experienced in our lifetimes"". The impact on companies will inevitably be severe. This souring of the corporate mood has been accompanied, bizarrely, by a mini-boom in stocks.The S&P 500 is up over 25% from its March 23 low, in euro terms, and as at May was in positive territory year-on-year. And it's the technology sector that has been leading the charge.The stocks that matter most to index returns tend to be well-capitalised secular growers that seem particularly well adapted to operating in the current environment. On main street, news flow may seem dire, but to get a sense of this we need to look beyond mega-caps.Here we see a more nuanced story about Covid-19 impact on financial markets. Rallies in mega-cap firms are masking a much more tepid recovery in the market. The equally weighted version of the S&P 500 remains over 10% below its year-ago level, despite a strong recovery from its lows. This provides a broader representation of corporate America.The concentration at the top of the S&P 500 index has never been so extreme. The largest five companies, all from the tech sector, now represent 22% of the index. The ""S&P 5"", as they are now being referred to - Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Google owner Alphabet and Facebook - easily eclipse the previous peak in concentration back in 2000.The market cap of the largest stocks in the S&P 500 has grown at roughly three times the rate of the broader index in the past six years. According to Michael Batnick of Ritholtz Wealth Management, if these divergent growth rates were to continue, in seven years these five stocks would represent half of the index. For reasons that are obvious, this cannot go on indefinitely.Betting against this winner-takes-all trend has been career hara-kiri for many a fund manager. There aren't any immutable laws in finance. Things are subject to constant change. But as Batnick points out, there's an iron law of pizza which applies to stock markets: the slices of the pie cannot be bigger than the pie itself.There are a few lessons in this for investors. Predicting the winners in this is subject to a high degree of error. Notwithstanding the current dispersion of valuation that arguably creates great opportunity for skilled stock pickers, it's simplest to play this in a diversified fund or exchange-traded fund.Opportunity is best where the outlook is worst. We have to look beyond mainstream stock market indices to find those conditions.Gary Connolly is investment director at Davy Select; gary.connolly@davy.ie",Newspaper
138,REMOTE;BRING STAFF BACK INTO THE OFFICE OR CONTINUE WITH REMOTE WORKING? ROSIE MURRAY-WEST asks the experts how best to navigate a tricky decision…,"June 24, 2020 Wednesday",International,Metro (UK),954,954,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,,REMOTEBRING STAFF BACK INTO THE OFFICE OR CONTINUE WITH REMOTE WORKING? ROSIE MURRAY-WEST asks the experts how best to navigate a tricky decision…,"THE lockdown imperative to work from home has divided the nation. While some have loved the 12-step commute from the bedroom to the dining table, others are counting the days until they can escape to the haven of the office and buy their lunch from Pret A Manger rather than making yet another bog standard sandwich.A survey into employees' feelings about remote working shows a polarised workforce. According to research by Totaljobs, just over half (54 per cent) of us want to return to work by the end of June, but 42 per cent want to work from home indefinitely.A choice now looms over whether to bring employees back to the office or continue with a remote working strategy. Jon Wilson, CEO of Totaljobs, says that employers must communicate clearly and engage with their employees' preferences and fears around workplace return, or risk breaching trust and loyalty that has been built up during the pandemic.'We have needed to adapt over the past couple of months, but the reality is that we are all going to go through change at least one more time as we settle into a new normal,' he says.Home sweet home? While offices have been shuttered, many employers have been considering whether to make remote working the 'new normal'. There are several advantages to this, including a reduction in rental costs and time for those with long commutes. Some have also found that their offices are unlikely to be fit for purpose under new social distancing guidelines.'We decided to give the office up, as we were quite tightly packed and it certainly wouldn't have allowed us to keep to two metres distancing,' explains Steven Mayatt, creative director of Pocket Creatives, a video production company. The team of six had rented a space by the day in Shoreditch prior to lockdown but believe they can be just as productive from home.Closing the office may be a popular move with some staff, too. Property group Cushman & Wakefield found that three quarters of employees would like their companies to embrace permanent flexible working policies.But there is also evidence that remote working can damage staff morale and productivity, with a third claiming they are less productive. 'Given the anxiety from lockdown and the ineffectiveness of managers in this new environment, masses of UK workers are likely either to opt out or burnout,' warns behavioural science expert Octavius Black, Co-founder and CEO of Mind Gym.Making remote working work Octavius says that the answer to the productivity slump is not to bring staff back into an office environment, but to develop new skills in leadership that work remotely. 'The way to prevent this crisis is not to stop remote working, which when properly handled can bring great benefits, but for leaders to step up and develop the new managerial muscles,' he says.Paul Ainley, at employer brand agency Chatter, says that employers will need to think through almost every process if they are to make a success of working remotely.'Processes for hiring and onboarding, through to challenges around performance management, skills, learning, health and wellbeing, safeguarding and more besides, will need to be reviewed and adapted in order to allow for a more permanent adoption of remote working,' he says.Establishing, or re-establishing, an office culture will be vital, with leaders needing to schedule regular video conferences, one-to-one meetings and opportunities to chat.'Ensure that any traditions are upheld and a virtual replacement is crafted and set up,' says Lee Chambers, a psychologist at Essentialise. That means that if you regularly go out for Friday night drinks as a group, you need to carefully consider what might replace this bonding opportunity, such as a Zoom social hour.A hybrid approach While many companies are giving up their offices, others will be keeping some office space but using it differently.Despina Katsikakis, Head of Occupier Business Performance at Cushman & Wakefield, says that offices can be a place of positivity, where employees come less frequently, but connect more strongly.'As we look to the future, the office will have a new purpose: to provide inspiring destinations that strengthen cultural connection, enhance learning, encourage bonding among colleagues and customers, and foster creativity and innovation,' she says.In the short term, some firms will have staff who cannot come back to an office space because they are vulnerable, shielding or caring for children, while others will be anxious about returning and would prefer to be at home.Meddbase, a technology company that provides remote working software to doctors, is one company that says it wanted its own staff members to make up their minds about returning.'We've giving all our staff the choice of working from home until further notice, it's entirely up to them. If their kids aren't in school, we don't expect our employees to come to the office, it's that simple,' says Christine Hart, Chief Service Delivery Officer.Lee, at Essentialise, counsels against forcing employees back to the office. 'It is best to find alternative work or assist them to continue to work remotely while they adapt to the world becoming safer again.' Whatever the 'new normal' looks like for your business, lawyer Katie Fudakowski, Employment Partner at Farrer & Co, says there are legal considerations that you must take into account when allowing some, but not all, employees to work from home.'Implementing a home working policy won't ever be a one-size-fits-all solution, and it is imperative that employers carefully consider the approach they choose to take,' she says. 'At a time of such uncertainty, the communication and understanding between employers and employees is key.'",Newspaper
139,Too many people seek simple explanations for different Covid death rates around the world It's smart to admit you don't know the answer,"May 29, 2020 Friday",International,The Times (London),919,919,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,Ed Conway,Too many people seek simple explanations for different Covid death rates around the world It's smart to admit you don't know the answer,"Here's something that might surprise you: air quality in much of Britain actually deteriorated after lockdown began. I only discovered this when I started trawling through the data in search of some good news. While certain measures of pollution, most notably nitrogen oxides pumped out of car exhausts, fell sharply in April, another type, PM2.5, rose in London and England to the highest level recorded in 2020.PM2.5 is small particulate matter: everything from dust to factory pollution to emissions from industrial agriculture. The increase wasn't due to British drivers and factory workers defying the lockdown, but because pollution from roads, farms and factories in Europe had blown in on easterly winds. Anyway, the wind soon changed direction and PM2.5 levels dropped from their April highs.I would have left the matter there were it not for a paper published by Harvard researchers who concluded that ""a small increase in long-term exposure to PM2.5 leads to a large increase in the Covid-19 death rate"". Now, let's not get carried away. The Harvard research is based on US data and talks about long-term exposure, while London and other parts of England saw a seasonal spike. Nonetheless, it is worth noting that even as Britain faced the peak of deaths, many of its citizens were being exposed to the highest concentration of this dangerous pollutant seen this year. Italian cities most ravaged by the virus also have some of the highest PM2.5 levels in Europe.It is yet another reminder of how little we know about Covid-19. How did Britain suffer one of the worst episodes of the disease in the world? The conventional answer is government failure, and indeed it is hard to imagine how this could have been handled any worse. Yet ours is not the only government to have had missteps, to have been slow to implement testing or a lockdown. In Japan the handling of the crisis by Shinzo Abe, the prime minister, has been castigated, testing levels have been well below many of its neighbours. Yet compared with much of Europe, Japanese infection and mortality numbers are microscopic. Why? Short answer: we don't know.I have a pet theory that much of what is wrong in the world derives, one way or another, from our inability to admit ignorance. You are far more likely to get hired, promoted or elected if you spin seductive stories to answer complex questions rather than expressing doubt and ignorance. The upshot is that the upper tiers of business, politics and the media are stacked with bluffers. They assail us with catch-all narratives to explain Britain's levels of excess deaths. The most popular is that it is all down to lockdown being imposed too late. That might have made a difference but is it really the primary explanation? Why, in that case, have those countries which have now lifted theirs not seen a sudden resurgence in cases and deaths? Why is Norway wondering whether lockdown made much difference at all to its Covid outcome? Japan had no formal lockdown. Nor did Sweden, famously, and while deaths there are well above European averages they are, crucially, only a fraction of what epidemiologists warned of in the event of an uncontained spread.Others argue that lockdown is the problem, not the solution. That it exacerbated mortality and that the pain inflicted by the economic shutdown is more dangerous than the disease itself. But these arguments miss the fact that even if the government hadn't imposed a lockdown we might be behaving much the same anyway.An intriguing study by four behavioural economists for the University of Zurich found a significant proportion of people would avoid putting others at risk of infection even if it entailed a personal economic sacrifice, regardless of any lockdown. They found that the likelihood of someone following social distancing guidelines voluntarily can be predicted by a test showing how reluctant they are to put their own economic interests before someone else's. Economists call this ""prosociality"". Prosociality is pretty high in Sweden, which may explain why many people distanced there without top-down enforcement. It is also high throughout much of Asia, which may explain why that region has fared better in the crisis. Then again, prosociality is typically low in eastern Europe, which has had fewer cases and deaths than the West.The more you probe, the more holes you find. Why did Greece, where prosociality and levels of trust in the government are low, have one of the most successful lockdown policies? Pollution might seem like a seductive narrative to explain certain coronavirus hotspots until you recall that PM2.5 levels are highest in China and India, where mortality is nowhere near European levels.Unlike politicians, scientists have been at pains to emphasise the degree of uncertainty. All of the above may play a part; no single thesis can explain the diverse factors at play. Bad policy, such as failing to shield the elderly, doesn't help but we can't blame politicians for everything.Decades from now we will still be debating what really happened with Covid-19 in much the same way as epidemiologists still argue about the Spanish flu and economists the Great Depression. We will probably still be debating how much difference lockdowns made. But the wisest souls will realise then, as they realise now, that there is no simple narrative that can encompass an event of this scale.Ed Conway is economics editor of Sky NewsScientists have been at pains to emphasise the degree of uncertainty",Newspaper

Jeremy Hunt, the former health secretary and chair of the health and social care select committee, said he was ""very sympathetic to financial support to boost compliance as that has been important in Taiwan and Korea"".The warnings come as the prime minister faces pressure to reopen the economy at a faster pace. Last week's GDP figures showed the UK's economy had shrunk by a record 20.4% in April.However, Johnson's scientific advisers have repeatedly warned that doing so requires a test-and-trace system that is proven to work. There are concerns that the new system could fail if those contacted feel unable to self-isolate. Several figures who have advised the government through the Scientific Pandemic Influenza Group on Behaviours (SPI-B), who said they spoke in a personal capacity, called for a financial package.Professor Chris Bonell, from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and a member of SPI-B, said: ""There is a concern that individuals will not adhere to self isolation if there are financial or other material barriers to this. So individuals need to be properly compensated for lost income, and statutory sick pay will, in many cases, not be sufficient. Self-isolation is critical to preventing a second pandemic wave and so investment in this is likely to be very cost effective.""John Drury, professor of social psychology at the University of Sussex, said: ""Outside the pandemic we know that presenteeism is a real problem and one reason for that is that people feel they can't afford to not come in to work. So yes, I do think there needs to be financial support for people, so that they or their family do not lose out by having to self-isolate. [It] should probably be linked to their normal earnings."" He added that other issues, such as entertainment, loneliness and access to supplies, may also need to be addressed.Robert West, professor of health psychology at UCL, said it ""cannot be right that people take a substantial financial hit for protecting the community"". Gavin Morgan, also from UCL, said any financial package should reflect ""their current income levels"". St Andrews psychology professor Stephen Reicher said the system was ""completely dependent on compliance"" and called for compensation at least part-funded by the private sector.Senior Tory MPs also have concerns. Robert Halfon, chair of the education select committee, said: ""We absolutely have to make it clear that anyone who is self-isolating is going to be able to afford to do so. If you're a courier and you're paid for how many boxes you deliver, how are you going to live?"" Caroline Nokes, the former cabinet minister, said: ""Many will not be able to afford to stay off work... for example, it will be incredibly hard to convince [Uber drivers] they must stay at home when the choice is between doing so and feeding their family."" Former children's minister Tim Loughton said: ""There is definitely an issue around financial impact, particularly on those who cannot work from home.""Torsten Bell, chief executive of the Resolution Foundation, called for those self-isolating to be eligible forthe job retention scheme, under which workers can be furloughed on 80% of their wages. ""For an effective test-and-trace system to operate we need people's family finances to be protected if they are affected,"" he said. Gillian Guy, chief executive of Citizens Advice, said: ""The government has taken bold steps to help many workers throughout the coronavirus crisis, but it needs to look again at how it can support people to do the right thing.""A Treasury spokesperson said: ""Our furlough scheme has protected nearly nine million jobs. It's been extended until October - meaning it will have been open for eight months and those self-isolating can continue to access the scheme. We're continuing to work hard to ensure those self-isolating get the support they need, including making statutory sick pay payable from day one, and we've injected more than £6.5bn into the welfare safety net.""",Newspaper

In my opinion they apply to all.""His comments are the clearest sign of disquiet among experts over Mr Cummings' actions, which sparked an outpouring of anger from the public, opposition MPs and even senior Conservatives.Durham Police said Mr Cummings' may have breached the rules with a separate drive he made to Barnard Castle while staying in the area but concluded that no further action would be taken.Asked about Mr Cummings, culture secretary Oliver Dowden said: ""Dominic Cummings gave a very extensive explanation of his behaviour on Monday and answered all questions in relation to that.""The prime minister accepted that explanation and on that basis kept him in post and that remains the position.""Earlier, one scientist said the ""Cummings affair"" could impact trust in the authorities issuing the rules.Professor Robert West, a member of the behavioural scientists subgroup which advises the government, said: ""Trust in authority telling you to do things is very important when it comes to people adhering to those rules.""This is going to become even more important as we move to a situation where it's not everybody having to do it, it's people who have drawn the short straw.""​He said that ""when people see something like the Cummings affair... that's not a recipe for trust.""Elsewhere, it emerged that former prime minister Theresa May had told her constituents that Mr Cummings had failed to comply with the ""spirit"" of the rules.In a message, seen by The Mirror, Ms May said: ""What this matter has shown is that there was a discrepancy between the simple messages given by the government and the details of the legislation passed by Parliament.""In these circumstances I do not feel that Mr Cummings followed the spirit of the guidance.""I can well understand the anger of those who have been abiding by the spirit of the guidance given by the government and expect others to do so.""",Newspaper; Web Publication

'Contrary to this fear, we found that overall loneliness did not increase. Instead, people felt more supported by others than before the pandemic. 'Even while physically isolated, the feeling of increased social support and of being in this together may help limit increases in loneliness.' Loneliness has been associated with a number of health problems. It can affect mood disorders and trigger depression, but it has also been linked to heart disease, higher blood pressure, immunity function, and nervous system disorders.A 2015 review study showed that both actual and perceived social isolation increased our chances of dying early by 26 percent.In the UK and the US, approximately one in three people older than 65 live alone, and in the US, half of those older than 85 live alone.In both countries, studies show that loneliness in people older than 60 can reach as high as 46 percent. Because the 'baby boomer' population is larger than any other, by the year 2030, the majority of Americans will be 70 and older. For the study, published in the journal American Psychologists, the team surveyed more than 2,000 adults between ages 18 and 98.First, participants filled out a questionnaire in February unrelated to COVID-19, before the disease was considered a threat.Then, in March, the adults filled out two more, one in mid-March during the White House's 15 days to slow the spread guidelines and another one in late April, when the guidelines were set to end. Researchers looked at how levels of loneliness impacted at-risk groups, such as the elderly.Older adults had a slight increase in feelings of loneliness in mid-March although it leveled off after stay-at-home orders were enacted.Those living alone, or with one pre-existing condition, had more feelings of loneliness at the beginning of the pandemic, but it did not increase when social distancing guidelines were introduced. 'Despite a small increase among some individuals, we found overall remarkable resilience in response to COVID-19,' said senior author Dr Angelina Sutin, an associate professor of Behavioral Sciences and Social Medicine.However, the researchers found several anecdotal reports of people calling their family and friends more often during the pandemic. The team believes that having a strong social support network helped prevent people from having increased feelings of loneliness.'Just knowing that you are not alone and that everyone is going through the same restrictions and difficulties may be enough in the short term to keep feelings of loneliness down,' Sutin said.",Web Publication

Prof Reicher told ITV's Good Morning Britain: ""The reason why people observed lockdown was not for themselves, it wasn't because they were personally at risk. They did it for the community; because of a sense of 'we're all in this together'.

145,Calderwood 'not qualified' to deal with the pandemic,"June 12, 2020 Friday",International,The Times (London),603,603,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,,Calderwood 'not qualified' to deal with the pandemic,"Scotland's ill-fated chief medical officer and her successor were unqualified for the role of protecting the country from a pandemic, a senior public health expert has claimed (Marc Horne writes).Catherine Calderwood, a consultant obstetrician and gynaecologist, was forced to resign from the role in April after she broke her own lockdown advice and spent two weekends at her second home. She was replaced by Gregor Smith, a GP and primary care director for NHS Lanarkshire.Last week it emerged that a 2018 simulation of a coronavirus outbreak in Scotland called Exercise Iris found there was a ""clear gap"" in preparations.It concluded there was ""unease"" among frontline staff over a lack of clarity on PPE supplies, training and testing, two years before the country faced the largest health emergency of modern times. Gabriel Scally, president of the epidemiology and public health section of the Royal Society of Medicine, claimed neither had the experience or training to deal with a major public health emergency.""Catherine Calderwood was an obstetrician,"" he said. ""No one in their right mind would put a public health physician in charge of a major maternity hospital. I wouldn't expect an obstetrician to be put in charge of a major public health programme. Her interim successor is a GP. It is a clear mismatch of skills.""He added: ""When the UK went into this crisis only one of the four chief medical officers of the four countries was from a public health background; Frank Atherton in Wales. I don't see how you can go into such an enormous public health crisis when you have appointed someone who is not a public health physician to the most important public health position in the country.""The chief medical officer posts in the UK and Ireland have traditionally been occupied by public health physicians because they are the people who are trained to do the job of looking after the population's health. It is worrying that these hugely important roles are occupied by people who don't have the qualifications and training.""Dr Calderwood apologised after she twice travelled to her second home in Earlsferry, Fife, 45 miles from Edinburgh, where she usually lives. Her replacement, Dr Smith, had been her deputy since 2015.Dr Scally, visiting professor of public health at the University of Bristol, claimed a lack of specialist expert advice had cost lives and prolonged the spread of the pandemic.""People without a public health background don't have the experience and the skill set to be able to handle major crises,"" he said. ""The consequences of this have been very serious indeed.""To my mind it is why the UK has done so badly.""There is no doubt in my mind that a series of things weren't done properly.""He added: ""How much stronger would the response have been if there were four public health physicians as the four UK chief medical officers? ""I can tell you it would have been much more robust, effective and timely.""A Scottish government spokesman said the chief medical officer role was a ""wide-ranging"" one.""Early in this crisis, the Scottish government established the Covid-19 advisory group to provide an additional level of expert and scientific advice spanning the disciplines of public health, clinical advice, epidemiology, virology, behavioural sciences, global health, medicine and statistical modelling in a Scottish context,"" he said. ""This group reports to the chief medical officer and Scottish ministers on a regular basis to ensure the Scottish government's actions are guided by the best and most up to date expert scientific and medical advice.

The rest of us follow them;The No 10 adviser's actions epitomise his data-worshiping philosophy of exceptionalismCoronavirus - latest updatesSee all our coronavirus coverage","May 27, 2020 Wednesday",International,The Guardian (London),1108,1108,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,Alan Finlayson,"In Cummings' mind, clever people break the rules. The rest of us follow themThe No 10 adviser's actions epitomise his data-worshiping philosophy of exceptionalismCoronavirus - latest updatesSee all our coronavirus coverage","What planet are they on? It's a good question, one we might ask of any government at any time. But it feels particularly appropriate for Dominic Cummings and the government he advises, which seems to think the rules it makes for the rest of us don't apply to its members. The chief aide's recent decision to flout the lockdown is a case in point: he exists on a different planet to ours, where he abides by a different set of rules.Political philosophies encompass beliefs about just a few things: equality, liberty, authority and so on. Like musical notes, this small number of ideas can be assembled in all sorts of ways. The keynotes of Conservatism are order and inequality. The song they make is about how, when everyone remains in their rightful place in the hierarchy, things are stable, harmonious and good. But the song can dramatically shift into a minor key: some bad people have messed things up; they have put things in the wrong order; we have to get rid of them and make everything great again.Who these bad people are depends on the moment in question. Today it's those who work with words, ideas and rules: the ""politically correct"" journalists, academics and writers foisting their opinions on society; the lawyers and judges subverting the peoples' will ; the government bureaucrats working in ""the deep state"". Disgust at such people is one of the major forces in politics, uniting flat-earth fanatics with those who think climate change is overstated, that feminism and antiracism have gone ""too far"", or that government is a scam to redirect your taxes to undeserving foreigners.Johnson has often made noise about ""reforming"" the civil service, neutering the power of judges, starving the BBC and cracking down on humanities graduates. Some of this was a political tactic for building a new electoral coalition. But Cummings' hostility to those he caricatures as "" People in SW1 ... babbling about gender identity diversity "" is real. Conservatism is in part a rejection of abstract ideas such as human rights, equality and the European Union, in favour of more concrete things such as family, home and England: that's why a ""citizen of the world"" is a ""citizen of nowhere"". For a long time, Conservatives countered abstraction with celebrations of custom, habit and tradition. More recently, they contrasted it with the ""natural"" and ""spontaneous"" order of the market. Today, at least in Cummings' world, abstract thinking must give way to The Data.The Data - analysed by behavioural economists and evolutionary psychologists -  has confirmed what Conservatives always thought: human nature is flawed. We all try to be rational but nature overrules us. People succumb to ""groupthink"" and primal ""chimp politics"". But salvation is at hand. With the help of computation, statistics and modelling, we have the information about social and natural systems, and the capacity to understand their laws. We can't make things perfect, but we can identify risks and manage threats: an asteroid collision, an economic crisis or, indeed, a pandemic. In this way, the traditional Conservative belief in providence is transformed into faith in artificial intelligence.But - and this is the key thing - not everyone can make sense of the message conveyed by advanced systems such as big data and AI. In Cummings' view, the greatest fault of those who ""chat about Lacan at dinner parties"" is their interest in words, interpretation and critique, when they ought to be learning about numbers, probabilities and prediction. The heroes of his political philosophy are the ""super-forecasters"" and the engineers able to divine meaning in The Data. It follows that the best kind of government is the one designed to find those ""misfits and weirdos"", lure them off Reddit and make them over into anti-philosopher kings. In the shadow of The Data, the innumerate fools in parliament, the press and academia have nothing of value to add.From this worldview it's natural for Cummings to think that the rules he has helped to make don't apply to him. His actions aren't hypocritical - they're entirely consistent with his conservative philosophy. Conservatism has always been, at root, a defence of inequality. It aims to separate the best from the rest and ensure that the best are on top. The line dividing sheep from goats can be drawn in many places: between older and younger, entrepreneurs and wage-earners, hardworking families and idle benefits cheats, natives and foreigners.Cummings draws this line between his kind of clever people who understand the world and the rest of us who are just guessing. And because of our herding behaviour and suboptimal decision-making, we the people are why Cummings thinks that people like him need to be in government. Through The Data, government can know us intimately. It can know exactly what we want, thanks to the information we freely give away online. And it can communicate back to us - unhindered by biased reporters. '""We're particularly interested in deep experts on TV and digital,"" said Cummings when advertising for new advisers, ""people who have worked in movies or on advertising campaigns. There are some very interesting possibilities in the intersection of technology and storytelling."" The priests of The Data will work out what needs to be done, what we need to be told, and how we should be told it. Then we will do what The Data dictates.Does Cummings think he is better than the rest of us? Of course he does. Elites never believe the rules they have divined apply to themselves. We who aren't gifted must do what The Data says. But those who lead us - people like Cummings - have to make the hard calls and decide who to sacrifice in the battle to protect us from our own imperfections. Naturally, people like that can measure their own risks and, as he insisted in his press conference, exercise their own judgment. Those who make the rules cannot be bound by them, especially in what they can declare an ""exceptional situation"". We shouldn't be so crass as to criticise them or, worst of all, ""politicise"" what they do.It is likely that we have at least four more years of this government. If Cummings remains in post, I want to see how his experiment plays out. I want to see what, in the end, The Data tells us. Will it show that he was its true prophet? Or will it confirm that he is just like the rest of us: vain, rash, a herd animal - another humanities graduate playing instinctive ""chimp politics""? My intuition is that you don't need to be a super-forecaster to make a good guess. Alan Finlayson is professor of political and social theory at the University of East Anglia",Newspaper

Sir Ian, professor of biology at St Andrews University, urged ministers to stop saying they were led by science as it was ""slightly misleading"". He told the BBC's Coronavirus Newscast that what scientists do is ""give the best advice we can based on the evidence that's available to us. We then pass it to government ministers and the policy parts of government who can then take that and do with it what they like.""Sir Ian said that Britain was ""a bit slower off the mark"" than Asian countries that had been hit by Sars in the early 2000s and erred in assuming this virus would be no more infectious.""Acting very early was really important and I would have loved to have seen us acting a week or two weeks earlier and it would have made quite a big difference to the steepness of the curve of infection and therefore the death rate. And I think that's really the No 1 issue.""Although Sir Ian was not in Sage discussions in March, he said: ""You could point the finger at scientists for not being explicit enough. But at the end of the day all these interact with public opinion as well. And I think some politicians would have loved to have reacted earlier but in their political opinion it probably wasn't feasible because people wouldn't have perhaps responded in the way they eventually did.""In March some epidemiologists privately expressed frustration over behavioural scientists advising the government to lockdown later over fears people would tire of restrictions.Sir Paul Nurse, head of the Francis Crick Institute, said ""everybody"" had made mistakes. ""I get a sense the UK has been rather too much on the back foot, increasingly playing catch-up, firefighting through successive crises."" He now urged ""a much clearer publicly presented strategy as to what we're actually trying to do, and the evidence upon which it is based"".Speaking on Today on BBC Radio 4, he said: ""Maybe there's a strategy there, I don't see it."" Referring to who is in charge of strategy, he said: ""Is it ministers? Is it Public Health England? The National Health Service? The Office for Life Sciences? I don't know, but more importantly, do they know?"" While some in Downing Street have vented frustration at Public Health England (PHE), the agency responded yesterday through John Newton, who is also the government's testing coordinator. He told MPs that strategy for testing was the responsibility of the Department of Health and Social Care.Pressed on a key decision in mid-March to stop contact tracing, Professor Newton said this had been made by the government, not PHE. However, he said of modelling at the time: ""If you have a million cases, there is no way, however much contact tracing or testing capacity you have, you could pursue the South Korean model.""Professor Newton argued that South Korea's job was much easier because at one point 55 per cent of cases were linked to a single religious group.",Newspaper

On the upside, the documents show Sage moved rapidly to catch up. Crucially, it was able to change tack and assert the case for lockdown in the face of considerable political pressure. Jan 22: First ""precautionary"" meeting Sage convenes 22 days after news of the Wuhan outbreak was first reported by China. The Department of Health and Social Care provides an update on China, warning ""diagnostic testing capacity in Wuhan is overwhelmed"". There is evidence of human-to-human transmission but it is not known if it is sustainable. The meeting considers the UK's readiness for a pandemic and is told: ""The UK currently has good centralised diagnostic capacity - and is days away from a specific test, which is scalable across the UK in a few weeks."" February 2020: The build up If the first meeting was calm, the rest were not. From the second meeting, Jan 28, the group is on a war footing. The DHSC notes half of all new cases in China are occurring outside Wuhan and there is evidence of ""sustained human-to-human"" transmission. Control in UK ""healthcare settings"", ""rapid detection of cases"" and ""selfisolation"" will be required, says Sage. But the UK's testing capacity is still not ready: A ""specific test should be ready by the end of the week, with the capacity to run 400 to 500 tests a day"", the minutes note. Sage adopts a ""reasonable worst case scenario"". This is taken from the existing UK Pandemic Influenza Strategy, which says that 600,000 would die.The next meeting, Feb 3, focuses on possible travel restrictions. Modelling shows only by restricting 95 per cent of flights can the epidemic be delayed by a month. But ""a month of additional preparation time for the NHS would be meaningful"", it notes.The next day the group meets again and is frustrated with the lack of data from China and Asia. ""Greater sharing of data is essential"", it says. The Foreign Office is asked to work with DHSC to ""ensure the message from the UK is coordinated. This is only mention of the Foreign Office - a future inquiry will almost certainly consider if the UK's overseas intelligence gathering could have been better.Feb 25: First mention of lockdown Modelling by the London School and mounting evidence from overseas appear to have convinced Sage that radical intervention measures are needed. Here it seems to break with the gentle ""mitigation"" approach of the old pandemic influenza strategy and embrace Asian-style lockdown tactics.Sage discussed non-pharmaceutical interventions for university and school closures; home isolation; household quarantine; and social distancing.""All require implementation for a significant duration to be effective."" Evidence indicates these measures ""can reduce Covid-19 reproduction number to approximately one"". Reduced spread in the UK through a combination of these measures was assessed to be realistic, it says.March 2020: The March crisis It would be another month before Britain tuned in to watch Boris Johnson's address to the nation to announce lockdown as the only means of dealing with the ""invisible killer"".But in a sure sign No10 was waking up to the threat posed by Covid-19 and the lockdown proposals of Sage, Dominic Cummings attended his first meeting on March 5. Minutes suggest the scientists were cautious about repercussions of a lockdown strategy, fearing it could create a second wave and cause indirect harms.But time was running out. PHE's surveillance had not worked. By March 10, the committee noted there were 5,000-10,000 cases already in the UK. Yet at a time most countries worldwide were locking down - Italy was already closed and Spain would follow a few days later - the UK was stalling.Discussion shifted to the idea of locking down or ""shielding"" only the most vulnerable - a compromise.A document from Sage's behavioural science committee suggests one way to sugar coat this for the vulnerable was to suggest the rest of the population would be acquiring ""herd immunity"" to protect them. This is not mentioned in the minutes of the main Sage body, and the Government insists it was never official policy, but it became front page news. It was briefed, perhaps with No10's consent, to the media on March 11, the day before the next and crucial Cobra meeting.By March 16, the tone on Sage had changed dramatically. There were now as many as 10,000 new infections every day, and it was doubling every five or six days. Herd immunity coverage was generating anger and panic in the population. At the meeting Sage agreed to go public. ""It is important to demonstrate the uncertainties scientists have faced… and the science behind the advice at each stage,"" the minutes note. Later Prof Ferguson's team published a report suggesting 500,000 could die without interventions.Though the Government continued to grapple with a final decision on lockdown for another week, the public reaction to the Imperial paper was overwhelming and ultimately forced Mr Johnson's hand.",Newspaper

Where once baristastaffed coffee bars and children's play areas were among the perks designed to ""sell the sizzle"" and tempt customers to make the second-biggest purchase of their lives, now hygiene has become the key feature.""There's a health crisis and there will be an economic crisis,"" said Alison Jones, UK managing director of Peugeot, Citroën and DS. ""We need to get the economy moving. Health is the main priority - but we've found a way to work safely.""The car industry is just one of many retail sectors now wrestling with a crucial question: they might be ready to reopen, but how do they flip consumers' psychological switches and persuade them to open their wallets again? The lockdown and social distancing have brought household spending - which makes up 60% of economic output - to a juddering halt. As shops, cinemas, car dealerships, pubs and restaurants pulled down the shutters, so too did consumers. Data from Visa shows household spending is down by about 30%. The housing market is on hold, with listings and sales down more than 80%, according to Zoopla. Car sales crashed 97% last month, according to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders. Savings are rising as households squirrel away cash.Last week, the Bank of England laid bare the devastation this will wreak on the economy. The UK is braced for the worst recession in 300 years, it warned, with output crashing as much as 30% in the first half of the year and two million people set to lose their jobs. Even when the lockdown is eased, a ""degree of precautionary behaviour by households and businesses is assumed to persist"", it said.Coaxing consumers out of hibernation is one of the most vexing issues facing the economy. It will help define what shape the recovery takes: whether there is a sudden, sharp bounceback in the second half of the year, creating a V-shaped graph, or whether a self-perpetuating cycle of grim economic news results in a slow, attritional U-shaped trudge out.The starting point is bleak. The government's ""Stay at home, protect the NHS, save lives"" slogan helped prevent hospitals from becoming overwhelmed, but in the weeks of lockdown it has also sown a deep-rooted fear of normal activities.Shaking hands is an inconceivable faux pas. Shoppers instinctively give each other a wide berth in the aisles at Tesco. Footage of crowded pubs and trains from before lockdown looks alien. Persuading people that going out can be safe will require significant mental rewiring.""People adjust very quickly to new ways of life,"" said George Buckley, chief UK economist at Nomura. ""It's going to be very difficult to get people back into parts of the economy where social distancing needs to be actively used.""There will be a worry factor about going into pubs and using public transport. If you don't need to do it, why would you do it? It's going to take a long time for people to go back into restaurants and theatres - not from the supply side but from the demand side.""A recent survey by Ipsos Mori showed that more than 60% of people would be uncomfortable returning to bars and restaurants, using public transport or going to a large event. ""People [in the West] tend to overreact and overestimate the fatality and infection rates,"" said Michele Belot, a behavioural economist at the European University Institute in Italy. Its research shows Britons believe that 23% of people in their local area are, or have been, infected with Covid-19, versus 14% in South Korea. The actual rate in both countries is thought to be much lower.Professor David Spiegelhalter, a statistician at Cambridge University, told the BBC last week: ""We do need to have some sort of campaign to encourage people who are very low-risk to get out and start living again, when we are able to.""But living - and spending - will look very different. At car dealerships, customers who brave the trip will sit at least two metres away from the salesperson, possibly separated by a sheet of Perspex and wearing facemasks. Andy Barratt, managing director of Ford in Britain, said it would make any car sale ""a sanitised, mechanical process"".He added: ""You've got to work out how to get the emotion, and that may be selling the sizzle through video. You want to build rapport, trust and loyalty.""Test drives will be either done alone, guided by an app, or with the salesperson sitting in the back-left seat. Peugeot and Vauxhall dealerships will insist on a three-hour gap between test drives of each car to allow for deep cleaning.Forms will be signed electronically.Customers who do not want to enter a branch will be given virtual tours of vehicles, and cars will be delivered to their homes. ""Radical progression comes in the face of adversity,"" said Barratt. ""The dealers have digitised much more quickly. The market has to come back.""A similar story of sanitised selling is taking shape in sectors from fashion to hotels. The coronavirus has left the world awash with unsold clothes. Retailers will have to shift stockpiled spring/summerwear as quickly as possible - but with so many brands on sale, discounting will lose its power, while social distancing will result in a struggle to handle surges in demand at stores or warehouses around the time of Black Friday and Christmas.InterContinental Hotels Group, owner of Holiday Inn, plans to put cleaning kits in rooms, install screens at check-in desks and visibly sanitise communal areas.""We are going to highlight what we do and make sure there are visible cues throughout the hotel,"" said chief executive Keith Barr. ""We're going to look at the customer journey, including the future of buffets. Will they still exist?"" All that extra friction will increase the likelihood that consumers are put off buying things they do not need. That will be a big problem for all retailers of ""discretionary"" - non-urgent - goods. ""You need to re-convince people of the importance of things they've forgotten about,"" said Roger Parry, chairman of polling company YouGov. ""That third flavour of yoghurt they haven't bought in a while: it's reminding people they get pleasure from unnecessary things.""But hopes of a recovery in spending are set against a troubling backdrop. A rising tide of job losses, such as 18,000 announced at Virgin Atlantic, British Airways and Ryanair in the past fortnight, coupled with stagnant wages, is likely to further depress sentiment. Hours will be cut. Google Trends data shows searches for ""redundancy"" and ""mortgage holiday"" have spiked in recent weeks.Those who have not been furloughed or lost their jobs have become forced or willing savers. Simon French at Panmure Gordon said that during times of unemployment, precautionary savings rise. He calculates there are more than 55.5 million consumers in the UK. Of those, seven million have ""cyclical"" jobs in industries such as manufacturing, whose fortunes rise and fall with the wider economy - and are particularly sensitive to economic sentiment. ""They are the bellwether that will determine whether this is a V-shaped recovery in terms of consumer spending or much more of a U-shaped recovery,"" said French.Swathes of households face financial difficulty, especially as mortgage holidays, the furlough scheme and other payment breaks come to an end next month. Capital Economics estimates that two million mortgage holidays have been granted, while claims for universal credit have rocketed. Debt charity StepChange warned that the self-employed and sole traders, who last struggled during the financial crisis, were also at risk of being dragged into difficulty.All that will heap pressure on ministers and the Bank to do more to stimulate the economy via measures such as VAT cuts, a stamp duty holiday and quantitative easing. Car firms want a scrappage scheme and state-funded discounts to get consumers to buy new, low-emission models. Former Tesco boss Sir Terry Leahy called for regulations to be slashed to free up business investment. ""Take housing,"" Leahy said. ""If you were able to build 300,000 homes rather than 100,000, that greatly increases the supply, houses become more affordable, and those house moves make a big difference in terms of consumer spending.""If there is to be a recovery, it must be supported by clear and reassuring messages about safety from the government, said Belot. Countries such as China and South Korea have been able to lift their lockdowns in part because previous epidemics, such as Sars, meant that they already had systems to handle the crisis.""Everything has to do with reassuring people there are public safety measures in place,"" said Belot. ""What is troubling for people is that they do not really see how the year ahead will go. Uncertainty is very bad for consumption and investment. Some countries are more successful than others when it comes to reassurance about a long-term plan. When I talk to people in Asia, they are a lot less worried, because there are protocols in place to respond to possible new outbreaks.""Here, I am not really sure that people are reassured about the way the crisis has been handled.""",Newspaper

For comparison, 160 fatalities were announced last Monday and 118 were recorded yesterday. But officials warn that death numbers released on Sundays and Mondays are usually significantly smaller due to a delay in processing fatalities over the weekend. Department of Health chiefs also announced 1,625 more Covid-19 cases today, the first time the UK has recorded fewer than 2,000 positive tests in the space of 24 hours in almost nine weeks. Separate figures showed 8,800 Brits are currently in hospital being treated for coronavirus - down 12 per cent in a week.In another dramatic day in Britain's coronavirus crisis, Boris Johnson revealed outdoor markets and car showrooms can reopen from June 1 if they meet Covid-19 safety guidelines. He added that all other non-essential shops, such as clothes stores and book shops, will be expected to be able to reopen a fortnight later on June 15.The Prime Minister's announcement in the Downing Street press conference tonight came after his aide Dominic Cummings refused to apologise for driving 260 miles to Durham during the coronavirus lockdown.

CUMMINGS REFUSES TO APOLOGISE FOR DRIVING TO DURHAM DURING CORONAVIRUS LOCKDOWN                     Dominic Cummings today refused to apologise for driving 260 miles to Durham during the coronavirus lockdown as he claimed he had always behaved 'reasonably and legally' amid growing calls for the PM's top aide to be sacked.Mr Cummings said his decision to travel to the city to stay in a cottage on his parents' land was the result of a 'very complicated, tricky situation' as he admitted he had not sought Boris Johnson's permission to make the journey at the end of March.The Vote Leave maverick has faced accusations of 'double standards', with the nation having been told to stay at home, but he told an unprecedented press conference in the Number 10 Rose Garden: 'I don't regret what I did... I think what I did was reasonable in the circumstances.'Asked directly if he had offered to quit or had even considered it, he added: 'No I have not offered to resign, no I have not considered it.' Mr Cummings conceded that 'reasonable people may well disagree' with his chosen course of action but he was resolute in his belief that he had acted in an appropriate manner and had not broken the rules.He insisted 'I don't think there is one rule for me and one rule for other people' and blamed public anger at media reports 'that have not been true'.The usually scruffy adviser was wearing an open collared shirt as he confirmed that he had travelled to the town of Barnard Castle on April 12 after the end of his period in self-isolation with coronavirus.He insisted he and his family had not walked around the town 30 miles from Durham and had only ventured 15 metres from the car to the river bank. He said the purpose of the journey was to see if he was fit enough to make the drive back to London.He also said that he and his family had walked around a woods during their stay in Durham but that they were within his parents' private property and that they had not come into contact with anyone else.Meanwhile, he claimed he did not stop for fuel on the way up to Durham but he had stopped once on the way back.He said: 'Yesterday I gave a full account to the Prime Minister of my actions between March 27 and April 14, what I thought and did.The Department of Health's daily death toll means the rolling seven-day average of victims has dropped to just 303 - the lowest since March 31 (274) and less than a third of the peak on April 14 (943). It takes the overall official number of victims to 36,914 - but the true number is thousands higher because it only takes into account laboratory-confirmed cases, not the suspected deaths in other settings. Of the 121 new deaths, 76 occurred in hospitals - most of which were in England. The remainder of the newly recorded Covid-19 fatalities happened in other settings, such as care homes. England recorded 104 deaths, followed by nine in Scotland, seven in Wales and one in Northern Ireland - tallies that do not match up with the individual counts recorded by each of the home nations.For instance, Scotland's own health chiefs today announced three new deaths but yesterday recorded seven. Northern Ireland had the same issue, recording eight new fatalities today but only one yesterday. The issue is only thought to occur with Scotland and Northern Ireland because of a difference in how the data is collected. Wales announced seven new deaths today and yesterday.NHS England figures also do not match the individual tally collated by the Department of Health for England (104) because the official toll includes deaths across all settings, not just in hospitals.And the two use different measures for hospital deaths, with the DH relying on data from Public Health England, which uses several sources to provide an update every afternoon.The figures published today by NHS England confirm that April 8 was still the peak of the crisis, with 891 hospital deaths recorded - up from the 59 that were announced today by NHS England. Of the 59 new deaths recorded in England's hospitals, 47 occurred over the weekend. Five took place on Friday, while the remaining seven victims succumbed to the disease between May 16 and 21. It comes as Dominic Cummings will this afternoon make a public statement to directly address claims he broke lockdown rules by travelling to Durham, Downing Street confirmed. Mr Cummings is expected to take questions about his conduct which has plunged the government into a state of crisis and has prompted calls for a formal investigation. The intervention came after one of the government's scientific advisers warned the 'debacle' over the lockdown journey had 'fatally undermined' the nation's fight against coronavirus.Professor Stephen Reicher, who is a member of the Government's advisory group on behavioural science which feeds into SAGE, said the result of 'undermining adherence to the rules' will be that 'more people are going to die'. Mr Johnson is facing a furious backlash from ministers, Tory MPs and even bishops after he yesterday attempted to mount an extraordinary defence of Mr Cummings, staking his reputation on trying to protect his aide. At a dramatic Downing Street press conference last night, the PM claimed Mr Cummings had acted 'responsibly, legally and with integrity' while making a controversial 260-mile trip from London to Durham during lockdown.Mr Johnson insisted Mr Cummings had 'followed the instincts of every father' by driving to his parents' farm after his wife developed symptoms of coronavirus. The PM's defence of his aide prompted fury among Britons. Sun-worshippers descended on parks and beaches today for the Bank Holiday amid an expected 79F heatwave, which could see parts of the country basked in temperatures hotter than Athens, Nice and Barcelona. Crowds formed outside the Serpentine in London's Hyde Park, as beaches in Sussex, Essex and Dorset quickly filled up with visitors looking to enjoy the dry and sunny conditions forecast to last the whole day.                     Dominic Cummings: The acerbic 'career psychopath' and Brexit mastermind not afraid to speak his mind - or make enemies                     Few supposedly backroom political operators have found themselves in the limelight as often as Dominic Cummings, the quiet yet acerbic mastermind credited with winning the Brexit referendum.Once just one of dozens of special advisors working for the Tories he leapt into the limelight by overseeing the Vote Leave operation which helped win the 2016 vote.But it is the machinations in Downing Street during the 48-year-old's 10 months working for Boris Johnson that has created a dramatis personae rarely seen in British politics.Allies see him as a boot-tough, anti-establishment consigliere to the PM, on a mission to shake up politics and the civil service after years of stagnation.Enemies - which he appears to make in droves - appear to regard him as a hardline Brexiteer puppet-master akin to a modern-day Rasputin.Much of this image appears to have been happily built up by the 'career psychopath' - a moniker given to him by David Cameron.His time in No10 has seen him clash widely as he cemented a power base that culminated this week in the Prime Minister refusing to sack him for breaking lockdown despite the clamour from the public, press and his own MPs.He has turfed out long-serving ministers and staff to create a No10 wheel that has him at its hub.More recently he has clashed with top civil servants including Cabinet Secretary Mark Sedwill in his quest to revolutionise Whitehall and was seen as the man responsible for ousting Sajid Javid as chancellor in February.People in England are now allowed to travel for day trips but must stay at least six feet away from people who are not from their household, something that could be impossible in crowded areas.In other developments today, an NHS hospital in the Somerset seaside hotspot of Weston-super-Mare was forced to stop taking new patients due to 'a high number' of coronavirus cases.Weston General Hospital dramatically announced this morning it could not take any more admissions, including into A&E.Health chiefs do not know why the hospital has had an influx of Covid-19 cases, with bosses warning all hospitals have 'frequent' changes in admissions.But questions were today asked over whether the blame may lie on crowds who have flocked to the town to enjoy the sun since lockdown was slightly eased.Thousands of people travelled to the South West and other coastal areas as soon as the government allowed nationwide travel again on May 13.Weston-super-Mare's mayor even admitted 'you can't rule it out', when questioned if scores of Britons on the beach were to blame for the surge in cases. It is not the first time hospitals have been overwhelmed amid the coronavirus crisis, which began to spiral out of control in mid-March.One NHS hospital in London was forced to declare a 'critical incident' early on in the crisis, after running out of intensive care beds. Other hospitals in the capital have allegedly had to turn away coronavirus patients because they were running out of beds, according to staff.Education Secretary Gavin Williamson today admitted that schools face a 'long journey' before they are able to return to normal, and he insisted classes must restart on June 1 for the mental health of children.He acknowledged there would be 'initial nervousness' from parents about releasing their children from the months' long shutdown. But he said that on top of missing classes they were also missing 'social interaction' with their friends.His emotional pitch to parents came after Boris Johnson has suggested non-essential shops could soon reopen and family 'bubbles' be extended in a further easing of lockdown measures this week.Draconian measures put in place on March 23 to limit the spread of coronavirus were relaxed two weeks ago to allow households to meet one person from another in an outdoor space, so long as they remain two metres apart.                      NHS HOSPITAL IN WESTON-SUPER-MARE SHUTS A&E AND STOPS TAKING NEW PATIENTS                    An NHS hospital in the Somerset seaside hotspot of Weston-super-Mare was today forced to stop taking new patients due to 'a high number' of coronavirus cases.Weston General Hospital dramatically announced this morning that it could not take any more admissions, including into A&E.Health chiefs do not know why the hospital has had an influx of Covid-19 cases, with bosses warning all hospitals have 'frequent' changes in admissions.But questions were today asked over whether the blame may lie on crowds who have flocked to the town to enjoy the sun since lockdown was slightly eased.

Furious Brits warned VE day celebrations on the beach on May 8 were 'coming home to roost', and one warned a second wave 'rolling' into the South West. It is not the first time hospitals have been overwhelmed amid the coronavirus crisis, which began to spiral out of control in mid-March.One NHS hospital in London was forced to declare a 'critical incident' early on in the crisis, after running out of intensive care beds. Other hospitals in the capital have allegedly had to turn away coronavirus patients because they were running out of beds, according to staff.Britons were also permitted to partake in unlimited exercise, use outdoor sports courts and facilities and visit garden centres while pubs, restaurants and bars stay shut.But the Prime Minister last night suggested measures could be eased again, after he claimed in the daily Downing Street news conference Britain was 'in a position to move to Step two' of his roadmap to recovery.Mr Williamson repeated the Government's mantra of creating a 'protective bubble' around returning pupils when he appeared on BBC Breakfast.He added: 'Without the benefit of going to school they are really missing out, not just educationally. I'm sure we have seen it with our own children, they have spent so much time away from children of their own age, having those elements of social interaction.'There are almost 260,000 positive test results of COVID-19 so far. But there are bound to be millions more Britons who have had the virus but never been tested.Doctors warned today spread of the virus in hospitals may be fuelled by high 'false negative' test results.Three in 10 negative coronavirus tests may be wrong, The Hospital Consultants and Specialists Association (HCSA) has said, which means between two and three people who have Covid-19 may test negative. This is dangerous because it means the patients may go outside and spread the virus to others, under the belief they are free of the infection, and hospital staff may return to work thinking they are virus-free. The HCSA, which represents thousands of frontline medics, said there is a 'shroud of secrecy' over how accurate the swab tests are and called for an end to the 'wall of silence' on testing accuracy from Public Health England (PHE).PHE has never disclosed how accurate its antigen testing is, despite publishing public papers on the accuracy of antibody tests.In a letter to Duncan Selbie, the chief executive of PHE, Dr Paul Donaldson, general secretary of the HCSA, expressed his 'deep concern and frustration' at the 'systematic lack of information' over the reliability its tests.He said: 'A wall of silence seems to have been erected around the issue, with only the occasional claim or hint emerging regarding the testing regime. 'Separately, statements by PHE officials and others place the incidence of false negatives somewhere between 20 and 30 per cent.                     IT WILL BE A 'LONG JOURNEY' TO GET SCHOOLS BACK TO NORMAL, SAYS GAVIN WILLIAMSON                    Schools face a 'long journey' before they are able to return to normal, Gavin Williamson admitted today as he insisted classes must restart on June 1 for the mental health of children.The Education Secretary acknowledged that there would be 'initial nervousness' from parents about releasing their children from the months' long shutdown.But he said that on top of missing classes they were also missing 'social interaction' with their friends. His emotional pitch to parents came after Boris Johnson has suggested non-essential shops could soon reopen and family 'bubbles' be extended in a further easing of lockdown measures this week. Mr Williamson repeated the Government's mantra of creating a 'protective bubble' around returning pupils when he appeared on BBC Breakfast.He added: 'Without the benefit of going to school they are really missing out, not just educationally.'I'm sure we have seen it with our own children, they have spent so much time away from children of their own age, having those elements of social interaction.He added: 'I have seen it in my own children, how much they are missing out. We can't be in a situation where we just go months and months where children are just going to be missing out on education.'Coronavirus could be with us a year or more. If we don't get them back, how much they fall behind will be tragic and we have got to take these first cautious, tentative steps.' Draconian measures put in place on March 23 to limit the spread of coronavirus were relaxed two weeks ago to allow households to meet one person from another in an outdoor space, so long as they remain two metres apart.Britons were also permitted to partake in unlimited exercise, use outdoor sports courts and facilities and visit garden centres while pubs, restaurants and bars stay shut.But the Prime Minister last night suggested measures could be eased again, after he claimed in the daily Downing Street news conference Britain was 'in a position to move to Step 2' of his roadmap to recovery.'If confirmed, this is a worryingly high rate that raises the prospect of many infected individuals, possibly without symptoms, being passed fit to return to healthcare settings where they will transmit Sars-CoV-2 to colleagues and patients. 'If the chance of false negative results is as high as reported then in our view, without repeat PCR testing to confirm a negative result, staff should not be told to return to a clinical setting where they would risk passing SARS-CoV-2 to vulnerable patients and fellow staff. 'This could become a particularly acute issue as the NHS plans to significantly increase its non-Covid work and wider lockdown measures are eased.' Prime Minister Boris Johnson has warned hospital acquired COVID-19 has caused an 'epidemic' of deaths during the pandemic. NHS bosses say up to a fifth of Covid-19 patients in several hospitals have contracted the disease while already being treated there for another illness. PHE uses polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests, which are a form of antigen tests conducted to see if someone has the virus, SARS-CoV-2, at any given time. These viral RNA tests use samples taken from a suspected patient's throat, mouth or nose with a swab.The accuracy of viral RNA swabs depends almost entirely on the quality of sampling and when the sample is taken in the course of disease, which will vary greatly, experts say.Research by the University of Bristol found between two per cent and 29 per cent of COVID-19 tests produced false negatives. And a review of five studies, by Public Health Madrid, found Covid-19 swabbing produced false negative results the first time round 29 per cent of the time. Experts say false negatives will be a result of incorrect swabbing because there will be variances in how medics - and those taking a test at home - do it.The preferred way - and most accurate, doctors say - is for trained medics to take a nasopharyngeal swab because it collects the most concentrated sample.But the test is so uncomfortable it's been described like 'being stabbed in the brain'. It can cause people to gag and suffer nosebleeds. Photos of drive through centres show healthcare workers opting for the less invasive option of a nose or throat sample.Following the letter, Dr Nick Phin, PHE's incident director, said: 'The testing system is built on strong foundations using latest scientific evidence and advice. 'The different tests in use have been assessed as performing to manufacturers' specifications.'",Web Publication
152,Anger over Dominic Cummings' actions has 'encouraged lockdown rule-breaking';Government scientific adviser warns rejection of guidance raises risk of virus resurgenceCoronavirus - latest updatesSee all our coronavirus coverage,"May 26, 2020 Tuesday",International,The Guardian (London),694,694,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,Ian Sample Science editor,Anger over Dominic Cummings' actions has 'encouraged lockdown rule-breaking'Government scientific adviser warns rejection of guidance raises risk of virus resurgenceCoronavirus - latest updatesSee all our coronavirus coverage,"A scientific adviser to the government has warned that public anger over the conduct of Dominic Cummings has encouraged some people to break lockdown rules, raising the risk of a resurgence in coronavirus infections.Anger over Cummings' actions and the prime minister's defence of them had led some to reject the official guidance on containing the virus, amid perceptions that those in power are failing to make the same sacrifices as the public, the adviser said.""We know that there is understandable public anger over the Dominic Cummings incident and Boris Johnson's defence of it, and that this anger is the basis of some people now rejecting the guidance on staying at home,"" said Prof John Drury, a social psychologist at the University of Sussex.Speaking in a personal capacity, Drury, who sits on the behavioural science subgroup of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), said: ""The starting point for the sacrifices people made was the assumption that we all have to make the same sacrifices. So to perceive that those in power, who supposedly embody the lockdown strategy, are not doing so is toxic.""Drury's intervention came as the row over the prime minister's senior aide continued to grow after he refused to apologise for breaking lockdown regulations and claimed his actions in driving across the country with his family were justified.The incident has left some scientific advisers wondering how they can undo the damage to public trust as the country moves into a critical phase of carefully easing restrictions on movement without risking a second wave of infections and further shutdowns. Many researchers see the coming weeks as the most delicate yet, as the official guidance will become more complex and will only work if the public remain onboard.""Despite the understandable anger, I would urge people to continue to maintain physical distancing and the other regulations, for their families, their neighbours, and their community,"" Drury said. ""In an emergency, no matter what we think of the incumbent government politically, it's crucially important that people listen and adhere to the guidance the authorities provide on the public health measures necessary to mitigate the effects of the pandemic. This includes the instructions to physically distance and to stay at home.""Beyond the concern that some now perceived an ""us and them"" situation with those in power exempt from the restrictions, Drury warned of a shift away from a sense of shared rules towards one of personal judgments taking precedence.Another adviser on the same subgroup, Prof Stephen Reicher at the University of St Andrews, said public solidarity had been fundamental to the success of the lockdown so far and would be as crucial in the weeks and months ahead as ministers looked for the safest route to reopening the country without an upsurge in infections.Speaking in a personal capacity, Reicher said: ""What is absolutely undeniable is that the unity, the sense that we were all pulling together for the common good, has been broken. They have driven a wedge between themselves and at least a proportion of the public who feel alienated and feel there's one law for us and another for them.""If people are acting out of individual interest, you can have huge difficulties in securing adherence to the advice, because for quite a lot of people, the risks for going out are relatively low. If you're young, if you're healthy, there aren't that many risks. So you might say: well, I'm thinking about myself, I might as well go out. It's no problem for me.""Reicher added: ""The thing that really concerns me is that Cummings' defence compounds the problem, because the problem is a lack of an understanding of the importance of thinking and acting in terms of the communal good. It shows that they don't even understand what the problem is.""Going forward, our ability to deal with the pandemic depends upon adherence and compliance as much as ever. That needs to be understood. it's important that people understand that we're still in the middle of this pandemic. The situation is as dangerous as ever and if we stop being vigilant we are in danger.""",Newspaper
153,Changes to behaviour 'could be permanent',"May 10, 2020",International,The Sunday Telegraph (London),408,408,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,Dominic Penna,Changes to behaviour 'could be permanent',"Psychology By Dominic Penna BRITONS have switched from a ""pleasure-seeking"" to ""pain-avoiding"" mentality during the coronavirus pandemic, according to a psychologist who predicts that some behavioural changes linked to the virus could become permanent.Ben Voyer, professor of psychological and behavioural science at the London School of Economics, said the virus had changed the mindset and individual habits of most people.The longer social distancing and other restrictions remain in place, the more likely it is that the associated behavioural changes will become permanent, he has said.""Generally speaking we have evolved to seek pleasure and avoid pain. In a pandemic, you suddenly shift from promotion to prevention - you pay much more attention to what could go wrong, and that change of mindset affects a lot of decisions you are making,"" Prof Voyer said. ""This is likely to perdure until visible reminders of the pandemic are gone - that is, until social distancing and all things described as 'new normal' stay in place.""He said that this focus on avoiding pain explained the stockpiling of lavatory paper. While behavioural changes are likely to be temporary, he said that the longer restrictions are in place, the more this will affect habits long-term.""If by September we are back to normal life, it is unlikely a lot of the things we have had to change to cope with the last few weeks will stay,"" he said.""But if it stays over 12 months or more this will have a more long-term effect."" Prof Voyer said that the focus on cash-free transactions during lockdown could hasten the process of Britain becoming a cash-free society. ""The divide in consumer use of cash is already generational - with older people using more cash than younger people,"" 12 The amount of months after which professor says long-term habits could change due to continuing restrictions "" he said. ""The fact that vulnerable people are asked to keep sheltering while younger ones rejoin the working force could mean that shops accelerate the transition as they find consumers readily accepting this and being able to use dematerialised payment.""In addition, vulnerable people may find it is perhaps better for them to adopt a different form of payment to be and feel safer."" He added that if further research found that the use of banknotes does not significantly contribute to the spread of coronavirus, this could mean that people revert to old habits of using cash.",Newspaper
154,Gavin Williamson insists Dominic Cummings did not break law and says top aide should not resign,"May 25, 2020 Monday",International,standard.co.uk,531,531,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,Ewan Somerville,Gavin Williamson insists Dominic Cummings did not break law and says top aide should not resign,"                     Dominic Cummings did not break any laws and should not have to resign, the Education Secretary has insisted.                     Gavin Williamson said Boris Johnson's top aide should not quit ""because he has made it clear that he's broken no rules and he's broken no laws"".The latest staunch ministerial defence of Mr Cummings comes after the Prime Minister stood firm against a 16-strong Tory rebellion to insist Mr Cummings had            ""acted responsibly, legally and with integrity"".But one of the Government's own scientific experts said a ""debacle"" over the adviser's           alleged two 260-mile trips to Durham has ""fatally undermined"" Mr Johnson's Covid-19 message and will mean ""more people are going to die"". There is growing fury at all levels of the Conservative Party over the claims Mr Cummings made a 260-mile trip from London to the north east in March to self-isolate when his wife had Covid-19 symptoms.It is claimed he made a second trip to Durham in April, having already returned to London, despite lockdown rules urging against long-distance travel. But Mr Williamson defended the aide on Monday morning and said it was his ""understanding"" that ""Dominic Cummings made absolutely clear there was only one trip to Durham"".Asked if he knew if Mr Cummings stopped on the way, he told BBC Radio 4: ""I have not had a conversation with Dominic Cummings. ""The Prime Minister had an extensive discussion with Dominic Cummings yesterday - he did a press conference yesterday.""He made it absolutely clear at the press conference that Dominic Cummings had given him the reassurance that no rules or no laws had been broken but I don't have any more details than that.""The Mirror and Guardian reported that the maverick Downing Street adviser was reported to Durham Police on Sunday by a member of the public who claimed to have spotted him in the city.Retired chemistry teacher Robin Lees has reported Mr Cummings for a suspected breach of lockdown after claiming to have seen Mr Cummings and his family on April 12 walking in the town of Barnard Castle -30 miles from his family home.Downing Street has defended Mr Cummings' actions, insisting he ""acted in line with guidelines"" and that his journey was ""essential"" because it related to the welfare of his child.The fresh defence of Mr Cummings comes as anger mounts from across the political spectrum. Some 16 Tory MPs have now broken ranks to demand he quits or that the PM fire him, with one cabinet minister telling The Times Mr Johnson has ""sacrificed his own credibility to save Dominic Cummings"". Professor Stephen Reicher, who sits on the Government's advisory group of behavioural science which answers to the main Sage committee, said the affair had ""undermined adherence to the forms of behaviour which have got us through this crisis"".The storm over Mr Cummings' actions overshadowed Mr Johnson's latest signal that the lockdown is easing as he confirmed the phased reopening of England's primary schools will commence on June 1.The Cabinet is set to meet later to discuss loosening more aspects of the lockdown, with the changes expected to signal the reopening of some non-essential shops.",Newspaper; Web Publication
155,"Could Deliveroo cash keep local banking alive?;Villagers are being asked to find wacky ways to ensure access to their money, reports Kenza Bryan","June 20, 2020 Saturday",International,The Times (London),1617,1617,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,Kenza Bryan,"Could Deliveroo cash keep local banking alive?Villagers are being asked to find wacky ways to ensure access to their money, reports Kenza Bryan","As digital transactions soar and more banks are threatened with closure, communities have been asked to think big and find innovative ways to retain their local branches - and their access to cash.Less than a quarter of all payments were made in cash last year, a 15 per cent drop on the previous year, according to the banking industry body UK Finance. Yet about two million people still rely on cash for their day-to-day spending and a significant proportion of those have no bank account at all. This could be because they have a poor credit score, no fixed address, no internet or mobile signal, or they find it hard to manage tight family budgets using card payments.To help those people, and others who simply like having cash in their pocket, under a Community Access to Cash pilot scheme eight towns and villages have been asked to come up with ways to ensure that their communities do not get cut off. In return for their brain power, the people of Ampthill, Lulworth, Hay-on-Wye, Botton, Burslem, Cambuslang, Denny and Rochford have been promised that banks will pay to implement some of the changes they request. Here are some previously mooted schemes that they could choose from.? Deliveroo dosh As cash machines become harder to find, residents may choose to have envelopes of cash delivered to their homes by signed delivery or courier in the same way that they order shopping or takeaways. You have been able to have foreign currency delivered to your home for years. RBS has started using Travelex, a foreign currency service, to make cash deliveries of sterling to those who are shielding and cannot go to an ATM in person.The number of free-to-use ATMs dropped from 52,040 in 2018 to 45,355 in 2019, a 13 per cent decrease, according to the cash machine network operator Link.Natalie Ceeney, who conducted a review into access to cash for the government in 2018 and is running the pilot scheme, said: ""The old expensive cash infrastructure, like a bank branch on every high street, is collapsing and we have some new ideas for banks. It is ludicrous that you can order food on Deliveroo, but you cannot get cash picked up or delivered.""Ceeney's report after the scheme ends will be sent to banks to help with their own initiatives.? Shared bank branches The idea of banks sharing one outpost has been mooted since 2002. Different banks would share premises in remote places, where demand for each individual bank is not enough to justify a branch of their own. These counters would accept cash deposits for any bank, but not offer services such as opening and closing accounts.One form of this already exists in the Post Office, which runs basic services for bank customers from more than 10,000 counters in shops including inside WH Smith.More sophisticated shared hubs could look like a normal bank branch except that a number of logos, or no logos at all, would be plastered on the outside. Inside, you could ask for advice about your bank account whether you were with Lloyds, Santander, Barclays or any other bank. The hubs could also make room for new digital banks, such as Starling or Monzo.Derek French, a campaigner for shared banking branches, said that the pilot scheme should widen its focus beyond cash and look at access to services such as face-to-face meetings with bank staff. ""This problem has been deferred and deferred. If banks do not solve it now, people will suffer,"" he said.? Robot bankers Staffing costs are a big overhead and more computer-operated terminals in branches would save money.Richard Chrimes from Instinct Laboratory, a behavioural science consultancy that advises banks, believes that within five years they will use artificial intelligence to replace bank managers with robot advisers who know more about your finances than you.This technology will rely on open banking rules, under which all UKregulated banks have to be able to share all your financial data with other platforms, if you want them to. Mobile phone apps could analyse your spending habits and tell you what you need to cut down on to be eligible for a mortgage or to save more into your pension. Despite all this, however, he thinks that bank branches won't disappear. ""Humans like to relate to humans to share problems and seek advice.""? Bank at the gym Banking hubs could be set up in any empty or underused premises to meet the needs of elderly residents who want to see a bank manager in person. This could be the corner of a sports hall, a library, or a community centre.The principle already exists. RBS has mobile branches that travel to communities, much as libraries used to, and bank managers that fly to remote locations such as the Orkney Islands to serve customers for a few days.Banks have, however, been resistant to the cost of expanding their physical presence away from high streets - 405 bank and building society branches closed last year, according to the consumer group Which? Many have reduced opening hours in the pandemic.? Shop and bank ""Cash recycling"" would allow shops to accept cash deposits on behalf of banks, and customers to take out cash in an extension of the supermarket cashback scheme. Retailers could be paid for offering the service and banks would save on the cost of supplying ATMs, which requires armed vehicles and drivers trained in self-defence.It is not legal for shops to offer cashback if no purchase has been made, due to an EU directive in force since 2018, but this could change after Brexit.? Fancy ATMs An upgrade of cash machines could help communities that have lost access to a bank branch. Deposit-taking ATMs that already exist inside branches could become common on high streets as they are in France and Spain.Nine out of ten transactions that people usually go to the bank for could, with the right technology, be carried out by improving cash machines, says Adam Crighton, an executive at NCR Self Service Banking. People could deposit cash, pick up foreign currency, make loan repayments or transfer money, all from one machine.People might even one day be able to have short conversations with their bank managers through a video option on machines that are not in public places (for security reasons). Crighton said: ""With video ATMs, banks can reduce the need to enter a bank and the number of touchpoints such as cash, coin, cheques or slips, which add to making customers and staff feel more comfortable.""Nationwide Building Society has already used video calls for complex product advice and guidance in 400 branches, allowing customers to consult managers in distant centres.Barclays offers video banking through its app for complex operations such as loan applications, registering power of attorney or reporting fraud.Last week Cardtronics, which bills itself as the world's largest ATM operator, started offering a cash-withdrawal service that works for those with no bank accounts and no internet.Businesses, charities and government agencies can send people a unique code by text message that will allow them to unlock wages, grants or benefits. At the ATM they simply enter their phone number, the unique code, and a four-digit pin to access their money.? Better infrastructure Hay-on-Wye in Powys has only 2,000 residents, but is well known for its yearly literary festival. Lulworth, a village on the Jurassic Coast in Dorset, has 2,500 troops and 1,500 family members at a Ministry of Defence army barracks and yet no cash machine. Both of these locations suffer from poor mobile signal, making digital payments difficult, and in Lulworth residents without a car find it difficult to get to the neigbouring village, which has a Post Office counter a few days a week where banking can be done.It is a similar story at the five other locations taking part in the trial: the village of Botton in the North York Moors national park; Burslem, part of Stoke-on-Trent in Staffordshire; Cambuslang in South Lanarkshire; Ampthill in Bedfordshire; Denny in Falkirk and Rochford, an Essex town with an ageing population.The biggest change that could improve access to cash and banking facilities might be improvements to local infrastructure, giving residents digital education and access to technology. These would all be funded by the banks and be tailored to each location. It could involve boosting mobile-phone signals to help residents to complete banking transactions.For example, in the case of a village whose nearest ATM is in a badly lit corner of a petrol station a 15-minute drive from the residential centre, the scheme could ask the council to create a new bus stop outside the ATM or to install a street light.Branching out Ampthill in Bedfordshire is one of eight locations whose bid to take part in the Community Access to Cash Pilot was approved last week. The town's 6,500 people are served by five pubs, two hotels, two restaurants and one free-to-use ATM, but the only trace of a bank branch is a boarded-up window of the Natwest that closed in 2017.Ampthill's market has provided residents with meat, fish, fruit and vegetables, and bread and cheese since 1219. Many of the businesses behind the stalls still rely on cash, however, and the village has a substantial elderly population who have told local authorities that they would rather walk into town to visit their bank manager than go online.Despite this, the only option for businesses looking to deposit cash is a Post Office counter in the village shop.The mayor, Ian Titman, wants to use the review to call for a banking hub.He says there is one obvious location - the building that has remained empty since Natwest left the town and whose scaffolding has finally come down.6,685 cash machines closed between 2018 and 2019",Newspaper
156,Did UK's coronavirus crisis peak BEFORE lockdown?

Research suggests darkest day of the outbreak was March 18 - five days before draconian measures were introduced (and it happened in Norway too...),"•Modelling by a mathematician at University of Bristol shows Britain's infection rate peaked on March 18•The calculation is based on data that indicates average Covid-19 victim dies 23 days after being infected•The study throws into question whether Britain's lockdown - imposed on March 23 - was actually needed                     Britain's coronavirus outbreak may have been under control before lockdown was enforced, according to a study that throws into question whether the draconian measures were ever needed. Data modelling by a mathematician at Bristol University suggests the spread of Covid-19 throughout the UK had peaked days before Boris Johnson introduced the unprecedented curbs. The calculation is based on a growing body of data that indicates the average Covid-19 victim dies 23 days after being infected.The darkest days in the UK's outbreak were on April 8 and 9, when more than 2,000 people passed away from the virus, official figures show. Professor Simon Wood believes most of these patients were infected between March 18 and 19 - 23 days earlier - and five days before the country locked down.He claims that banning large gatherings and telling people to keep two metres apart would have been sufficient to keep the virus under control. The study throws into question whether Britain's lockdown was needed amid claims social distancing policies announced on March 16 curbed the crisis on their own.It comes after similar research in Norway also found the spread of the virus fell fairly quickly there by the time people were ordered to stay at home.Camille Stoltenberg, head of the Norwegian Institute of Public Health (NIPH), even admitted last month that locking down was unnecessary. [related]PEOPLE WERE SOCIAL DISTANCING BEFORE LOCKDOWN - BUT NOT SHIELDING  Survey data presented by the SAGE sub-group SPI-B on March 22, the day before lockdown, found people were already taking many of the measures themselves.Some 62 per cent of people under the age of 70 said they had already stopped going to pubs, bars and restaurants.A further 52 per cent said they had stopped going to sports or hobby clubs, because of social distancing advice, along with 30 per cent who were by then working from home.Half of public transport users had stopped getting buses or trains to try and stop the spread of the virus.But SPI-B was concerned that between 37 and 54 per cent of the people most at risk from the coronavirus - those who are advised to 'shield' themselves - were still meeting up with friends and family.The report said: 'Although survey respondents report having stopped or cut down many behaviours, there appears to be room for social distancing to be increased still further.'Boris Johnson sent the UK into full lockdown the next day, March 23, and urged everyone to stay at home at all times except for essential journeys.HOW AN IMMUNOLOGICAL 'DARK MATTER' COULD PREVENT A SECOND WAVE Many scientists argue that lifting the lockdown will lead to a second wave - which some have warned will be even more lethal than the first - because millions of Brits have still yet to be infected and developed any form of immunity against the disease. But other top experts have challenged the claims, and one epidemiologist at Oxford University even claimed half of Britain has already been infected, even though official antibody sampling suggests fewer than 10 per cent have had it.This may be because millions of people have pre-existing immunity that means their immune system hasn't had to create Covid-specific antibodies, she says. Professor Gupta - whose initial prediction was rubbished by fellow scientists and says the virus has followed exactly the same trend worldwide regardless of lockdown policies - isn't the only one to warn of an immunological 'dark matter' that is stopping the virus from infecting as many people as once feared. Studies are beginning to add weight to the theory, with one suggesting people who have fought off the common cold may be protected from Covid-19. Researchers in California analysed 11 blood samples from people previously struck down with another type of coronavirus that causes a runny nose.Half of the samples contained disease-fighting T cells that recognised SARS-CoV-2 virus in the lab, and 20 per cent had cells that may able to kill the virus.The evidence, as well as studies showing the virus has taken the same trend across the world, has prompted some experts to dismiss the chances of a second wave. Professor Wood said: 'The most notable feature of the results is that fatal infections are inferred to be in substantial decline before lockdown.'He said it was possible that social distancing 'might have done the trick' in bringing down Covid-19 cases and deaths without heavy-handed measures. On March 16, the UK Government launched a public information campaign urging people to wash their hands and keep two metres (6'6') away from others.Many Britons were already working from home, shops, restaurants and gyms were closing and large public gatherings had been banned. He said it was difficult to be certain when infections peaked in Britain because widespread testing was abandoned in mid-March.However his analysis also showed that Sweden's infections peaked just a few days after Britain, even without a lockdown.It suggests the UK's crisis would have followed the same trajectory with the less severe social distancing rules. Professor Wood said if a second wave hits Britain then ministers should consider 'ethical issues' of locking down again and whether it would claim more life than it saves. Writing in the study, which is published on the open access research site arXiv but not yet scrutinised by other scientists, said a second lockdown could be disastrous for the nation's wellbeing.He said: 'These facts have implications for the policies to be adopted in the coming autumn, particularly given the peculiar ethical issues associated with lockdown,''For example, plausible estimates of the life loss burden from an unmitigated Covid-19 epidemic in the UK are about two weeks per person. 'A plausible lower bound on the UK life loss from the 2008 financial crisis and its aftermath is seven weeks per person. The economic shock from lockdown is substantially larger than 2008.' Commenting on the findings, Professor Carl Heneghan - a leading expert at the University of Oxford and staunch critic of the lockdown - said Professor Wood's analysis was in line with data from the Royal College of GPs (RCGP). Professor Heneghan said RCGP figures show infection rates halved in the week beginning March 15 - at the time when social distancing was enforced. He said ministers 'lost sight' of the evidence and rushed into a nationwide quarantine six days later after being instructed by scientific advisers who he claims have been 'consistently wrong' during the crisis.Data shows the rate of Britons with upper respiratory tract infections dropped from 20 per 100,000 people on March 15 to around 12 per 100,000 just six days later.The figures do not relate solely to coronavirus but may be a good indicator because so few people were being tested for the deadly infection. Many scientists argue that lifting the lockdown will lead to a second wave - which some have warned will be even more lethal than the first - because millions of Brits have still yet to be infected and developed any form of immunity against the disease. But other top experts have challenged the claims, and one epidemiologist at Oxford University even claimed half of Britain has already been infected, even though official antibody sampling suggests fewer than 10 per cent have had it.This may be because millions of people have pre-existing immunity that means their immune system hasn't had to create Covid-specific antibodies, she says.

Studies are beginning to add weight to the theory, with one suggesting people who have fought off the common cold may be protected from Covid-19. 'Professor Lockdown' admits Sweden may have suppressed Covid-19 to the same level but WITHOUT draconian measures   The professor whose grim warning that 500,000 Brits may die from Covid-19 without action triggered lockdown has admitted Sweden may have suppressed its outbreak as well as Britain - without imposing the draconian measures. Professor Neil Ferguson, of Imperial College London, revealed he had the 'greatest respect' for the Scandinavian nation, which has managed to suffer fewer deaths per capita than the UK. He made the comments at a House of Lords Science and Technology Committee today during his first public appearance since flouting stay at home rules to have secret trysts with his married mistress last month. The epidemiologist - dubbed Professor Lockdown - has come under fire for his modelling which predicted half a million Britons could die from Covid-19 and heavily influenced the UK's decision to rush into a nationwide quarantine. Professor Ferguson appeared to praise Sweden for keeping infections low without the economically crippling curbs and said 'they have gone quite a long way to [achieving] the same effect'.But when he was grilled by peers about whether the measures were really necessary in the UK, he pointed out that Sweden's infection rate had not fallen as rapidly as the Britain's.Researchers in California analysed 11 blood samples from people previously struck down with another type of coronavirus that causes a runny nose.Half of the samples contained disease-fighting T cells that recognised SARS-CoV-2 virus in the lab, and 20 per cent had cells that may able to kill the virus.The evidence, as well as studies showing the virus has taken the same trend across the world, has prompted some experts to dismiss the chances of a second wave. But this theory has been thrown into question today after Iran has become the first country in the world to report a second wave of coronavirus infections after easing its lockdown.The Middle Eastern nation logged a record 3,574 cases of the virus on Wednesday, beating its previous worst day of 3,186 cases logged on March 30.Iran began easing its lockdown restrictions - which were imposed in February as the virus ran rampant - in mid-April as the disease declined.Cases began picking up again in early May and have now been above 3,000 for three days running, even as gyms and public offices were reopened at the weekend.Iranian health officials have argued that the 'second wave' is actually the result of better testing and data-logging, after serious doubts were raised over the accuracy of its data when the virus first hit.That is partially confirmed by the fact that the country's daily death figures have not been rising along with the infection total.The state-run IRNA news agency reported 59 deaths on Wednesday, slightly below the May average of 60 deaths per day.If the true number of infections including those not picked up in tests had been rising, then the number of deaths would be expected to follow suit.

""We're looking at ways of making sure that people really do have face coverings, in shops, for example.""On Friday, face coverings became compulsory in Scottish shops, but people do not have to wear them in stores in England, Wales or Northern Ireland.Johnson said new rules might be needed to overcome a lack of tradition around mask use. ""It's very interesting, because in places like China or Taiwan, the far east, they don't actually have mandatory face coverings, it's just part of the way they do things. Clearly we don't have that culture here in the UK, and we have to think about how we make it happen and how we make it work.""Masks are mandatory on public transport in England, and official guidance says people should also wear them in shops and other enclosed spaces, but Johnson and his senior team have rarely been photographed wearing one.The prime minister was seen publicly in a mask for the first time on Friday, donning a bright blue one in his Uxbridge constituency.Senior scientists had urged ministers to wear masks in public more often to set a good example. Rishi Sunak, the chancellor, was pictured without a mask while serving a meal to customers in a restaurant following his mini-budget this week, and he has also been photographed bumping elbows with people as a greeting.Other politicians have been less wary of face coverings. Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland's first minister, prompted a boom in sales of a brand of tartan mask after wearing one for an event where she outlined new Scottish rules for combating coronavirus.Keir Starmer, the Labour leader, was pictured this week wearing a full protective visor during a visit to an engineering firm in Essex. The Liberal Democrat leadership candidates Ed Davey and Layla Moran have also been seen in masks.Prof Anthony Costello, a former director at the World Health Organization, criticised Sunak for not wearing a face covering while serving meals to promote the ""Eat out to help out"" scheme. He said it was ""a terrible mistake"" and urged ministers to set an example and wear face coverings in enclosed spaces.Costello told a briefing of the Independent Sage group that recent research from Hong Kong had highlighted theincreased coronavirus risk in indoor spaces, with most clusters of infections coming from ""mask-off"" settings such as bars, restaurants and gyms. ""Our message is: wear masks indoors, wear masks in public places, and I think ministers should be setting a good example, and they are not doing that right now, particularly in England,"" he said.The Independent Sage committee was set up by Sir David King, a former chief scientific adviser, amid concerns about the transparency of the government's own Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage).Speaking at the same briefing, Prof Susan Michie, director of the Centre for Behaviour Change at UCL, said fresh concerns around possible airborne transmission of the virus, as well as evidence of the effectiveness of masks in Germany, had ""tipped the balance in favour of wearing masks in indoor, enclosed settings"".She said: ""We are not a society that is used to wearing face masks, so we need to get every single lever that we can to make this happen. We've obviously had it made compulsory on transport, but that is not enough. We need a good mass education, persuasion and training campaign, because people do need to wear the right kinds of masks in the right way in order to make them maximally effective.""Matt Hancock, the health secretary, has been pictured in a mask, as has the culture secretary, Oliver Dowden. The culture minister, Caroline Dinenage, said on Friday that she wore masks designed and made by her son, a fashion student.A Downing Street spokesman, when asked if he could name any more ministers to have publicly worn a mask, said: ""I don't spend my time with individual ministers.""On Sunak's elbow-bump greetings, the spokesman said: ""The social distancing guidelines are clear, we have set out what they are, and all the ministerial team, including the prime minister, abide by them when they're out and about.""",Newspaper
158,Investors would be wise to take note of the firms deciding to float now,"June 19, 2020 Friday",International,The Daily Telegraph (London),879,879,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,GARRY WHITE,Investors would be wise to take note of the firms deciding to float now,"After a lockdown hiatus, the IPO market has returned with a bang. This week saw success for US listings in biotech and pharmaceuticals - and news is expected in the next few weeks on major flotations in cloud computing, big data and artificial intelligence. This forthcoming wave of IPOs, with boards prepared to pull the trigger on a stock market listing despite an ongoing pandemic, is highlighting areas that are likely to do well whatever happens with Covid-19. Investors would be wise to take note.On Wednesday, Royalty Pharma became America's biggest IPO this year. The company buys into royalty streams by co-funding late-stage clinical trials of drugs in return for future payments once they are approved. Despite the fact the shares were priced at the top end of its indicated range and it issued more equity than initially planned, its shares soared almost 60pc on their first day.Five other US biotech companies have listed this week and Amwell Health, a telemedicine group that provides remote healthcare services through video calls, has filed plans to float soon. Last month, it raised $194m (£153m) in a private fundraising to help it keep up with skyrocketing demand for its services during lockdown. The combination of health and remote technology means interest will be high.The healthcare sector has outperformed the broader market significantly this year as demand for its products and services remains robust.However, the next few weeks are expected to see news of more IPOs that will highlight other areas that are likely to see good growth in a postpandemic world - and data will be a significant theme.Silicon Valley-based Snowflake filed confidentially for an IPO last week and should list in the coming months. The group publishes software which allows users to analyse large amounts of data stored across multiple cloud platforms, such as Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure. Also in the pipeline is artificial intelligence (AI) and behavioural economics group Lemonade, which is a fintech firm with big hopes of disrupting the insurance sector. The company uses data analysis and an AI chat bot called Maya to calculate insurance rates for homeowners and renters - cutting costs and saving money for insurance issuers and customers alike.The rise of cloud-based services, which store lots of data remotely, has provided a significant opportunity for those such as Lemonade to develop AI to interrogate the data sets. Indeed, this is exactly the area in which the most interesting company that is listing in the next few months operates - Palantir Technologies.Set up by PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel, one of Donald Trump's biggest supporters in Silicon Valley, Palantir is expected to announce its IPO in the next couple of weeks. The highly secretive group gathers data from public and private databases to find patterns in police reports, addresses, credit card transactions, criminal records and photos. Its contract with enforcement officers from US Immigration and Customs in their search for undocumented migrants for deportation has proved particularly controversial. The group was also granted access to sensitive NHS data to assist in the pandemic, which has prompted some concern.In March, Palantir was enlisted to support the NHS's pandemic response - and help build a platform to predict demand on hospitals across the country. Palantir now has access to information such as a patient's age, address, health conditions, treatments and other personal data such as whether they smoke or drink. This is clearly a sensitive area as this type of data is a highly valuable commodity to companies targeting future profits in this area. The NHS is also sharing data with Google unit DeepMind. The Government insists that any data files that will make a patient personally identifiable are replaced with a pseudonym or aggregated before they're shared with Palantir.The technology unicorn has already worked with a wide range of government agencies in the US, including the CIA.However, its Gotham product, which pulls all data relevant to a single person and packages it for police, intelligence and corporate security officials, is likely to always be targeted by campaigners.Although there is a significant amount of suspicion about the use of personal data by large companies, the Covid-19 pandemic has highlighted just how useful data analytics can be.This week, China identified about 350,000 people for testing after interrogating phone positioning records to identify individuals who had entered the market in Beijing, where the latest Covid-19 outbreak started. Its usefulness is undeniable.However, this is largely irrelevant as governments are already issuing contracts, with all parties insisting that the data is secure.The companies coming to market in the next few months are therefore interesting for investors. Healthcare, cloud computing and AI are all hot areas because, whatever happens in the pandemic, they are still expected to grow earnings. The IPOs should act as signposts for investors to identify sectors worth a closer look.Garry White is chief investment commentator at wealth management company Charles Stanley'Royalty Pharma became America's biggest IPO this year, with its shares soaring 60pc on the first day'",Newspaper

In his speech Mr Johnson also urged the British public to return to work if they are unable to work at home. He said: ""We now need to stress that anyone who can't work from home, for instance those in construction or manufacturing, should be actively encouraged to go to work.""The PM also asked people to avoid public transport if possible and encouraged cycling and walking. Trish Greenhalgh, professor of primary care health sciences at the University of Oxford, said: ""It looks like the PM is trying to implement the 'have cake and eat it' maxim he popularised in a previous life.""On the one hand, he says he's not lifting the lockdown because he is determined to avoid a second peak.""On the other hand, he appears very keen to lift the lockdown because he urgently needs to fix the economy.""Anyone unable to work from home should now return to work from work though they are also advised to avoid public transport, so it's not clear how they will get there.""I can't see what the 'guidance for employers' is going to say, but employers won't be able to generate two metres of distance between employees out of thin air.""The Government has yet to take a positive stance on face coverings, which in addition to continuing hand-washing is probably the one public health measure that could enable us to ease out of lockdown more safely.""Leaving aside who we're allowed to play tennis with from Wednesday, this announcement seems to be pitching at a middle ground that could give us the worst of both worlds.""Deputy chief executive of NHS Providers, Saffron Cordery, said nobody wanted to see restrictions in place for any longer than necessary.""They've helped to protect the NHS and save lives, but they've also caused sacrifice and hardship,"" she said.""So we need a balanced approach, led by the science and clearly communicated so people know what they need to do.""That means easing restrictions when it's safe to do so.""But we must not let down our guard.""For health and care services this will require regular, reliable and easily accessible testing for all staff and patients, backed up by an effective programme of contact tracing, to contain any potential second surge in cases.Cafes and restaurants could start to re-open in July -but there's bad news for pubs""Unfortunately -despite increasing testing capacity -we don't see that detailed and developed approach in place at the moment. We need it now.""Dr Michael Head, senior research fellow in global health at the University of Southampton, said: ""For these revisions to be successful, we need consistent communications from the Government, and the new 'stay alert' messaging is ambiguous and lacks clarity.""We also need the general public to continue to practise social distancing, but there were so many examples of parties and gatherings during the bank holiday weekend, and if that continues that will only serve to increase transmission and delay the country fully reopening.""Professor Dame Til Wykes, from King's College London, said: ""Encouraging people to leave their homes is now going to be difficult with many people having followed the 'stay home' message.""Individuals who are anxious, and many are, will find it tough to respond to the plan and will need some evidence of how safe travelling or work will be.""The communication plan of 'stay alert, control the virus and save lives' -unlike the first step in the plan -is very confused.""We need clear rules and messages that are concise, clear and accurate. This is just short. It is clearly a message written by a communications committee and was never tested in a focus group or with behavioural scientists. A woolly message will hinder, not promote the next phase of this lockdown.""Dr Ron Daniels, an intensive care consultant based in Birmingham, told PA: ""The reality is that the effect of a second wave is just so unknown that it is too risky in most health professionals' view to relax lockdown right now.""We would like to see our capacity in NHS hospitals back down to below usual levels before we can safely do that.""""Do we have enough beds to cope with a second wave if lockdown is relaxed too much Absolutely not. We're still over our usual capacity."" He added: ""The relative impact of any second wave all depends on how many members of our public have already been exposed to this novel coronavirus. Of course, we don't know. ""It may be, as some optimistic estimates suggest, as high as 60-80 per cent of the public who have been exposed. That would mean that a lot of people had had exposure to the virus and not developed symptoms and just gone about their lives as normal.""But the more pessimistic, the more wary estimates, suggest that somewhere under 10 per cent of our population have been exposed.""If that's true, then we expect the second wave -if lockdown is relaxed too quickly and too aggressively -could even be bigger than the first.""Boris Johnson's announcement came as Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland all said they would be sticking to the same ""stay at home"" advice for the public.Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon warned it could be ""catastrophic"" to change the guidance and that the current messaging was ""clear"".On Monday the Government will publish a 50-page document outlining the full plan to cautiously re-start the economy.Nearly seven weeks after the UK entered lockdown, Cabinet minister Robert Jenrick told the BBC: ""The message ... of staying at home now does need to be updated, we need to have a broader message because we want to slowly and cautiously restart the economy and the country.""It comes as the Government failed to meet its own 100,000 tests per day target for the seventh day in a row.",Newspaper; Web Publication
160,"The SAGE files: Government advisers warned in February that PHE's contact tracing capacity would be 'exhausted' in TWO WEEKS, that there was no evidence for stopping hand-shaking and studies on face masks were 'weak' with mixed results","June 5, 2020 Friday",International,MailOnline,3537,3537,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,Sam Blanchard Senior Health Reporter For Mailonline,"The SAGE files: Government advisers warned in February that PHE's contact tracing capacity would be 'exhausted' in TWO WEEKS, that there was no evidence for stopping hand-shaking and studies on face masks were 'weak' with mixed results","•Government published papers that were presented to SAGE in March/April•They cover international flights, face masks, social distancing and children•And showed that scientists agreed contact tracing should be abandoned                     Public Health England only had enough contact-tracing capacity to last two weeks before it became 'exhausted', scientists warned in February.Experts said capacity should be increased immediately but admitted it could only be expanded about 10-fold, to contact 8,000 people per day, which still wouldn't be enough. A batch of scientific papers submitted to the Government's SAGE committee were published today and reveal more of what officials were being told in the early stages of the UK's epidemic.Researchers said there was 'no evidence' that stopping shaking hands would reduce transmission of the virus, shortly after Prime Minister Boris Johnson was ridiculed for continuing to use the greeting.The papers also showed that there was little evidence in favour of wearing face masks, which have now become mandatory on public transport in Britain.SAGE's papers have been published as data today revealed that the coronavirus is fading away in England, with only 0.1 per cent of the population now thought to be affected. This is around 53,000 people, and a drop from an estimated 133,000 in last week's data. There are now around 5,500 people becoming newly infected each day.The SAGE papers revealed the following:•People were already following social distancing before Britain's lockdown but up to 54 per cent of people in the extra-vulnerable group were not shielding;•Stopping international flights would not have been a useful measure for the UK during lockdown because there were too many cases already and imported infections would have been drops in an ocean;•By mid-April there was only 'weak' and low-quality evidence that face masks could reduce the transmission of Covid-19 if worn by infected patients;•People in some settings, such as carers for vulnerable people, may have been better off self-isolating for two weeks. And 'particular caution' was urged for discharging people from hospitals to care homes;•Contact tracing is of 'limited benefit' in a large, uncontrolled outbreak and Public Health England's capacity would have been exhausted within a fortnight;•Scientists said contact tracing should be stopped when the first case of coronavirus was diagnosed without any clear link to another country or confirmed case;•Antibody test data - which shows who has had the virus already - should have been available early on in the outbreak to track the size of the epidemic;•Evidence suggested children under the age of 10 are infected at similar rates to adults but are more likely to have no symptoms;•Less than 10 per cent of infectious droplets travel further than 5'5"" (1.65m), and transmission at more than 3'2"" (1m) appeared to only be common in hospitals;•Public Health England modelling predicted that the peak of infections would be towards the end of April if the outbreak was uncontrolled.The SAGE files are now released every Friday as part of a transparency drive by the Government to show the public what advice government officials have been given.This week's batch of reports revealed the scientific evidence Whitehall looked at on a number of topics, including international flights, social distancing, face masks, how far the virus travels in the air, when people are most infectious, and how well contact tracing would work.One of the most damning revelations was that officials were told in February that Public Health England's contact tracing system would not be enough to cope beyond the very start of an epidemic.At the time it had the capacity to cope with contacting around 800 people per day, scaleable to 8,000 per day, scientists said.Contact tracing was brought to an end on March 12 when Professor Chris Whitty, the chief medical officer for England, admitted it was no longer a good use of resources. It has since emerged that this was because too many people had the virus already.The Government has come under fire for that decision, with other countries like South Korea, which maintained the policy, escaping almost unscathed by the virus. This is what today's SAGE papers revealed: Contact tracing 'should be discontinued once it is overwhelmed' A paper sent to SAGE by Public Health England and the universities of Manchester and Cambridge on February 12 warned about the limitations of contact tracing.A process it called CCI - case and contact isolation - was effective at preventing low-level outbreaks but the capacity in the UK would be quickly overwhelmed if the virus spread out of control.                     ENGLAND'S CORONAVIRUS OUTBREAK SHRINKS BY HALF                   England's coronavirus outbreak appears to have shrunk by half in the past week, official data has revealed.The Office for National Statistics predicts that there are now only 53,000 people in England who currently have Covid-19 - 0.1 per cent of the population.This estimate is a significant drop from the 133,000 people (0.24 per cent) who were thought to the have the illness in the same data last week. It is based on swab testing of almost 20,000 random people across the country.And the ONS says that around 39,000 people per week are catching the infection - 5,500 per day, which is a drop from 54,000 per week between May 16 and May 23.The ONS report said: 'As the proportion of those testing positive in England is decreasing over time, it is likely that the incidence rate is also decreasing. 'However, because of the low number of new positive cases, we cannot currently measure a reduction.' Different data from blood antibody tests, published yesterday by Public Health England, suggested that around 8.5 per cent of the country has had the virus already - some 4.76million people.Professor Keith Neal, an epidemiologist at the University of Nottingham, said: 'The rate of infection continues to decline and is half what it was two weeks ago. Changes over a longer period are now statistically significant. 'This is highly compatible with the fall in diagnosed cases. The contact tracing service has more than enough staff to cope with the current level of infection.' The researchers said PHE's capacity - predicted to be good for contacting 800 people per day - should be increased 10-fold at the least. But it would have to be abandoned when the outbreak spiralled.The paper warned: 'Where cases of higher generational numbers become predominant CCI is expected to be of limited benefit outside of certain special cases and should be discontinued.The current PHE based capacity to provide CCI can be expected to be not sufficient, or sustainable, at the limits of controlling higher rates of incursions into the UK, and should be enhanced... 'We recommend that CCI should be discontinued when person to person spread is epidemiologically demonstrated to be dominated by second and subsequent generational cases, or, by the contact tracing effort exceeding the management of 8,000 CCI events per day as a proxy.' Another report suggested that contact tracing should be ended once doctors started to see cases that had no clear links to countries abroad or other confirmed patients. People were social distancing before lockdown - but not shielding Survey data presented by the SAGE sub-group SPI-B on March 22, the day before lockdown, found people were already taking many of the measures themselves.Some 62 per cent of people under the age of 70 said they had already stopped going to pubs, bars and restaurants. A further 52 per cent said they had stopped going to sports or hobby clubs, because of social distancing advice, along with 30 per cent who were by then working from home.Half of public transport users had stopped getting buses or trains to try and stop the spread of the virus.But SPI-B was concerned that between 37 and 54 per cent of the people most at risk from the coronavirus - those who are advised to 'shield' themselves - were still meeting up with friends and family.The report said: 'Although survey respondents report having stopped or cut down many behaviours, there appears to be room for social distancing to be increased still further.'Boris Johnson sent the UK into full lockdown the next day, March 23, and urged everyone to stay at home at all times except for essential journeys. Evidence for face masks as protection was 'weak' and mixedPapers from the first and second weeks of April on the effectiveness of face masks found no clear reason to recommend that British people should wear them.Researchers noted that scientific studies had had mixed results on their effectiveness and that much of the evidence was not relevant to British society - one had examined how well they worked during pilgrimage.A paper on April 7 said: 'Based on the evidence... wearing face mask in the community was not significantly associated with a reduction in episodes of influenza-like illness'.Scientists quoted a paper that found: 'Cloth face masks are not as effective as surgical face masks'. Another paper dated April 13 rowed back slightly but still stopped short of saying face masks should be worn.It read: 'There is weak evidence that use of face masks by symptomatic people may reduce transmission.'Evidence from randomised trials do not show a protective effect of face masks in community settings but are often affected by low adherence.'                      RESEARCH SUGGESTS UK'S CORONAVIRUS CRISIS PEAKED BEFORE LOCKDOWN                    Britain's coronavirus outbreak may have been under control before lockdown was enforced, according to a study that throws into question whether the draconian measures were ever needed. Data modelling by a mathematician at Bristol University suggests the spread of Covid-19 throughout the UK had peaked days before Boris Johnson introduced the unprecedented curbs. The calculation is based on a growing body of data that indicates the average Covid-19 victim dies 23 days after being infected.The darkest days in the UK's outbreak were on April 8 and 9, when more than 2,000 people passed away from the virus, official figures show. Professor Simon Wood believes most of these patients were infected between March 18 and 19 - 23 days earlier - and five days before the country locked down.He claims that banning large gatherings and telling people to keep two metres apart would have been sufficient to keep the virus under control. The study throws into question whether Britain's lockdown was needed amid claims social distancing policies announced on March 16 curbed the crisis on their own.It comes after similar research in Norway also found the spread of the virus fell fairly quickly there by the time people were ordered to stay at home.Camille Stoltenberg, head of the Norwegian Institute of Public Health (NIPH), even admitted last month that locking down was unnecessary. Professor Wood said: 'The most notable feature of the results is that fatal infections are inferred to be in substantial decline before lockdown.'He said it was possible that social distancing 'might have done the trick' in bringing down Covid-19 cases and deaths without heavy-handed measures. On March 16, the UK Government launched a public information campaign urging people to wash their hands and keep two metres (6'6') away from others.Many Britons were already working from home, shops, restaurants and gyms were closing and large public gatherings had been banned. He said it was difficult to be certain when infections peaked in Britain because widespread testing was abandoned in mid-March.The study suggested the masks could be beneficial if people were likely to cough, because it would catch infectious droplets, but noted that people should be self-isolating if they were unwell.Face masks were yesterday made mandatory on public transport for people in the UK. No evidence for stopping hand-shakes, and only 10% of droplets go further than 1.65metresIn a paper dated March 12 scientists discussed how the virus might be transmitted from person to person and looked at hand-shaking and droplet spread in the air.They found: 'There is no evidence that avoiding handshakes reduces the risk of infection but on first principles it may result in a minor reduction in risk.'The paper said that shaking hands was only likely to be a risk if one of the people had the virus on their hands and the other, after shaking their hand, then touched their eyes, nose or mouth. There were other surfaces people could pick up the virus from and shaking hands did not appear to add any risk, the paper suggested, as long as both people had clean hands.It added: 'If people wish to avoid handshakes, it is reasonable.'The same paper explored how far droplets containing the virus would spread in the air and said only 10 per cent of them made it further than 5'5"" (1.65m) after leaving someone's mouth.Social distancing guidelines in the UK are currently to stay 6'6"" (2m) away from others, but shops, cafes and pubs are pushing back to try and get this reduced so they can let customers return.The SAGE paper said studies of other viruses found almost 90 per cent of droplets from talking alone fell to the ground within 30cm, while for coughing around 15 per cent could travel 50cm. It concluded: 'In terms of risk of transmission via close contact in the community, 1 metre is a minimum, 2 metres is precautionary.' PHE predicted 60,000 per day could need intensive care Predictions made by Public Health England in March laid bare how government scientists knew the potential devastation the epidemic could cause.Their calculations predicted that, if social distancing was not successful, the virus could have led to 60,000 people per day needing intensive care at its peak.In this scenario it predicted the peak would come at the beginning of May and would clearly have been devastating.Graphs in the report showed 2.5million new infections per day across the country was not outside the realms of possibility, peaking in mid-April.The peak of infections is actually thought to have arrived in March, owing to the lockdown measures, before a peak in hospital deaths hit on April 8.The PHE report in March said: 'Current data on confirmed cases and deaths indicate a possible peak in infections as early as mid April and a corresponding peak in ICU admissions well above current capacity.' Use 'particular caution' when discharging patients to care homesNERVTAG, one of SAGE's advisory groups, warned the Government in April that particular care should be taken if discharging hospital patients to care homes.Officials have come under fire for doing this in the early stages of the outbreak as care bosses accused them of doing it without testing people, and in the process 'seeding' devastating outbreaks that killed many residents.At least 12,500 care home residents are known to have died as a direct result of Covid-19, while many more are thought to have died from indirect effects.NERVTAG's report was concerning the length of time people should isolate for if they had coronavirus but did not need hospital treatment.It said seven days was 'reasonble' for people with mild illness but others might need longer.They could include carers, people with weakened immune systems, or more seriously ill patients, who may remain infectious for longer.                      CONTACT TRACING APP 'WON'T WORK PROPERLY UNTIL OCTOBER'                    Grant Shapps today appeared to confirm the NHS Covid-19 contact-tracing app won't work perfectly when it is eventually launched nationwide to help halt the spread of the infection in Britain.The Transport Secretary responded to claims that the app - considered the 'cherry on the cake' of Number 10's flagship Test and Trace scheme - would be 'imperfect' and 'clunky' for several months.He said on BBC Radio 4's Today programme: 'Anyone who downloads an app on their phone knows it is forever being updated and bugs squashed and all the rest of it. Apps are never complete in that sense.'Business Minister Nadhim Zahawi last night revealed the app won't go live until the end of the month - despite officials first promising it would be ready to roll-out across Britain in mid-May following a trial on the Isle of Wight.He said on BBC Question Time the app, which was supposed to form a crucial part of the NHS Test and Trace scheme when it was launched in England and Scotland last week, would be rolled out when it is 'robust'.However, Tony Prestedge, chief operating officer for the contact tracing system, is said to have told employees it would be 'imperfect and clunky', claiming it wouldn't be world-class until 'September or October time'.Former Labour leader Ed Miliband today said he hoped the claim wasn't true, telling Good Morning Britain: 'Let's have some clear answers from the government on when the system will be up and running.'Critics have claimed the development of the app has been 'chaotic'. Concerns were raised almost from day one amid fears it could drain phone batteries, didn't work on older mobiles and wouldn't be downloaded by the elderly.The delay of the app means the scheme is currently reliant on an army of 25,000 tracers to track people down and prevent a second wave of infections. But staff paid up to £27-an-hour on the scheme have told of the 'shambolic' programme, which has seen workers left with no-one to call and unable to even log-in.The report added: 'Particular caution should be exercised in Covid-19 patients discharged from hospital to nursing homes, homeless shelters, or other institutions where there are vulnerable individuals.' Stopping international flights 'not a useful measure' in March In a paper dated March 22, the day before lockdown, scientists said stopping international flights in a bid to stop people bringing the coronavirus to the UK from abroad was 'not a useful measure'.There were so many people already infected in Britain that any imported cases would be drops in the ocean, the paper explained.It said: 'The initial view from SPI-M is that given the current widescale transmission of COVID-19 within the UK, measures to stop imported cases would have negligible impact. This might change if the UK were to successfully contain the epidemic.'On the subject of 'hotspots' the SPI-M committee suggested that flights from Spain and Iran were probably the highest risk.Spain because of the sheer number of passengers - there were some 15,000 per day still arriving on weekday flights that week.And Iran because of the severity of the outbreak there - even though passenger numbers were low, there was a high chance some of them might have the illness.It said flights from countries like France, Italy and Germany were low-risk because they were going through the same experience as the UK and passenger numbers were already low because of their government and airline restrictions.Britain did not force flights to stop but told people not to travel abroad. Airlines took it upon themselves to stop most flights when passenger numbers dried up.Antibody data should be available early in the epidemic Scientists said data from antibody tests - which test people's blood to see whether they have had the disease in the past - should be made available as early as possible. Public Health England and the Office for National Statistics only began publishing this data publicly in May, and it suggests around 8.5 per cent of the population have had coronavirus already. It took months for officials to get tests available to use and they have been accused of being slow to act in getting antibody tests set up.But following a flu pandemic in 2009 scientists in Britain had warned that this sort of data was 'critical to inform important national policy decisions'.The paper presented to SAGE said: 'Sero-surveillance is critical to determine population immunity and community infection rates. 'This data cannot be obtained from other sources and is vital to making modelling predictions of the pandemic.' In 2011, the paper said, a pandemic preparedness strategy had highlighted the importance of antibody tests and said they were 'a key surveillance initiative that will be required at the start of any pandemic'.Children just as likely to catch Covid-19, but fewer have symptoms An undated paper reporting data from China revealed that children under the age of 10 appeared to catch the coronavirus at the same rate as adults.But minors were much less likely to show symptoms of Covid-19, or would often have such mild illness that their parents or doctors wouldn't notice it, the scientists said.The paper, composed by scientific advisers to the chief medical officer, said: 'From large datasets in China, it would appear that SARS-CoV-2 affects children and young people at a disproportionately low rate relative to the population.'However new data suggests that children under 10 are infected at the same rates as adults, but may be asymptomatic or too mildly infected to come to medical attention.It added that there was no data on how much children transferred the virus to adults, and they added that the quality of evidence at that point was low.

161,"Mental Health Awareness Week: How to access free and private therapy during lockdown;Whether you're already in therapy or considering seeking help for the first time, these are the steps you can take","May 20, 2020 Wednesday",International,The Independent (United Kingdom),2218,2218,England & Wales,Sarah Young,"Mental Health Awareness Week: How to access free and private therapy during lockdownWhether you're already in therapy or considering seeking help for the first time, these are the steps you can take","The UK has so far spent nine weeks in lockdown, and while the government has started            easing restrictions, the strict measures continue to have a negative impact on many people's            mental health.From health anxiety and social isolation to financial concerns and disruption to daily routines, almost every aspect of life has been impacted by the coronavirus crisis and left many fighting feelings of stress, depression and loneliness;            figures from the Office of National Statistics show nearly half of Brits are suffering with anxiety.For those who need urgent psychiatric care, or are experiencing a mental health crisis, there are still options to see NHS staff face-to-face (albeit with extra measures in place). You can find your local NHS urgent mental health 24-hour helpline here. But what about for others looking for support?""While many people will recover naturally from the experience of Covid-19 with support from friends and family, a significant proportion of people will need help with unresolved loss, bereavement and the effects of social isolation, loneliness, relationship breakdown as a result of the pandemic,"" Hadyn Williams, chief executive of the British Association for Counselling and Psychotherapy (BACP) tells The Independent.""We would expect to see the numbers of people seeking therapy increase in time, as the situation progresses and moves on from the initial phase of shock and denial. The mental health consequences of this pandemic will affect many people for a long time, and it's vital that they can access therapy when they need it.""Getting mental health care is especially important right now but with clinics forced to close their doors in line with government guidelines, is it still possible to access support? And if so, what is the best route to take?Whether you are already in therapy and concerned about moving forward, or you are considering seeking help for the very first time, here is everything you need to know.                                            Is coronavirus causing more people to access therapy?                                        According to a recent study of almost 2,000 people, conducted by the BACP, counsellors are seeing an increase in people seeking therapy due to the pandemic, as they struggle to cope with its effects in addition to the variety of other reasons for which people normally seek help.The research showed that 98.6 per cent of counsellors say coronavirus has come up in therapy with both new and regular clients, and that the most common effects of coronavirus on their clients' mental health have been social isolation (77.6 per cent), concerns about important people in their lives becoming ill (74 pre cent), distress over watching the news (64.2 pre cent) and financial problems surrounding income in their household (62.8 per cent).Despite a surge in the number of people reaching out for help, the Royal College of Psychiatrists has warned that mental health services could be            overwhelmed by a ""tsunami"" of referrals when the lockdown measures end.Professor Wendy Burn, president of the Royal College of Psychiatrists said: ""We are already seeing the devastating impact of Covid-19 on mental health with more people in crisis.""But we are just as worried about the people who need help now but aren't getting it.""                                            Can you still access free therapy through the NHS during lockdown and how long is the waitlist?                                        The most effective way to access free therapy in the UK is through your GP, who can help you decide what type of therapy may be best for you and refer you to an appropriate local service, which is usually offered through the Improving Access to Psychological Therapies (IAPT) programme says Fiona Ballantine-Dykes, deputy chief executive of the BACP.Most GP surgeries are offering telephone or video consultations due to the current pandemic and you should use your appointment to be honest and open, and explain how you have been feeling.Waiting times for counselling across the NHS will vary, however Dr Michael Sinclair, consultant psychologist and clinical director of the City Psychology Group, says there is a concerted effort to keep waiting times low and support such (mental health) patients as soon as possible.""For more serious cases (depending on presentation) which require secondary care intervention, then the GP referral to subsequent appointment taking place is typically between one to three weeks,"" Sinclair explains. If you were already receiving therapy before lockdown, the best thing to do is to speak to your counsellor about what happens now and how you continue with therapy given the current situation. ""It's a decision you need to make together,"" says Ballantine-Dykes. ""There's not one definitive answer that will be applicable for every client and counsellor, so discussing the situation with your therapist is vital.""                                            How are counselling sessions being conducted?                                        In line with government guidelines, clinics are closed at present, so you won't be able to have an in-person session with a mental health professional.However, Ballantine-Dykes states that many counsellors have adapted quickly to working online or by telephone, even if that is not a service they previously offered.For the most part, video-conferencing applications, such as Zoom,            VSee and            Doxy.me are being            widely used by online therapists but this can vary depending on the counsellors ""style"" of therapy.Rosie Weatherley, information content manager at mental health charity Mind, says it is also important for the person seeking help to ensure they are comfortable receiving therapy in this way. ""Remote appointments can cause us extra anxiety, especially if we're not used to talking to people via video or phone,"" she explains. ""If the technology is going to be problematic for you, or if you feel more comfortable using the phone rather than an online platform, ask your healthcare professional if your appointment can take place via the phone.""Weatherley adds that people should make sure they are in a confidential space during a remote counselling session. If you live with others, go to a different room if possible so you won't be overheard and if you have any concerns, talk this through with your healthcare professional.                                            What other free therapy options are available?                                        If you are faced with a long waiting time for therapy on the NHS, there are other routes you can try. The first is through work.Many employers are recognising the importance of promoting staff wellbeing during lockdown and are implementing initiatives such as Employee Assistance Programmes (EAPs), which enable staff to access confidential 24-hour telephone support and therapy sessions.                     ""There are increasing numbers of workers experiencing stress, anxiety and depression as a direct consequence of their job,"" says Kris Ambler, workforce lead at the BACP. ""We believe employers have both a moral and legal duty of care to their employees. This extends to their physical and psychological wellbeing and should include the provision of support, including talking therapies.""Similarly, if you are a student, many universities and colleges offer counselling and wellbeing care, and are adapting their services to best support students during the pandemic. As a first step, students should contact their universities' wellbeing and support teams to check what help is available. ""Across the UK universities and colleges are recognising the uncertainty that covid-19 has created for our students,"" says Mark Fudge, a university counsellor and chair of the BACP's University and Colleges Division. ""As yet we're unsure of the emotional impact in the longer term, but at present services have responded to the significant changes and continue to support students digitally, or by telephone - whether they're still residing in halls of residence or have returned to their homes.""                     We're unsure of the emotional impact in the longer term                   There are also charities - including local Mind and            Rethink Mental Illness branches - which offer free or low-cost therapy treatments, however the availability of these can vary significantly between locations. Mental Health Matters (MHM) offers a telephone counselling service and talking therapies in some areas and you can also contact Mind's InfoLine to see what services are available in your area.

It also offers a parents helpline on 0808 802 5544                                            Is private therapy an option and how much does it cost?                                          Just like NHS therapists, private counsellors are playing a crucial frontline role in supporting people whose mental health and wellbeing has been affected in different ways during the coronavirus crisis and have adapted quickly to offering therapy online during the lockdown.Opting for private therapy does enable you to choose your own counsellor, which is limited on the NHS, however the obvious downside is that you have to pay for it, and for many people, that is not an option.Celebrities including will.i.am, Laura Whitmore and Phillip Schofield star in Mental Health Awareness Week videoAccording to Ballantine-Dykes, private therapists' charges can vary, costing anything from £35 an hour and more depending on where you live. She explains that some may offer a free initial assessment and possibly reduced costs for people on low income.Sinclair agrees, adding that some people can also use private healthcare insurance to fund their treatment as most health insurances companies will fund counselling, psychotherapy, cognitive and behavioural therapy and psychological treatment.Where can you find a list of qualified professionals for private therapy?It is important to make sure that the practitioner you choose is registered with a PSA-accredited body, such as BACP. This means you know the counsellor or psychotherapist is highly qualified, adheres to high ethical and practice standard and fulfil continuing professional development requirements. The BACP's website offers a ""Therapist Directory"" which only lists profiles for counsellors and psychotherapists who are BACP members. Sinclair adds that are various other trusteed lists and directories of qualified professionals, including counsellors, psychotherapists and psychologists online, including:            Counselling Directory,            Psychology Today,            The British Association of Behavioural and Cognitive Psychotherapy (BABCP),            The British Psychological Society (BPS) and            The Association of Contextual and Behavioural Science (ACBS).What should you do if you or a friend needs urgent help? If you're feeling like you might attempt suicide, or you have seriously harmed yourself, it is an emergency. You should call 999 for an ambulance. ""The NHS still wants you to do this during the coronavirus outbreak,"" Weatherly insists. ""Mental health emergencies are serious. You are not wasting anyone's time.""If you need to talk, there are people ready to listen. You can call            Samaritans any time on 116 123.            Shout also offers a free 24/7 crisis text service. Text SHOUT to 85258. Advice for people on a waiting listIf you are finding that you are on a long-waiting list, Weatherley says there aresome things you can try to explore while you wait for your therapy sessions to begin: •Reach out to a telephone support service. You could try to talk to a helpline or listening service about your mental health.•Self-help books. Your GP might recommend particular titles from a Reading Well scheme called 'Books on Prescription'.•Peer support. This brings people together who've shared similar experiences and can empathise with what you're going through. Many peer support groups take place online, including Mind's Elefriends.•Try to keep active. Build physical activity into your daily routine, if possible. Most of us don't have exercise equipment like treadmills where we live, but there are still activities you can do. Exercising at home can be simple and there are options for most ages and abilities, such as cleaning your home, dancing to music or seated exercises.•Find ways to relax and be creative. There are lots of different ways that you can relax, take notice of the present moment and use your creative side. These include arts and crafts, DIY, mindfulness, writing, yoga and medication.You can find more tips about managing your mental health and wellbeing during the coronavirus outbreak here.

""The RCMP's Behavioural Analysis Unit is conducting a psychological autopsy of the gunman, with the intent of gathering insights into why he committed the acts of violence. This includes an analysis of his personality, past behaviour and how he related to others,"" said the statement.The technique, which involves extensive in-depth interviews with friends, family and colleagues, has been used for nearly 70 years, often to determine motives behind suicides. But the practice can also provide clarity in cases of mass murder.""These are much more than police inquiries,"" clinical and forensic psychologist Antoon Leenaars told the Canadian Press. ""They are investigations of the mind.""Leenaars, who wrote the 2017 book, The Psychological Autopsy, said the aim of the investigation is to construct a robust and detailed portrait of an individual, with the hope of providing clues as to why they acted in a particular way.""Given what this was designed for, I think this would be a perfect situation ... That evidence can be extremely helpful in terms of trying to understand what happened,"" said Leenaars.The psychological autopsy is part of a sweeping police investigation, which includes analysis of 17 separate crime scenes. The RCMP said they used ""ground penetrating radar"" to scan the gunman's property to determine if anything of importance was buried, but found nothing.Police also announced an update on the firearms - two semiautomatic handguns and two semiautomatic rifles - used by the gunman.""One of the guns has been traced to Canada. The remaining guns that were recovered are believed to have been obtained in the United States,"" they said.After the shooting, the prime minister, Justin Trudeau, announced           a ban on 1,500 models of ""military grade assault weapons"" last week - a move that has come under fire in recent days for loopholes that would allow gun owners to continue possessing the firearms.For much of his deadly spree, the gunman disguised himself as an RCMP officer, using parts of an authentic uniform and a replica police vehicle to evade capture and to lure victims.Police said on Monday that the decals used on the shooter's vehicle were created by an individual at a decal company without permission from the owner. Both the individual who made the decal, and the owner, are cooperating with police.Police said on Monday they had spoken to 500 witnesses and are continuing to conduct interviews, asking anyone who had a ""professional or personal"" conflict with the gunman to come forward.",Newspaper
163,"Walk this way! How to optimise your stride and focus your mind to get the most from your daily stroll;Lockdown has reminded us of the pleasures of walking. But making small changes can boost its benefits to our health, mood and creativity, too","May 28, 2020 Thursday",International,The Guardian (London),1373,1373,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,Amy Fleming,"Walk this way! How to optimise your stride and focus your mind to get the most from your daily strollLockdown has reminded us of the pleasures of walking. But making small changes can boost its benefits to our health, mood and creativity, too","As a form of physical activity, it is easy to dismiss walking as, well, pedestrian. But now its benefits, both physical and mental, are being appreciated once again. Under lockdown, daily walks became sacred. Now they are the safest way to commute, and, for those stuck at home, there is little place else to go other than to wander the streets, forests, towpaths, cemeteries and eerily deserted business quarters.We have become nosy tourists in our own neighbourhoods. We seek out less-travelled backwaters, eyeing curiously the fragments of human and animal lives that we pass, gazing on seasonal changes like besotted new parents. But are we walking to the best of our abilities? Possibly not. Sports scientist Joanna Hall has dedicated her career to coaching people in how to walk the way their bodies were designed to, which no longer comes easily in this sedentary, screen-based era.""I approach this as you would do if you wanted to get better at tennis,"" she says. She developed her Walk Active programme to enable people to ease their aches and pains as they exercise, rather than exacerbate them. Lifestyle, ageing and injuries mean that when we put one foot in front of the other, the way we use our muscles may be, she says, ""suboptimal for improving our posture, or reducing joint strain and getting the most out of walking"".According to Hall, there are four common aspects we get wrong, and each has knock-on effects on the body. Firstly, instead of propelling ourselves forwards by pushing off with the back foot, like an ice-skater, we try to use our stepping foot to power us along. This is because sitting down too much has made our hip flexor muscles short and tight. Hall describes the necessary adjustment as the subtle difference between stepping into a space (wrong) and pushing off from a space, which will recruit the right muscles up the backs of your legs. ""You use your glutes and you open up the core,"" says Hall.The second problem is what Hall calls a passive foot strike. The movement provided by the joints in our feet offers suspension and balance but we often plod along flatly instead, leaving us compromised. ""That's what causes knee discomfort,"" says Hall. ""It can create slight misalignment of the back, stiffness of the shoulders.""The third thing to watch out for is letting your head hang forwards. Screens, reading and desk work have made this the default position, which is a bit of a disaster. ""When the head is slightly forward,"" says Hall, ""the muscles of the upper back and the shoulders have to contract to hold it there. The shoulders come forward and can stiffen. Back mobility becomes restricted and you will not be able to rotate your spine from the hips."" Try lifting your head before looking over your shoulder and you may discover, as I did, that you can turn your head much further all of a sudden.Finally, our arms tend to hang awkwardly or we force them into tense, power-walk movements, when what they want is to dangle freely. If you get steps one to three right, this should happen naturally. Hall has devised various drills to help correct these bad habits, such as measuring with your hand the gap between your bottom rib and your hip, and between your collarbone and your earlobe, and then adjusting your posture to lengthen those gaps. Walking with her tips in mind has made me feel lighter; more gazelle than galumph.Now that lockdown rules have eased, we can get some desperately needed time with friends or family members. Yes, not being allowed to hug is painful, but physically distanced walking together is the next best thing. This is because when two people walk together, they unconsciously fall into step. As a 2012 study by US and Japanese researchers found, when people move in sync together, their neural activity synchronises too. The more in sync we are, the deeper our social connection, so walking in step is pretty much a physically distanced hug.Walking has long been hailed as an aid to creativity, too, by big thinkers from Aristotle to Wordsworth to Stanford University behavioural scientist Marily Ann Oppezzo. In 2018, Oppezzo and her colleagues, who study creativity, published research that set out to demonstrate this lightbulb effect. Participants who brainstormed while walking thought of significantly more valid ideas than those who tried to do the same while sitting.So if you have to attend a (socially-distanced) brainstorming meeting, says Oppezzo, ""go think about ideas beforehand while walking."" Brainstorming in groups, she says, is far less productive.If you need to maximise the potential of a creative walk - perhaps you are finally starting that novel while quarantining - she suggests picking a problem or topic beforehand and thinking about potential new perspectives on it while you walk. Rather than taking a ""deep dive"", she says, walking is great for taking a stroll around a subject, seeing it from different sides and coming up with new ideas.She recommends travelling at a comfortable pace, so your physical exertion needs minimal attention, and coming up with as many ideas as you can, rather than trying to lock on to the first one you have. And if the ideas aren't flowing, don't force it. Come back to it another time.Crucially, in the study, she had participants record their ideas, rather than write them down, ""because the idea of writing something down is already a filter - is this good enough to write down? You can put your headphones on and record through your phone."" And if you are feeling self-conscious, the headphones allow you to pretend to passers-by that you're having a phone conversation.As well as percolating the cerebral juices, there are powerful mental-health benefits to be gained from walking. Half an hour of walking per day has been found to be as helpful as more intense 20-minute workouts in treating depression.            Hugh O'Donovan, a psychologist based in Cork, wrote about the beneficial effects in his 2015 book Mindful Walking: Walk Your Way to Mental and Physical Well-Being. Walking provides what he calls ""natural meds"", and there are no rules. Do you want to walk alone or with others? Do you listen to music or the outside world? Right now, enjoying the variety of options is key. ""You have different locations and different routes,"" says O'Donovan. ""You can pick up the pace when you like, or you can slow down and be a bit more mindful. It doesn't really matter. It's just the fact that you're doing it.""To reinforce the positive effects, he suggests ""experimenting with noticing how you're feeling. Is it lifting my mood? Am I meeting people and socialising a little?"" However you prefer to walk, he invites you to ""come to your senses. This is profoundly important because much of the time we're on autopilot. We're unconscious, unaware of what's going on around us. There's magic all around us all the time but we're too busy."" Coronavirus has slowed life down, perhaps making it a little easier to pay attention. ""What are you seeing, smelling, tasting?"" he asks. ""The world looks like a completely different place when you bring this quality of curiosity to everything you do. People underestimate its value.""While walking helps oil the cogs of the mind, and can help you get perspective if you're struggling with something seismic such as grief, a job loss or the uncertainty of life under Covid-19, it pays to be aware of the risks of rumination. Namely, says O'Donovan, ""the error and bias that's associated with thinking, which lead us down a slippery slope into catastrophising and predicting the future negatively."" How can you avoid repeating the unhelpful and yet perfectly natural response, ""why me?"" or ""why this?"" Ask instead, says O'Donovan, ""what now?"" Walking can help with this. ""The world opens up in a different way when we lift our mood, when we don't fall into the hole.""Your best chance to stay in contention, as I call it, is to be mindful about what's going on in the world,"" he continues. ""It might seem like it's very dark at the moment, but there's lots of good stuff going on too. Focus on what kind of a story you choose to tell. And, by getting out, moving and keeping your energy up, you have the possibility of telling a more positive story.""",Newspaper
164,"What it will take to guard Harry and Meghan;The Duke and Duchess of Sussex are paying a fortune for security in America - the price is astronomical for a good reason, a bodyguard to the A-listers tells Julia Llewellyn Smith","June 3, 2020 Wednesday",International,The Times (London),1271,1271,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,Julia Llewellyn Smith,"What it will take to guard Harry and MeghanThe Duke and Duchess of Sussex are paying a fortune for security in America - the price is astronomical for a good reason, a bodyguard to the A-listers tells Julia Llewellyn Smith","They have their £14 million Beverly Hills mansion and blossoming friendships with Oprah and the Clooneys, so naturally when it came to picking a security team the Duke and Duchess of Sussex went for the A-listers' favourite, Gavin de Becker, described by the actor Michael J Fox as a ""secret service for famous people.""Based in a warehouse in suburban Los Angeles, Gavin de Becker and Associates claims to protect ""over 90 of the world's most prominent families and at-risk individuals"", believed to include, at various times, the Beckhams, Jeff Bezos, Madonna, Cher, John Travolta and Barbra Streisand.Aged 65, de Becker is a celebrity in his own right, owing to his bestselling memoir The Gift of Fear, detailing his childhood with a violent, heroinaddict mother. His team was already employed by the Sussexes' landlord, the Hollywood tycoon Tyler Perry, to safeguard the eight-bedroom property, which has already been targeted by drones, probably flown by paparazzi.""De Becker is a publicity fiend and he's the bodyguard du jour. He'll already be doing security for all Harry and Meghan's celebrity buddies, who will have said, 'Oh, Gavin's the best.' "" one Hollywood insider says.With their British taxpayer-funded security believed to have lapsed when the couple stepped down from the royal family at the end of March, the couple are estimated to be looking at a bill of about £7,000 a day (£2.5 million a year) for de Becker's services.For that they will be provided with a team of about six bodyguards working in rotation, with four on duty by day and two at night. They may include former intelligence officers from the FBI and CIA officers, former US Marines and Rangers and LAPD officers, as well as behavioural scientists specialising in threat assessment.Some of them will be in charge of supervising household security, others in providing close protection when, for example - at some point in the future - the couple visit a restaurant. ""The principal concern right now will be avoiding the rioting. Everyone I know in LA is working overtime to work out which routes are clear for their clients and which aren't,"" says Will Geddes, who runs the London-based International Corporate Protection, which has a core team of about 30 in London and 600 worldwide, guarding dozens of rock stars, royals, billionaires and film stars.""Normally the biggest nightmare in LA is paparazzi shoving cameras in faces and chasing your principal [client] down the street,"" Geddes continues. ""Then there's the problem of stalkers, or 'fixated persons' as we call them. I don't know for sure if Meghan and Harry have any, but it's fairly likely given that LA is chock-full of nutters.""The most pressing issue for security firms is, of course, Covid-19. ""Initially our industry ground to a halt.Everyone was in lockdown, terrified of catching coronavirus from their security - after all, they're called close-protection officers - and obviously we didn't want our guys catching corona from a principal,"" says Geddes, 54, who won't name clients, but has been seen publicly with Vanessa-Mae, Jon Bon Jovi, Jack Black, Eva Herzigova and Jermaine Jackson (""There are much bigger names, but I can't tell you"").Now, after long consultations with medics and scientists and implementing rigorous, regular testing programmes for both parties, Geddes is busy enabling clients' return to work. ""I'm just helping a very wellknown pop star to get back recording in the studio with their collaborators.""Geddes charges £350 an hour or £3,000 a day for his personal services, but he won't work with just anyone. ""I have turned down some huge names because I wasn't convinced things wouldn't blow up somewhere down the line,"" he says.""You have to be sure there's a good level of compromise, that you can facilitate the principal's needs and keep them safe and that they treat their security sensibly and respectably. There's one A-lister who has a track record for infuriating security by driving off and losing their team, withholding information - that would drive you mad. If a job is destined to fail, you have to walk away from it.""There's undoubtedly a touch of James Bond to Geddes, who, single and child-free, lives in Mayfair, likes tailored suits and drives fancy cars (his last was an Aston Martin). Unlike most of his colleagues he has no military background, but began his career running self-defence courses for employees of big corporations and has completed some grisly missions in Iraq and Afghanistan, negotiating with al-Qaeda and Islamic State.Yet, he says, a great deal of his job is mundane. ""We say 99 per cent is boredom and 1 per cent is really exciting, and that is how it should be. If you've done your planning around those flashpoint situations - checking out a restaurant or a private home in advance of a visit - then there should be minimum risk. It's when something hasn't happened for an awfully long time that your guard drops, but that tends not to happen with the most experienced people; we have what we call a long-developed 'spidey sense' for danger.""Clients have always risked kidnapping and robbery, but today those risks have rocketed thanks to celebrities' proclivity for revealing their whereabouts and riches on social media. Take the case of Kim Kardashian, who was robbed of jewellery worth millions of pounds at gunpoint in a Paris hotel in 2016, while her bodyguard of four years was out supervising her sisters in a nightclub. He is now being sued for nearly £5 million by Kardashian's insurance company.""In that incident both were at fault: her for flaunting her jewellery on Instagram and him for leaving her unattended,"" Geddes believes. ""You see this far too often with 'celebrity' bodyguards. They're too eager to appease the client rather than standing by the standards and levels that should be in place."" Often this comes down to budget restrictions. ""Even the richest families don't usually want to spend too much on their security, but you can't expect a platinum solution with tinfoil.""By that token, problems often arise when clients stretch staff too thinly or ask them to carry out tasks beyond their brief, such as running errands. Last year £50 million worth of jewellery was stolen from Tamara Ecclestone's mansion shortly after she and her family went on holiday. One guard, employed by de Becker, who was supposed to have been on the property at all times, is alleged to have gone out to fill the family car with petrol, while another, in the security room where the CCTV is monitored, appeared to miss footage of robbers climbing over a fence into the garden.In general, Geddes says, the bigger the name, the easier a celebrity is to handle. ""It's the same with ultra-high-net-worth individuals; they're the most charming people as they have nothing left to prove.It's the ones who are worth up to £50 million who are really difficult.""Geddes foresees de Becker's officers having few problems with Prince Harry - who, after all, has lived with bodyguards all his life.""I've never protected Harry, but I've bumped into him.

165,BBQs and garden parties for friends and family 'bubbles' of 10 will get green light next month as UK lockdown edges towards the end - after Boris Johnson announced all shops will reopen within weeks,"May 26, 2020 Tuesday",International,MailOnline,3613,3613,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,James Robinson for MailOnline,BBQs and garden parties for friends and family 'bubbles' of 10 will get green light next month as UK lockdown edges towards the end - after Boris Johnson announced all shops will reopen within weeks,"•Small outdoor social gatherings of up to 10 people could be allowed next month•Outdoor markets and car showrooms will now be able to reopen from June 1•Independent shops and department stores will be able to reopen from June 15•But government warns shops will have to adhere to social distancing guidance                     Britons hoping to crack out the coals for a summer barbecue with friends and family could get the opportunity to as early as next month, it was revealed today.Small outdoor gatherings, including barbecues and garden parties, which have been banned since the start of lockdown, could be the next measures to be eased, according to reports.The proposals, said to be brought up by Boris Johnson at a cabinet meeting yesterday, could be part of a wider plan to introduce 'social bubbles' as a way of giving people more social contact during lockdown, reports the Daily Telegraph.A 'social bubble' scheme, already being used in New Zealand, which has had 21 coronavirus-related deaths compared to the UK's 37,000, would allow groups of up to 10 people to mix outdoors.The announcement comes as Boris Johnson last night paved the way for the 'sale of the century' as he gave the go-ahead for high street businesses to reopen - with retailers expected to slash prices in order to clear their stock which has been mothballed since the coronavirus lockdown began.Meanwhile, the government is reportedly open to the idea of 'social bubbles', with the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (SAGE) understood to have advised top ministers that infection from Covid-19 is much less likely outdoors.[related]A spokesperson for the Prime Minister told The Telegraph that No 10 was 'open to the idea' of social bubbles saying the Government was 'alive to the issue of social isolation and the need for mental wellbeing'.Pub bosses urge government to ditch two metre social distancing rule to allow them to reopen Pub bosses are urging ministers to change social distancing rules so they can open up once again, according to reports.They want the social distancing guidelines changed from keeping people two metres apart down to one metre apart to allow them to reopen.Pubs have been shut since since lockdown began on March 23, and despite the government's initial hopes of a June reopening, may not be able to open again until July.But some pubs bosses are warning that they are too small to practically carry out social distancing, and will therefore have to remain closed.Brewery chiefs say a one-metre rule would increase the number of pubs that could open by 120 per cent, according to The Sun.Emma McClarkin, head of the British Beer and Pub Association, told the paper: 'We are all missing the great British pub. 'We are working day in, day out alongside the Government to create a safe socialising environment for our staff and customers to return to.'Pubs with gardens should be in a great position to reopen at the earliest opportunity, and we hope that the Government will look again at revising the social distancing guidance.'Last night, the Prime Minister gave all retail stores the green light to lift the shutters on June 15, as he attempted to bring the coronavirus-battered UK High Street back to life.Speaking at the daily Covid-19 briefing at Downing Street yesterday, he also gave the go-ahead for non-essential shops, including department stores and independent businesses, to reopen from June 15.Outdoor markets and car showrooms will be allowed to reopen from June 1 as long as they adhere to strict social distancing guidelines. The move will provide a welcome boost for businesses forced to close in March at a huge financial cost to themselves and to the Treasury, which has spent hundreds of billions of pounds keeping them afloat and their staff paid. But the announcement came as Mr Johnson faces massive political pressure to sack his chief aide Dominic Cummings. The timing is likely to fuel suspicion among politician opponents that he has pulled this positive news out of his hat to deflect attention from the huge political fallout.The reopening is likely to spark a sales frenzy as shops try to emerge from the pandemic-induced wreckage of the economy, while consumers will be glad to leave the house.Analysts believe there could be as much as £15billion-worth of stock which needs to be sold, meaning there will be 'wall-to-wall' sales until January. But because of movement restrictions it is unlikely to be an immediate free-for-all - and hospitality businesses like pubs and restaurants will remain closed. [item name=video id=4368678 style=2 /]That comes amid calls from pub bosses to cut the social distancing measures from two metres to a metre to allow watering holes to reopen once again.

'For many this will be an entirely new way of operating as they apply guidance to the practical realities of their business.' Speaking at the conference tonight, Mr Johnson said: 'Today I want to put the retail sector on notice of our intention to reopen shops so they can get ready to reopen. 'So I can announce that it is our intention to allow outdoor markets to reopen on June 1, subject to premises being Covid secure, as well as car showrooms which often have sufficient out door space.'From June 15 we intend to allow all other non-essential retail, ranging from department stores to small independent shops to reopen.'We will set out our formal assessment of the five tests that we set for adjusting the lockdown later this week as part of the three-weekly review we are legally required to undertake by Thursday.'But because of the progress we are making I can, with confidence, put the British people on notice of the changes we intend to introduce as we move to step two. 'We know that the transmission of the virus is lower outdoors and that it is easier to follow Covid secure guidelines in open spaces.' Mr Johnson added that the government will today publish social distancing guidelines to help shops become 'Covid secure' before reopening.He said: 'This will ensure there can be no doubt about what steps should be taken.'We will of course have powers to enforce these conditions, where it is required.'Mr Johnson also put emphasis on consumers to keep safe themselves, by repeating his new 'wash your hands, keep your distance' slogan.He added: 'We will only be successful if we all remember the basics - so wash your hands, keep social distance, and isolate if you have symptoms - and get a test.' [item name=video id=4368674 style=2 /]The boost to retail comes as official data, released earlier this week, showed how retail sales plummeted by nearly a fifth last month as Britons stopped buying fuel and clothing amid lockdown.Slash social distancing to 3ft to allow up to 120% more pubs to reopen, urge UK landlords who say smaller venues without beer gardens will struggle to keep 6ft gap between drinkers  Pubs in Britain have urged the Government to relax the two-metre (6ft) social distancing rule during the coronavirus pandemic so they can reopen.Brewery bosses claim many pubs are too small to successfully enforce the stringent measures.They say halving the recommended distance to one metre (3ft) would mean 120 per cent more pubs would be able to reopen when safe to do so.Pubs have been shut since March 20 - just before the start of the lockdown - but the Government has said they hope to reopen them in July.Safety tactics such as protective screens, one-way systems and apps for ordering pints have been discussed by pub owners as possible ways to prevent coronavirus transmission, reported The Sun .But smaller pubs are worried that the two-metre social distancing rule will mean they cannot accept enough customers to keep them in business.It comes as industry experts estimate pubs lost ten million pint sales over the sunny Bank Holiday weekend.Emma McClarkin, head of the British Beer and Pub Association, told The Sun: 'We are all missing the great British pub.'We are working day in, day out alongside the Government to create a safe socialising environment for our staff and customers to return to.'Pubs with gardens should be in a great position to reopen at the earliest opportunity, and we hope that the Government will look again at revising the social distancing guidance.'The two-metre distancing rule is based on the fact that droplets from sneezes and coughs can travel anywhere between one and two metres.While Britain has strictly maintained a two-metre rule, many other countries such as France have only ever imposed a one-metre rule. The record plunge of 18.1 per cent month-on-month underlines the massive hit to the economy from coronavirus chaos. Full lockdown was imposed by the government on March 23, with non-essential shops ordered to shut.In the first full month after the draconian curbs were introduced, clothing sales volumes were hit by a 50.2 per cent drop - having already seen a fall of 34.9 per cent in March.Meanwhile, fuel saw a 52 per cent reduction, and food sales were down as the stockpiling frenzy eased, according to official figures.One of the few areas to see an increase was off-licence sales, which were up 2.3 per cent on the month.This could be due to the inability of Britons to go to pubs and bars - which are still set to remain shut beyond the date given by the government for the reopening of retail stores.Punters had been given hope of a return to pubs and bars on June 1, after the government suggested the data for the reopening of watering holes across Britain.But earlier this week, Ralph Findlay, chief executive of brewing giant Marston's, which owns 1,400 premises, said any move to reopen establishments was at least five weeks off.Meanwhile, almost all store types saw record online spending in April, the ONS said, as many retailers shifted to online-only trading.The only sectors to see an increase in volume of sales last month were non-store retailing such as online and catalogue businesses, up 18 per cent on the previous month, and off licences.Meanwhile, an industry insider has claimed warehouse storage space for high street retailers is more than 90 per cent full, meaning shops have reportedly been storing summer fashion in railway sidings and on former Ministry of Defence land - and it could spark a mass of sales. M&S's price cuts will be as much as 50 per cent in what the outlet is billing as a 'rainbow sale'. Ten per cent of the store's takings will go to NHS charities.Already, the firm is advertising online price cuts of up to 30 per cent on items including men's shirts and women's footwear and linen.However, some shirts are being sold on the firm's website with price reductions of nearly 50 per cent.Topshop, Miss Selfridge and French Connection are also advertising discounts of up to 50 per cent, though some items of clothing are listed with even bigger reductions.Some women's vests being sold on the Miss Selfridge website are advertised at just £3, down from the normal price of £10. Retail analyst Richard Hyman believes there will be 'wall-to-wall promotions for the rest of the year.'He estimates that between £10billion and £15billion worth of spring and summer clothes are sitting in shops and warehouses.Earlier today, official government figures showed there had been 121 more deaths related to coronavirus across all settings, taking the official death toll to almost 37,000. It marks the lowest Monday death toll since the UK's draconian lockdown was enforced on March 23 (74 deaths).For comparison, 160 fatalities were announced last Monday and 118 were recorded yesterday.But officials warn that death numbers released on Sundays and Mondays are usually significantly smaller due to a delay in processing fatalities over the weekend.Department of Health chiefs also announced 1,625 more Covid-19 cases today, the first time the UK has recorded fewer than 2,000 positive tests in the space of 24 hours in almost nine weeks. Separate figures showed 8,800 Brits are currently in hospital being treated for coronavirus - down 12 per cent in a week. The Prime Minister's announcement in the Downing Street press conference tonight came after his aide Dominic Cummings refused to apologise for driving 260 miles to Durham during the coronavirus lockdown.Vote Leave maverick Mr Cummings - who is facing calls to be sacked - faced accusations of 'double standards' but he told a press conference in the Number 10 Rose Garden: 'I don't regret what I did.'In other developments to Britain's coronavirus crisis today:•Britons descended on parks and beaches amid an expected 79F heatwave as they declared, 'If Dominic Cummings can break the rules, we can too';•An NHS hospital in the Somerset seaside hotspot of Weston-super-Mare was forced to stop taking new patients due to a high number of coronavirus cases;•Newsreader Simon McCoy slammed his BBC colleague Gary Lineker for abusing his position after the Match of the Day host accused the Prime Minister of lying;•Schools face a long journey before they are able to return to normal, Education Secretary Gavin Williamson said as he insisted classes must restart on June 1.The Department of Health's daily death toll means the rolling seven-day average of victims has dropped to just 303 - the lowest since March 31 (274) and less than a third of the peak on April 14 (943).It takes the overall official number of victims to 36,914 - but the true number is thousands higher because it only takes into account laboratory-confirmed cases, not the suspected deaths in other settings.Of the 121 new deaths, 76 occurred in hospitals - most of which were in England. The remainder of the newly recorded Covid-19 fatalities happened in other settings, such as care homes.England recorded 104 deaths, followed by nine in Scotland, seven in Wales and one in Northern Ireland - tallies that do not match up with the individual counts recorded by each of the home nations.For instance, Scotland's own health chiefs today announced three new deaths but yesterday recorded seven. Northern Ireland had the same issue, recording eight new fatalities today but only one yesterday.The issue is only thought to occur with Scotland and Northern Ireland because of a difference in how the data is collected. Wales announced seven new deaths today and yesterday.NHS England figures also do not match the individual tally collated by the Department of Health for England (104) because the official toll includes deaths across all settings, not just in hospitals.                     CUMMINGS REFUSES TO APOLOGISE FOR DRIVING TO DURHAM DURING CORONAVIRUS LOCKDOWN                     Dominic Cummings today refused to apologise for driving 260 miles to Durham during the coronavirus lockdown as he claimed he had always behaved 'reasonably and legally' amid growing calls for the PM's top aide to be sacked.Mr Cummings said his decision to travel to the city to stay in a cottage on his parents' land was the result of a 'very complicated, tricky situation' as he admitted he had not sought Boris Johnson's permission to make the journey at the end of March.The Vote Leave maverick has faced accusations of 'double standards', with the nation having been told to stay at home, but he told an unprecedented press conference in the Number 10 Rose Garden: 'I don't regret what I did... I think what I did was reasonable in the circumstances.'Asked directly if he had offered to quit or had even considered it, he added: 'No I have not offered to resign, no I have not considered it.' Mr Cummings conceded that 'reasonable people may well disagree' with his chosen course of action but he was resolute in his belief that he had acted in an appropriate manner and had not broken the rules.He insisted 'I don't think there is one rule for me and one rule for other people' and blamed public anger at media reports 'that have not been true'.The usually scruffy adviser was wearing an open collared shirt as he confirmed that he had travelled to the town of Barnard Castle on April 12 after the end of his period in self-isolation with coronavirus.He insisted he and his family had not walked around the town 30 miles from Durham and had only ventured 15 metres from the car to the river bank. He said the purpose of the journey was to see if he was fit enough to make the drive back to London.He also said that he and his family had walked around a woods during their stay in Durham but that they were within his parents' private property and that they had not come into contact with anyone else.Meanwhile, he claimed he did not stop for fuel on the way up to Durham but he had stopped once on the way back.He said: 'Yesterday I gave a full account to the Prime Minister of my actions between March 27 and April 14, what I thought and did.And the two use different measures for hospital deaths, with the DH relying on data from Public Health England, which uses several sources to provide an update every afternoon.The figures published today by NHS England confirm that April 8 was still the peak of the crisis, with 891 hospital deaths recorded - up from the 59 that were announced today by NHS England.Of the 59 new deaths recorded in England's hospitals, 47 occurred over the weekend. Five took place on Friday, while the remaining seven victims succumbed to the disease between May 16 and 21.It comes as Dominic Cummings this afternoon made a public statement to directly address claims he broke lockdown rules by travelling to Durham, Downing Street confirmed. The Prime Minister's chief adviser today refused to apologise for driving 260 miles to Durham during the coronavirus lockdown as he claimed he had always behaved 'reasonably and legally' amid growing calls for the PM's top aide to be sacked. Mr Cummings said his decision to travel to the city to stay in a cottage on his parents' land was the result of a 'very complicated, tricky situation' as he admitted he had not sought Boris Johnson's permission to make the journey at the end of March.The Vote Leave maverick has faced accusations of 'double standards', with the nation having been instructed to stay at home, but he told an unprecedented press conference in the Number 10 Rose Garden: 'I don't regret what I did... I think what I did was reasonable in the circumstances.'Asked directly if he had offered to quit or had even considered it, he added: 'No I have not offered to resign, no I have not considered it.' The intervention came after one of the government's scientific advisers warned the 'debacle' over the lockdown journey had 'fatally undermined' the nation's fight against coronavirus.Professor Stephen Reicher, who is a member of the Government's advisory group on behavioural science which feeds into SAGE, said the result of 'undermining adherence to the rules' will be that 'more people are going to die'.Mr Johnson is facing a furious backlash from ministers, Tory MPs and even bishops after he yesterday attempted to mount an extraordinary defence of Mr Cummings, staking his reputation on trying to protect his aide.At a dramatic Downing Street press conference last night, the PM claimed Mr Cummings had acted 'responsibly, legally and with integrity' while making a controversial 260-mile trip from London to Durham during lockdown.Mr Johnson insisted Mr Cummings had 'followed the instincts of every father' by driving to his parents' farm after his wife developed symptoms of coronavirus. The PM's defence of his aide prompted fury among Britons. Today, Boris Johnson admitted his top aide Dominic Cummings had created 'confusion, anger and pain' tonight as he again defended him from fury over his breach of lockdown rules.The Prime Minister said Mr Cummings had acted 'legally' at tonight's Downing Street news conference as senior ministers rallied around the beleaguered strategist, but added repeatedly: 'You will have to make up your own minds.'Meanwhile, sun-worshippers descended on parks and beaches today for the Bank Holiday amid an expected 79F heatwave, which could see parts of the country basked in temperatures hotter than Athens, Nice and Barcelona.Crowds formed outside the Serpentine in London's Hyde Park, as beaches in Sussex, Essex and Dorset quickly filled up with visitors looking to enjoy the dry and sunny conditions forecast to last the whole day.",Web Publication

167,Officials 'could only cope with five Covid cases a week',"May 31, 2020",International,The Sunday Telegraph (London),485,485,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,Laura Donnelly ; Tom Morgan,Officials 'could only cope with five Covid cases a week',"BRITAIN'S disastrous decision to abandon testing for coronavirus occurred because health systems could only cope with five cases a week, official documents show.Newly released papers from Sage (the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies) show routine testing and tracing of contacts was stopped because Public Health England's systems were struggling to deal with a handful of cases.At a meeting on Feb 18, advisers said PHE could only cope with testing and tracing contacts of five Covid-19 cases a week, with modelling suggesting it might only be possible to increase this to 50 cases. Advisers then agreed it was ""sensible"" to shift to stopping routine testing, despite acknowledging that such a decision would ""generate a public reaction"".The decision to give up on testing those with symptoms of coronavirus is now seen as the key reason the UK has the highest death rates in Europe.Over the next month the Government will roll out a national contact tracing scheme, 14 weeks after officials raised the country's poor readiness for such a scheme.England is now recording around 8,000 new cases of Covid-19 a day and the NHS ""test and trace"" system is promising to warn up to 10,000 people a day that they have been near someone who has tested positive.The end of routine testing in the UK came on March 12, when Boris Johnson announced that anyone with symptoms of coronavirus should simply stay at home for a week. On this day the UK recorded 421 new cases.However, after the virus raged uncontrolled through the UK that month, ministers were forced back to nationwide testing, announcing a ""five pillar"" plan on April 2, which finally led to a nationwide tracing service launched this week.A desperate initial shortage of capacity to test and trace is detailed among 51 papers released on Friday, including minutes of 34 meetings, which occurred from Jan 22 to May 7.They reveal the crucial decisions which led to the disastrous decision to abandon routine testing - which is only now being ramped back up.Minutes of a key Sage meeting on Feb 18 state: ""Currently PHE can cope with five new cases a week (requiring isolation of 800 contacts). Modelling suggests this capacity could be increased to 50 new cases a week (8,000 contact isolations) but this assumption needs to be stress tested with PHE operational colleagues.""Sage concluded: ""When there is sustained transmission in the UK, contact tracing will no longer be useful.""Two days later, Sage's scientists agreed that plans drawn up for PHE on discontinuing contact tracing are ""sensible"", the minutes show.""Any decision to discontinue contact tracing will generate a public reaction - which requires consideration with input from behavioural scientists,"" the minutes of February 20 note.

168,Scientists criticise 'worrying' plan to 'downgrade' SAGE's role in the Covid-19 fight and give the new Joint Biosecurity Centre a more prominent role,"July 8, 2020 Wednesday",International,MailOnline,1465,1465,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,"Jack Maidment, Deputy Political Editor For MailonlineSam Blanchard Senior Health Reporter For Mailonline",Scientists criticise 'worrying' plan to 'downgrade' SAGE's role in the Covid-19 fight and give the new Joint Biosecurity Centre a more prominent role,"•Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (SAGE) will now meet less frequently•Joint Biosecurity Centre will be handed responsibility for stopping outbreaks•JBC is run by the Department of Health and NHS Test & Trace chief Dido Harding•SAGE was an independent group of scientists who were not paid by governmentThe Government's Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (SAGE) is to see its role in the coronavirus crisis downgraded with the nation's new Joint Biosecurity Centre tasked with doing more of the heavy lifting, it was claimed today. The JBC will take over monitoring the spread of the deadly disease with SAGE now expected to meet less often. The move, first reported by the BBC, has sparked controversy among scientists who say nothing is known about who works for the JBC and fear it will become secretive organisation.Funded by the Department of Health, the Joint Biosecurity Centre, is part of the NHS Test and Trace scheme and ultimately under the control of Baroness Dido Harding. Experts today claimed it would be 'worrying' if the role of SAGE - a panel of top independent scientists who advise the Government for free - was demoted. Amid concerns about transparency SAGE revealed a list of its members and regularly publishes papers from its meetings, which happen behind closed doors with officials in Whitehall. But top researchers fear the JBC would not commit to the same level of openness and that the science behind the Government's decisions would be less clear. A simmering row over the group's covertness broke out in April when it emerged top Downing Street aide Dominic Cummings had attended its meetings. Mr Cummings has already vowed to take an axe to the civil service after the coronavirus exposed flaws in the government machine, it was claimed last month.The JBC is currently tasked with helping the Government's top experts to set the coronavirus threat level, which is at three out of five.It is staffed by epidemiologists and data analysts who will now apparently be tasked with figuring out ways to best identify and stop new outbreaks of the disease.It is headed by Dr Clare Gardiner, a qualified epidemiologist, medical researcher, and cybersecurity director at GCHQ.                      WHAT ARE SAGE AND THE JOINT BIOSECURITY CENTRE?                   SAGE SAGE is the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (SAGE). It is a panel of scientific experts in a variety of fields who are convened to provide advice to ministers and Government officials in the event of an emergency.The members of the panel - except for those representing the Government, including Professor Chris Whitty and Sir Patrick Vallance - are not paid for their involvement.The job of SAGE is to present the latest scientific evidence on a particular subject and to discuss it in round-table meetings to consider how it might influence the Government's policy and decisions.The members of SAGE are not set in stone and change regularly, depending on the nature of the crisis it is responding to. The group is chaired and organised by the Government Office for Science, of which Sir Patrick Vallance is the head. Joint Biosecurity CentreThe Joint Biosecurity Centre is a new organisation set up by the Government in May this year. The JBC has been tasked with monitoring disease outbreaks and has been assisting the nation's chief medical officers in setting the coronavirus threat level. The threat level is measured on a scale of one to five and is currently at three, meaning Covid-19 is 'in general circulation'. Its staff consists of epidemiologists and data analysts but its structure, and whether experts will be paid by the government, have not yet been announced.The JBC is headed by Dr Clare Gardiner, a qualified epidemiologist, medical researcher, and cybersecurity director at GCHQ.She reports to Baroness Dido Harding, the chief of NHS Test and Trace and the entire JBC organisation falls under the control of the Department of Health, which answers to the Health Secretary, Matt Hancock. It is currently unclear exactly how the JBC will operate with other bodies like Public Health England.She reports to Baroness Dido Harding, the chief of NHS Test and Trace and the entire JBC organisation falls under the control of the Department of Health, which answers to the Health Secretary, Matt Hancock.Scientists fear that allowing scientists on the Government payroll to advise on Covid-19 will compromise its independence.Dr Richard Horton, editor of the medical journal The Lancet, said on Twitter: 'The replacement of SAGE by the Joint Biosecurity Centre as the principal mechanism for advising government on the intersection of Covid-19 science with policy is a setback for indpendent scientific advice to government, a setback for transparency, and a setback for public trust.' Professor Susan Michie, a health psychologist at University College London, said: 'With deaths in England over 100 a day and no clear strategy as to how to reduce this to zero Covid, it would be very strange and worrying to reduce the role, cohesiveness and frequency of SAGE and to transfer responsibilities to a new body, the Joint Biosecurity Centre, that is shrouded in secrecy, with no information about its members, how they were selected, and methods for governance, oversight and accountability. 'Transparency of science and the relationship between science and policy is going to be key to public trust, which the Government needs to rebuild urgently.' SAGE will now take more of a back seat role, meeting less frequently, and with its many sub-groups reporting directly to the relevant ministers. Insiders have pointed out that SAGE is designed to respond to emergencies but it is not necessarily set up to work for a lengthy period of time under massive pressure. Some believe it is just not sustainable to expect SAGE members to continue working in the way that they have been. A spokesman for the group told the BBC: 'SAGE will continue to provide a single consensus view of scientific advice at the heart of government decision-making, to inform the national strategic response to the coronavirus epidemic.'As we move into the next phase of the coronavirus response, the JBC will complement the work of Sage, providing more operational focus including data analysis and epidemiological expertise, with the aim of ensuring that outbreaks of coronavirus are detected and brought under control quickly.'It remains unclear exactly how the JBC will operate and how it will fit in and work with other government bodies like Public Health England.Former government chief scientific adviser Sir David King said: 'Are the JBC scientists going to be willing to be cross-examined by the media, or is it a body feeding information behind the scenes to ministers?'If it is the latter, then how will government regain the trust of the public?' Professor Robert Dingwall, a sociologist at Nottingham Trent University, said: 'I think that experience has shown that the present structures are not ideal, although I am not sure that the JBC is the right way to go...'There is relatively little in the public domain about the staffing and working of the JBC. 'I would certainly agree that more information would be desirable as it is put together and that there should be a commitment to transparency in its advice and reports.'Personally, I would prefer to see a more interdisciplinary body created as the top tier, linking the chief scientists of major government departments with a range of high-level outside expertise in the sciences and social sciences, and supported by a permanent director and secretariat.' Despite criticisms of the way the JBC appears to be eclipsing SAGE and becoming the go-to advisory body for officials, experts did not all speak fondly of SAGE. Professor Dingwall said: 'SAGE has normally been a group convened for specific emergencies with a fluid membership, reflecting the nature of the event. 'The danger of such a system is that too narrow a range of expertise may become involved, with a limited degree of intellectual challenge and critical scrutiny. 'In the case of the present pandemic, for example, there has clearly been a slippage from the societal approach envisaged in the 2007 plan to a narrower biomedical/public health approach.'And Professor Derek Hill, a medicine expert at University College London, added: 'It is important that the JBC learns lessons from the Covid-19 response to date. 'One issue that was underestimated is the importance of medical equipment, like PPE, ventilators, and testing kits in managing a pandemic. 'It is essential that JBC has access to expertise on these sorts of technologies: the way they are developed and regulated, and their performance. SAGE seemed to have limited expertise in these areas.' ",Web Publication

The only good option available to most retail investors once a sell-off has hit is to ride it out. Stock markets always recover, the only question is how long it will take. In the case of this latest crash, not long at all. Failing to realise this and selling straight after the slump is very costly. Even if you think that over time the market will slip back again, it always seemed very likely there would be some degree of bounce in the near term.Analysis from Quilter has put some numbers on this. They reveal that those who divested at the bottom of the market in March may have lost ten times more than those who waited it out for just two months.If you then decided the stock market wasn't for you after that, you would still have been able to get much more of your money back than if you had sold in the middle of the panic. Taking some key Investment Association sectors as benchmarks, running the numbers revealed that depending on the asset class, investments recovered anywhere between 9 per cent and 19 per cent by the end of May.For example, someone who had £100k invested at the beginning of the year and was invested in an average fund in the IA Global sector would have since seen their investment drop as low as £78,645. However, since then it has recovered to £98,159 at the end of May, meaning losses only a tenth the size in percentage terms.The numbers also offer a useful reminder that if you are likely to need to cash out in the near future you must taper down your equities position in favour of cash and bonds. The plunges for the mixed IA categories were less severe than the equities-only ones in most cases. Mark Pittaccio, behavioral economist at Quilter Financial Planning commented: 'Successful investors know that investing is a long-term commitment. Rationally we know that if we are able to ride out the periods of decline in the market investments will recover. And it should be easier to spot as we have been here before with 2008 being one of the most recent examples in history.''However, rationality does not always prevail and when you start seeing your investment value dropping by hundreds and then thousands of pounds it can be hard to sit there and deal with the sinking feeling in your stomach.' 'We feel the pain of losing what we already have more than we feel pleasure in gains. If acted upon, this natural aversion to loss causes the greatest detriment to investors.''It is therefore important to remember the purpose behind their investing in the first place and to look at the whole picture rather than just last night's negative headlines,' he continued.'Learning to cope with these emotions remains a vital lesson. When we see our portfolio value plummet along with our expectations we need to be able to resist the natural temptation to run and sell when prices are low.' ",Web Publication
170,Why England may pose a threat to Scotland's plans,"July 8, 2020",International,i - Independent Print Ltd,1061,1061,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,,Why England may pose a threat to Scotland's plans,"With new coronavirus infections falling fast, Scotland now seems to have a real chance to effectively eliminate Covid-19 transmission among the general public. But some experts warn that one big obstacle stands in its way: England.Despite much higher levels of infection and hospitalisation, the UK Government has since May been easing England's lockdown restrictions more rapidly than the devolved governments in Edinburgh, Cardiff and Stormont.The end of an earlier lockdown lockstep has led to increasingly clear policy differences that are piling new strains on already fraying UK unity and has sparked fierce disputes over the possibility of introducing controls on visitors from England to Scotland.Devi Sridhar, professor of global public health at the University of Edinburgh, said Scotland had turned towards a ""zero-Covid strategy"" in recent weeks, but this was made more difficult by the UK Government's readiness to allow the virus to continue to ""run through"" the English population.""I don't think we'll ever get to effective elimination if we have an open land border with a place that doesn't have a similar policy,"" said Professor Sridhar, who is a member of a group advising the Scottish Government on Covid-19.Mark Drakeford, First Minister of Wales, had suggested that fully curbing coronavirus in the country could be impossible if England took a different approach. In normal times, more than 130,000 people cross the border daily for work, and Wales has been seeing similar numbers of new cases as England, despite its more cautious lockdown easing.""Whilst we are working to eliminate the virus, the nature of our porous border with England means we are reliant on our neighbours doing the same,"" Mr Drakeford said.Northern Ireland has also been more cautious about easing coronavirus restrictions than England, despite far lower numbers of deaths and only 26 positive tests for Covid-19 in the seven days to 2 July. Leaders in the region are increasingly concerned about a threatened second wave.A number of experts and many business leaders across the UK are supportive of Prime Minister Boris Johnson's more rapid lockdown easing, and say that quickly rebuilding the economy is vital to reducing the huge social and health damage inflicted by the crisis.There are also worries about the cost of trying to achieve effective elimination - which means ending general transmission of Covid-19 and using testing and tracing systems to quickly spot individual case, coupled with action to limit imports of the virus from abroad.Opposition Scottish Conservatives have repeatedly accused Nicola Sturgeon, the First Minister, of moving too slowly to ease restrictions on the hospitality and retail sectors, saying the proindependence Scottish National party leader is trying to drive a wedge between Edinburgh and London.But other experts would prefer England to adopt the more cautious approach of the devolved nations, and applaud Ms Sturgeon for trying to ""come as close as it is possible to get to eliminating this virus in Scotland"".Susan Michie, professor of health psychology at University College London, condemned Mr Johnson's decision to reopen indoor pubs in England as a ""disaster waiting to happen"" that was ""exactly what we should not be doing"".Scotland should ""keep on going in that careful, cautious way, because it is obviously showing massive dividends compared to south of the border"", Professor Michie told the BBC's Good Morning Scotland last week.While coronavirus-related death rates in Scotland remain only slightly below those of England, other important measures of the pandemic have diverged.Scottish government modelling suggests the number of infectious people has fallen by more than a quarter each week since mid-May.But in England, a pilot survey for the Office for National Statistics suggests progress in reducing the number of infected people has stalled. ""Incidence appears to have decreased between mid-May and early June 2020, but it has also since levelled off,"" the survey found.In a signal of the growing tensions over coronavirus policy, all three devolved governments on Friday declined to immediately endorse UK plans for ""air bridges"" that would exempt travellers to England from scores of countries from quarantine requirements.Ms Sturgeon said she wanted a UK-wide approach to quarantine for ""obvious practical reasons"", but suggested Scotland's much lower Covid-19 prevalence meant that visitors from countries with levels of the virus that were acceptable to England may not be able to travel north of the border without quarantine.Some experts say quarantine on visitors from England may be needed to prevent continual new outbreaks in Scotland, a prospect that Ms Sturgeon has refused to rule out - to the outrage of some opponents of Scottish independence.Mr Johnson last Wednesday even went as far as to deny the existence of the 96-mile dividing line between the two ancient nations, beyond which the UK Prime Minister's writ on matters such as health, education and transport does not run. ""There is no such thing as a border between England and Scotland,"" he told the House of Commons.A spokesperson for the UK Government said it continued to engage closely with the devolved administrations. ""From the very start we have been tackling the pandemic as one United Kingdom, following the best scientific and advice and the guidance of the four chief medical officers,"" the spokesperson said.Professor Sridhar, who was accused by Scottish Conservative politicians of being politically partisan after she posted a tweet criticising Mr Johnson's handling of the pandemic, told the Financial Times that effectively eliminating coronavirus would require extending lockdown measures in the short term and indefinite controls on visitors from abroad.But she said success would allow a far greater easing of domestic restrictions and a return to normal life for vulnerable groups currently enduring shielding policies.""If you open too early and the virus is still circulating, then you just have to shut down again,"" Professor Sridhar said. ""It's always going to be a lurking threat.""ARTICLE REPUBLISHED FROM THE FINANCIAL TIMES.

Boris announces full-steam ahead for next stage of un-lockdown with street markets and car showrooms open next week and other retailers two weeks later - but hair salons stay SHUT,"May 25, 2020 Monday",International,MailOnline,3319,3319,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,"James RobinsonDavid Wilcock, Whitehall Correspondent For Mailonline",ALL shops open from June 15th! Boris announces full-steam ahead for next stage of un-lockdown with street markets and car showrooms open next week and other retailers two weeks later - but hair salons stay SHUT,"•Outdoor markets and car showrooms will now be able to reopen from June 1•Independent shops and department stores will be able to reopen from June 15•But government warns shops will have to adhere to social distancing guidance•Boris Johnson says government will have powers to enforce the new guidelines                     Boris Johnson has paved the way for the 'sale of the century' as he gave the go-ahead for high street businesses to reopen - with retailers expected to slash prices in order to clear their stock which has been mothballed since the coronavirus lockdown began.The Prime Minister gave all retail stores the green light to lift the shutters on June 15, as he attempted to bring the coronavirus-battered UK High Street back to life.Speaking at the daily Covid-19 briefing at Downing Street this evening he also gave the go-ahead for non-essential shops, including department stores and independent businesses, to reopen from June 15.Outdoor markets and car showrooms will be allowed to reopen from June 1 as long as they adhere to strict social distancing guidelines. The move will provide a welcome boost for businesses forced to close in March at a huge financial cost to themselves and to the Treasury, which has spent hundreds of billions of pounds keeping them afloat and their staff paid. But last night's announcement came as Mr Johnson faces massive political pressure to sack his chief aide Dominic Cummings. The timing is likely to fuel suspicion among politician opponents that he has pulled this positive news out of his hat to deflect attention from the huge political fallout.The reopening is likely to spark a sales frenzy as shops try to emerge from the pandemic-induced wreckage of the economy, while consumers will be glad to leave the house. [item name=video id=4368230 style=2 /]Analysts believe there could be as much as £15billion-worth of stock which needs to be sold, meaning there will be 'wall-to-wall' sales until January. Which shops are opening - and which others will stay shut?  Still open •Supermarkets•Pharmacies•Garden centres•Takeaway/delivery food outletsJune 1•Outdoor markets•Car showroomsJune 15•Indoor markets•Clothing and shoe shops•Toy stores•Bookshops•Furniture shops•Electronics stores•Photography studios•Tailors•Auction housesStaying shut for now•Restaurants, bars and pubs•Cafes and canteens•Holiday accommodation - hotels, hostels, B&Bs, holiday rentals, campsites and boarding houses•Hairdressers, barbers, beauty and nail salons•Playgrounds, outdoor gyms and outdoor swimming pools•Piercing and tattoo parlours•Caravan parks (commercial)•Libraries•Community centres•Places of worship•Museums and galleries•Nightclubs•Cinemas, theatres and concert halls•Bingo halls, casinos and betting shops•Spas and massage parlours•Skating rinks•Indoor fitness studios, gyms, swimming pools or other indoor leisure centres•Indoor arcades, bowling alleys, soft play centres and similar facilities•FunfairsBut because of movement restrictions it is unlikely to be an immediate free-for-all - and hospitality businesses like pubs and restaurants will remain closed. All shops wanting to reopen will have to follow new guidance, set to be released today, with Mr Johnson warning that the government will have powers to enforce the new rules if necessary.And the director general of the British Chambers of Commerce, Adam Marshall, said: 'Businesses will be taking a safe, proportionate and risk-based approach to returning to work, in close consultation with their staff. 'For many this will be an entirely new way of operating as they apply guidance to the practical realities of their business.' Shoppers will have to 'exercise restraint' by not trying on clothing and testing goods when stores reopen next month, Michael Gove has said.Speaking about plans to reopen non-essential shops in June, the Minister for the Cabinet Office said shopping habits will have to change.He told BBC Breakfast today: 'It's also the case that we need to ensure that some of the shopping habits people may have grown used to in the pre-Covid days are habits that we exercise a degree of restraint on.'So when it comes to touching and testing goods, when it comes to trying on clothing, when it comes to trying make-up and so on, that all of us exercise restraint in not doing that and recognising that as these stores reopen, it is a new normal, but it will allow us to ensure there are a wider range of goods and will also ensure the economy can return to a new normal, that is absolutely vital for people's jobs.'Spot checks will be carried out on stores and local authorities will work with the Government to ensure complaints from the public are followed up on.Safety measures include storing returned items for 72 hours before putting them back on the shop floor, placing protective coverings on large items touched by the public such as beds or sofas and frequent cleaning of objects and surfaces that are touched regularly.Speaking at the conference last night, Mr Johnson said: 'Today I want to put the retail sector on notice of our intention to reopen shops so they can get ready to reopen. 'So I can announce that it is our intention to allow outdoor markets to reopen on June 1, subject to premises being Covid secure, as well as car showrooms which often have sufficient out door space.'From June 15 we intend to allow all other non-essential retail, ranging from department stores to small independent shops to reopen.'We will set out our formal assessment of the five tests that we set for adjusting the lockdown later this week as part of the three-weekly review we are legally required to undertake by Thursday.'But because of the progress we are making I can, with confidence, put the British people on notice of the changes we intend to introduce as we move to step two. 'We know that the transmission of the virus is lower outdoors and that it is easier to follow Covid secure guidelines in open spaces.' Mr Johnson added that the government will today publish social distancing guidelines to help shops become 'Covid secure' before reopening.He said: 'This will ensure there can be no doubt about what steps should be taken.'We will of course have powers to enforce these conditions, where it is required.'Mr Johnson also put emphasis on consumers to keep safe themselves, by repeating his new 'wash your hands, keep your distance' slogan.He added: 'We will only be successful if we all remember the basics - so wash your hands, keep social distance, and isolate if you have symptoms - and get a test.' [item name=video id=4369864 style=2 /][related][item name=video id=4368298 style=2 /]The boost to retail comes as official data, released earlier this week, showed how retail sales plummeted by nearly a fifth last month as Britons stopped buying fuel and clothing amid lockdown.The record plunge of 18.1 per cent month-on-month underlines the massive hit to the economy from coronavirus chaos. Full lockdown was imposed by the government on March 23, with non-essential shops ordered to shut.Pubs may stay shut until July warns brewery bossPunters hoping to sink a pint in a pub from next month have had their hopes dashed as it was claimed bars and beer gardens could be closed until July.Ralph Findlay, chief executive of brewing giant Marston's, which owns 1,400 premises, said any move to reopen establishments was at least five weeks off.It will come as a fresh blow to drinkers who were told by the government watering holes could be open from June 1.Premises have been allowed to operate takeaway services during the lockdown to try to keep businesses afloat.Staff have been wearing personal protective equipment and ensuring customers are two metres apart in queues. Mr Findlay told Radio 4's Today programme: 'We are desperate to know when we are going to be able to reopen our pubs as well.'We have had an indication from the government that the target date for some sort of reopening is early July.'It's not clear at this point under what circumstances we'd be allowed to open, in terms of social distancing or what other restrictions might be in place.'So I think there's a lot of work still to do to understand that at the moment and the economic consequences of whatever restrictions are still in place.'But early July would look at this point to be the soonest that we'll see pubs opening in this country.'In the first full month after the draconian curbs were introduced, clothing sales volumes were hit by a 50.2 per cent drop - having already seen a fall of 34.9 per cent in March.Meanwhile, fuel saw a 52 per cent reduction, and food sales were down as the stockpiling frenzy eased, according to official figures.One of the few areas to see an increase was off-licence sales, which were up 2.3 per cent on the month.This could be due to the inability of Britons to go to pubs and bars - which are still set to remain shut beyond the date given by the government for the reopening of retail stores.Punters had been given hope of a return to pubs and bars on June 1, after the government suggested the data for the reopening of watering holes across Britain.But earlier this week, Ralph Findlay, chief executive of brewing giant Marston's, which owns 1,400 premises, said any move to reopen establishments was at least five weeks off.Meanwhile, almost all store types saw record online spending in April, the ONS said, as many retailers shifted to online-only trading.The only sectors to see an increase in volume of sales last month were non-store retailing such as online and catalogue businesses, up 18 per cent on the previous month, and off licences.Meanwhile, an industry insider has claimed warehouse storage space for high street retailers is more than 90 per cent full, meaning shops have reportedly been storing summer fashion in railway sidings and on former Ministry of Defence land - and it could spark a mass of sales. M&S's price cuts will be as much as 50 per cent in what the outlet is billing as a 'rainbow sale'. Ten per cent of the store's takings will go to NHS charities.Already, the firm is advertising online price cuts of up to 30 per cent on items including men's shirts and women's footwear and linen.However, some shirts are being sold on the firm's website with price reductions of nearly 50 per cent.Topshop, Miss Selfridge and French Connection are also advertising discounts of up to 50 per cent, though some items of clothing are listed with even bigger reductions.Some women's vests being sold on the Miss Selfridge website are advertised at just £3, down from the normal price of £10. Retail analyst Richard Hyman believes there will be 'wall-to-wall promotions for the rest of the year.'He estimates that between £10billion and £15billion worth of spring and summer clothes are sitting in shops and warehouses.Earlier today, official government figures showed there had been 121 more deaths related to coronavirus across all settings, taking the official death toll to almost 37,000. It marks the lowest Monday death toll since the UK's draconian lockdown was enforced on March 23 (74 deaths).For comparison, 160 fatalities were announced last Monday and 118 were recorded yesterday.But officials warn that death numbers released on Sundays and Mondays are usually significantly smaller due to a delay in processing fatalities over the weekend.Department of Health chiefs also announced 1,625 more Covid-19 cases today, the first time the UK has recorded fewer than 2,000 positive tests in the space of 24 hours in almost nine weeks. Separate figures showed 8,800 Brits are currently in hospital being treated for coronavirus - down 12 per cent in a week. The Prime Minister's announcement in the Downing Street press conference last night came after his aide Dominic Cummings refused to apologise for driving 260 miles to Durham during the coronavirus lockdown.Vote Leave maverick Mr Cummings - who is facing calls to be sacked - faced accusations of 'double standards' but he told a press conference in the Number 10 Rose Garden: 'I don't regret what I did.'In other developments to Britain's coronavirus crisis today:•Britons descended on parks and beaches amid an expected 79F heatwave as they declared, 'If Dominic Cummings can break the rules, we can too';•An NHS hospital in the Somerset seaside hotspot of Weston-super-Mare was forced to stop taking new patients due to a high number of coronavirus cases;•Newsreader Simon McCoy slammed his BBC colleague Gary Lineker for abusing his position after the Match of the Day host accused the Prime Minister of lying;•Schools face a long journey before they are able to return to normal, Education Secretary Gavin Williamson said as he insisted classes must restart on June 1.The Department of Health's daily death toll means the rolling seven-day average of victims has dropped to just 303 - the lowest since March 31 (274) and less than a third of the peak on April 14 (943).It takes the overall official number of victims to 36,914 - but the true number is thousands higher because it only takes into account laboratory-confirmed cases, not the suspected deaths in other settings.Of the 121 new deaths, 76 occurred in hospitals - most of which were in England. The remainder of the newly recorded Covid-19 fatalities happened in other settings, such as care homes.England recorded 104 deaths, followed by nine in Scotland, seven in Wales and one in Northern Ireland - tallies that do not match up with the individual counts recorded by each of the home nations.For instance, Scotland's own health chiefs today announced three new deaths but yesterday recorded seven. Northern Ireland had the same issue, recording eight new fatalities today but only one yesterday.The issue is only thought to occur with Scotland and Northern Ireland because of a difference in how the data is collected. Wales announced seven new deaths today and yesterday.NHS England figures also do not match the individual tally collated by the Department of Health for England (104) because the official toll includes deaths across all settings, not just in hospitals.                     CUMMINGS REFUSES TO APOLOGISE FOR DRIVING TO DURHAM DURING CORONAVIRUS LOCKDOWN                     Dominic Cummings today refused to apologise for driving 260 miles to Durham during the coronavirus lockdown as he claimed he had always behaved 'reasonably and legally' amid growing calls for the PM's top aide to be sacked.Mr Cummings said his decision to travel to the city to stay in a cottage on his parents' land was the result of a 'very complicated, tricky situation' as he admitted he had not sought Boris Johnson's permission to make the journey at the end of March.The Vote Leave maverick has faced accusations of 'double standards', with the nation having been told to stay at home, but he told an unprecedented press conference in the Number 10 Rose Garden: 'I don't regret what I did... I think what I did was reasonable in the circumstances.'Asked directly if he had offered to quit or had even considered it, he added: 'No I have not offered to resign, no I have not considered it.' Mr Cummings conceded that 'reasonable people may well disagree' with his chosen course of action but he was resolute in his belief that he had acted in an appropriate manner and had not broken the rules.He insisted 'I don't think there is one rule for me and one rule for other people' and blamed public anger at media reports 'that have not been true'.The usually scruffy adviser was wearing an open collared shirt as he confirmed that he had travelled to the town of Barnard Castle on April 12 after the end of his period in self-isolation with coronavirus.He insisted he and his family had not walked around the town 30 miles from Durham and had only ventured 15 metres from the car to the river bank. He said the purpose of the journey was to see if he was fit enough to make the drive back to London.He also said that he and his family had walked around a woods during their stay in Durham but that they were within his parents' private property and that they had not come into contact with anyone else.Meanwhile, he claimed he did not stop for fuel on the way up to Durham but he had stopped once on the way back.He said: 'Yesterday I gave a full account to the Prime Minister of my actions between March 27 and April 14, what I thought and did.And the two use different measures for hospital deaths, with the DH relying on data from Public Health England, which uses several sources to provide an update every afternoon.The figures published today by NHS England confirm that April 8 was still the peak of the crisis, with 891 hospital deaths recorded - up from the 59 that were announced today by NHS England.Of the 59 new deaths recorded in England's hospitals, 47 occurred over the weekend. Five took place on Friday, while the remaining seven victims succumbed to the disease between May 16 and 21.It comes as Dominic Cummings this afternoon made a public statement to directly address claims he broke lockdown rules by travelling to Durham, Downing Street confirmed. The Prime Minister's chief adviser today refused to apologise for driving 260 miles to Durham during the coronavirus lockdown as he claimed he had always behaved 'reasonably and legally' amid growing calls for the PM's top aide to be sacked. Mr Cummings said his decision to travel to the city to stay in a cottage on his parents' land was the result of a 'very complicated, tricky situation' as he admitted he had not sought Boris Johnson's permission to make the journey at the end of March.The Vote Leave maverick has faced accusations of 'double standards', with the nation having been instructed to stay at home, but he told an unprecedented press conference in the Number 10 Rose Garden: 'I don't regret what I did... I think what I did was reasonable in the circumstances.'Asked directly if he had offered to quit or had even considered it, he added: 'No I have not offered to resign, no I have not considered it.' The intervention came after one of the government's scientific advisers warned the 'debacle' over the lockdown journey had 'fatally undermined' the nation's fight against coronavirus.Professor Stephen Reicher, who is a member of the Government's advisory group on behavioural science which feeds into SAGE, said the result of 'undermining adherence to the rules' will be that 'more people are going to die'.Mr Johnson is facing a furious backlash from ministers, Tory MPs and even bishops after he yesterday attempted to mount an extraordinary defence of Mr Cummings, staking his reputation on trying to protect his aide.At a dramatic Downing Street press conference last night, the PM claimed Mr Cummings had acted 'responsibly, legally and with integrity' while making a controversial 260-mile trip from London to Durham during lockdown.Mr Johnson insisted Mr Cummings had 'followed the instincts of every father' by driving to his parents' farm after his wife developed symptoms of coronavirus. The PM's defence of his aide prompted fury among Britons. Today, Boris Johnson admitted his top aide Dominic Cummings had created 'confusion, anger and pain' last night as he again defended him from fury over his breach of lockdown rules.The Prime Minister said Mr Cummings had acted 'legally' at last night's Downing Street news conference as senior ministers rallied around the beleaguered strategist, but added repeatedly: 'You will have to make up your own minds.'Meanwhile, sun-worshippers descended on parks and beaches today for the Bank Holiday amid an expected 79F heatwave, which could see parts of the country basked in temperatures hotter than Athens, Nice and Barcelona.Crowds formed outside the Serpentine in London's Hyde Park, as beaches in Sussex, Essex and Dorset quickly filled up with visitors looking to enjoy the dry and sunny conditions forecast to last the whole day.",Web Publication
172,"No 10 must promote face mask use more forcefully, experts warn;Criticism comes as government launches public information campaign amid low takeup Coronavirus - latest updatesSee all our coronavirus coverage","July 7, 2020 Tuesday",International,The Guardian (London),720,720,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,Haroon Siddique and Heather Stewart,"No 10 must promote face mask use more forcefully, experts warnCriticism comes as government launches public information campaign amid low takeup Coronavirus - latest updatesSee all our coronavirus coverage","Experts have urged the government to go beyond a newly announced campaign telling people in England how to wear face coverings and promote their use more forcefully, amid low takeup by the public.The information campaign will instruct people to ensure that both nose and mouth are covered in order to ensure they effective. But scientists say the government should be doing more to increase use of face coverings, which are currently mandatory only on public transport.After the president of the Royal Society, Venki Ramakrishnan, said on Monday that refusing to wear a mask in indoor public settings should become as socially unacceptable as drink-driving or not wearing a seatbelt, other experts said the government should play its part.Prof Susan Michie, a psychologist on a subgroup of Sage and also member of Independent Sage, said on Tuesday: ""It's becoming increasingly clear that face masks are needed and warranted, particularly in indoor spaces. And I think we really need to begin thinking about how we achieve that given there's no cultural history and there's no huge appetite from looking around at the British public at the moment.""We need to have a really effective and nuanced campaign, and to explain why face masks are important, how they should be worn. And I think we need to do it sooner rather than later.""Ramakrishnan made his comments after two studies were published jointly by the Royal Society and British Academy stating that face coverings could help limit the spread of Covid-19. One suggested that in late April uptake of mask-wearing in the UK was around 25%, compared with 83.4% in Italy, 65.8% in the United States and 63.8% in Spain.In Scotland, face coverings will be mandatory in shops from 10 July, whereas in England people are advised to wear them where possible in ""enclosed public spaces where social distancing isn't possible and where you will come into contact with people you do not normally meet"".Unlike Boris Johnson, the Scottish first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, has appeared in public wearing a mask. Neither the prime minister nor the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, wore masks when they visited retailers to mark their reopening.Speaking at the same meeting hosted by the BMJ, Philippa Whitford, SNP health spokesperson in Westminster and a breast surgeon, said role models could boost takeup. ""If you start to get celebrities and others acting as role models [, it could help],"" she said. ""And so I think making it mandatory is important, but I think also it's promoting it at every opportunity.""Ruth Hussey, former chief medical officer for Wales, said: ""I think the suggestion that this [wearing face masks] goes along with the wider campaign to eliminate the virus is very sensible, not least because as we go towards winter we will spend more time in enclosed spaces.""However, there remain sceptics as to the benefits of face coverings. Dr Antonio Lazzarino, of the Department of Epidemiology and Public Health at University College London, said the comparison with drink-driving and not wearing a seatbelt was not a valid one.""We know that drink-driving is a very dangerous thing to do and we know the reasons for that, and the same with seatbelts. We know the mitigation of harm when you have a collision and we know the reasons why that protects you from from concussion,"" he said. ""So that's all clear, all the mechanics and the risk are outlined very clearly, there's no need for further research. We know everything we should know. But this is just not the case at all for face masks.""Dr Simon Clarke, associate professor in cellular microbiology at the University of Reading, said the evidence remained mixed but, even if it was not, ""mass behavioural change, such as reduction in rates of drink-driving or smoking, do not come about overnight, but from a complex package of incentives, laws, taxes, messages, stories and beliefs."" Giving details of the information campaign on how to wear masks, Johnson's official spokesman said: ""A face covering should cover both the nose and mouth to reduce the spread of coronavirus droplets, helping to protect others ... It is a message we will be keen to emphasise in coming days."" Johnson has been criticised for delaying the the advice to wear face coverings, when they were already mandatory in several other countries. ",Newspaper
173,We'll say thanks with just our eyes,"June 8, 2020 Monday",International,The Times (London),407,407,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,Janice Turner,We'll say thanks with just our eyes,"They insist that you wear a mask now at my local garden centre. So thanking a couple for saving my place in the queue while I moved my car seemed somehow insufficient. ""You can't see my face,"" I said. ""But believe me, I'm smiling at you.""Without really trying, I've acquired numerous masks. Basic black, medical grade, a sprigged floral thing bought on the craft website Etsy, a Cath Kidston polka-dot one given by a kind neighbour, a mask that turns my lower face into a tiger's growl. And I hate them all.A mask muffles your speech, inhibits communication so you don't attempt a joke with a supermarket cashier for fear of it being misconstrued. Your glasses steam up unless you squeeze the wire thingy on to the bridge of your nose. I recall a Muslim friend, who during a brief religious phase wore a niqab, saying she hated smelling her own stale breath. I feel I'm sucking in the carbon dioxide I've just exhaled. It's hard to breathe - although a lot harder when you have Covid-19. And wearing one on a bus is a homeopathic dose of what NHS staff and carers have endured for months.At the peak of the pandemic, I'd see many exercising in my local park in masks, especially, for understandable reasons, ethnic minority families, and wonder if I should too. But the warm breeze on my face during my daily cycle, the one hour a day I felt normal, outweighed the fear that outdoors I might inhale a stray viral particle.Now, however, masks are the price of life returning to something like normal. The lockdown genie has truly left the bottle. Instead we are fed a mixture of ""real"" and behavioural science. Do masks stop transmission? Medics cannot agree and a consultant friend fears they breed complacency, so we stop doing the one thing that matters in fighting coronavirus: constantly washing our hands. But masks certainly make us feel safer.Frightened folk might be emboldened by a cloth barrier to venture out of their homes at last, go shopping again or return to work.Wearing one close to others, especially indoors, seems, until this damn virus is dead, an act of courtesy. Just good manners, like not wiping your nose on your sleeve.Among all the strange ironies of this year is a prime minister who compared women in burqas to letter boxes or bank robbers now ordering us to cover our faces. But there is a real human desire from earliest infancy to see and read faces. So we'll just have to learn to say thank you with our eyes.",Newspaper

Pictures showed sunseekers arriving at tourist hotspots across the UK to soak up the 26C heat, despite strict measures still being in force.But there was little sign of people sticking to social distancing rules at heaving beaches in Brighton, Bournemouth and Essex.Temperatures were already pushing 20C by 10am this morning as forecasters predicted London would be hotter than Barcelona or Athens by the afternoon. Some fear that the warm weather could cause the lockdown to collapse following revelations about Dominic Cummings' 260-mile roadtrip during the lockdown. Last night Boris Johnson defended his aide over a trip that he had made with his wife and son to visit his parents to Durham. Many expressed outrage at the revelations which led to accusations of double standards and calls for Cummings' resignation.Russell Martin tweeted: ""So are you telling us that the lockdown is now officially over and we can do whatever we like whenever we like Because if Dominic Cummings can break the rules with impunity, the rest of us can too."" Community Safety officers patrolled the beach in Southend-on-Sea, Essex, to try and enforce social distancing measures.Elsewhere, cars were parked bumper to bumper on a packed Camber Sands on the Kent coast and Bournemouth beach in Dorset.Pictures from Kent showed Botany Bay and Margate Main Sands rammed with beach goers.Residents complained of a 'strong smell of urine' due to a lack of facilities at those locations, Kent Live reported.The beach at Weston-super-Mare in north Somerset was also packed with revellers.Officers in Hillingdon, northwest London, begged the public to use 'common sense' after pictures emerged of large groups at Ruislip Lido.Other pictures showed families enjoying a picnic on benches in Cannizzaro Park Wimbledon Village in South West London. Liverpool councillor Nina Killen wrote on Twitter : ""Reports of cars parked illegally at Formby coast today. Many people say they're happy to pay £35 fine. ""Apparently this can't be increased as a deterrent as it is in legislation. Formby car parks are full. Please do not travel to the Formby coast today."" The Met Office said temperatures should reach as high as 26C in London, with 21C expected in Newcastle, 20C in Edinburgh and Belfast and 22C in Southampton.It comes as Durham's acting police and crime commissioner, Steve White, said there was a ""plethora"" of additional information which deserved ""appropriate examination"".He said he has written to Durham police's chief constable asking her to ""establish the facts concerning any potential breach of the law or regulations in this matter"".Meanwhile, the Prime Minister is chairing a Cabinet meeting where ministers are expected to discuss the easing of restrictions for certain sectors of the economy, including the reopening of some non-essential shops.It follows confirmation that the phased reopening of England's primary schools will commence on June 1.Mr Cummings' actions have sparked fury among some MPs, and led to warnings that he has ""undermined"" efforts to fight coronavirus.Professor Stephen Reicher, a member of the Government's advisory group on behavioural science, told ITV's Good Morning Britain: ""If you look at the research it shows the reason why people observed lockdown was not for themselves, it wasn't because they were personally at risk, they did it for the community, they did it because of a sense of 'we're all in this together'.""If you give the impression there's one rule for them and one rule for us you fatally undermine that sense of 'we're all in this together' and you undermine adherence to the forms of behaviour which have got us through this crisis.""Gloucestershire's independent police and crime commissioner Martin Surl said Mr Cummings' actions made a ""mockery"" of police enforcement earlier in the lockdown.He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""I think it makes it much harder for the police going forward -this will be quoted back at them time and time again when they try to enforce the new rules.""But I think more importantly it makes something of a mockery of the police action going back when the message was very, very clear: stay at home.""",Newspaper; Web Publication
176,I'm not buying into new world of shopping,"June 7, 2020 Sunday",International,The Sunday Times (London),722,722,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,Brenda Power,I'm not buying into new world of shopping,"By the time our local Aldi opened last Thursday morning, there were more than 200 people queuing along the pavement and down into the car park. The store was running a special offer on garden furniture and accessories. A wicker swing chair, a (EURO)60 parasol and solar lights were the main attractions, and every now and then a staff member would update the crowds on stock levels. All 10 swing chairs were gone in the first few minutes, so several would-be customers left after that announcement. A few minutes later, the chap came out again to announce that the parasols were gone, and more disappointed shoppers drifted out of the queue. My neighbour hung on to the bitter end in the hope of finding the solar lights she wanted, but they too had been snapped up by the time she got inside.Welcome to the much-altered, post-pandemic shopping experience: zero spontaneity, zero impulse buys, zero certainty of stock and supply, and a minus rating for pleasure. The middle aisle in the German discounter once served to enliven the drudgery of the weekly shop with all of the aforementioned gratifications of retail therapy at bargain prices: you went in for basic groceries and came out with a karaoke machine, a toilet seat that lit up, and a harmonica (true story). During the weeks of lockdown, this continued to offer the closest approximation of the vanished retail experience, and so people queued and jostled for items designed to be tossed into trolleys as a spur-of-the-moment treat.Nobody really needs a one-person swing chair, a solar light or a giant parasol. Apart from groceries, firstworld shopping is almost never about need, and all about desire. It is less about requirements than aspirations; women in particular, I suspect, enjoy shopping for a life that is imagined rather than expected. Few nights out match the pleasure of getting ready (I'm sure this is a female thing) and few events pan out as you pictured them when you bought the holiday dress, the party shoes, the perfect lipstick. You shop for the life and, when it comes to garden furniture, for the summer you hope you'll have, rather than the more likely reality. Retailers spend fortunes on consultants and behavioural scientists to help them design stores to whet, anticipate and satisfy our aspirational outlays. The western world's retail marketplace is predicated on people being able to stroll into stores and malls, perhaps looking for one item, and being persuaded to leave with multiple products they didn't realise they wanted. For the foreseeable future, that entire model is redundant.Befpre deciding to reopen this week Penneys had cited concerns for the safety of customers and staff. It reasonably anticipated the sort of scenes that attended Ikea openings in the UK, where hundreds lined up for miles to buy flat-pack furniture and candle holders. But what happens when queues, limited numbers, one-way systems, ""don't handle the goods"", social-distance policing, and no fitting rooms become the norm? The notion of a shopping expedition as a family day out in a big centre or an outlet village - coffees and lunch included- as a leisure activity is a distant memory. The future will be shopping lists, joyless online purchases and reluctant forays into the queues only when necessary. Luxury stores such as Brown Thomas invited browsers to wander in, soak up the sumptuousness, try on shoes you'd need a second mortgage to afford, and maybe pick up an ""entry level"" designer product such as a hand cream as a treat. But ""standing in line"" and ""wandering in to browse"" are, sadly, mutually exclusive concepts.We've accepted that the way we socialise has changed, and pubs and restaurants will be unrecognisable. But it's only as the stores reopen that we'll discover just how much of our social lives, leisure activities, self-soothing mechanisms and internal narratives were bound up in shopping. It was always about imagining a better, happier, more accomplished version of yourself, a soft-focus fantasy where you entertained sparkling friends like a celebrity chef in a designer cardigan and a solar-lit garden, and you shopped to equip the life you hoped you'd have.Right now, though, most of us would happily settle for our old lives back. brenda.power@sunday-times.ieBuying things is almost never about need, and all about desire",Newspaper

179,"Norway's 'rock' caught in a storm;Person in the news | Nicolai Tangen ; The hedgie once described as a 'walking conflict of interest' is taking over the sovereign wealth fund, writes Richard Milne","May 30, 2020 Saturday",International,"Financial Times (London, England)",930,930,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,,"Norway's 'rock' caught in a stormPerson in the news | Nicolai Tangen ; The hedgie once described as a 'walking conflict of interest' is taking over the sovereign wealth fund, writes Richard Milne","N icolai Tangen says the past few weeks have been ""like being in the middle of a tumble-dryer"". One of London's most successful hedge fund managers, the 53-year-old seemed like the perfect person to run the world's largest sovereign wealth fund when he was announced as the next chief executive of Norway's $1tn oil fund in March. But since then, his appointment has unleashed the biggest storm around the fund in its 24-year history. Everything from an opulent private gathering to potential conflicts of interest and the placing of some of his funds in tax havens has faced intense scrutiny.Mr Tangen and Oystein Olsen, the governor of Norway's central bank, which houses the manager of the fund, signed a contract this week to regulate any potential conflicts of interest, only to face a hostile press conference and scepticism from opposition politicians.Underlying it all is a simple question: is Norway ready to allow a rich hedge fund manager to take over in September its national rainy day fund? The biggest petroleum-producing country in western Europe is facing the twin economic crises of Covid-19 and the drop in oil prices. Norway will take a record amount of money from the fund this year, forcing it to sell assets for the first time.A supporter of Mr Tangen says the furore around him is a classic case of Janteloven, the Scandinavian social code whose first rule states ""you're not to think you're anything special"". Another backer blames ""people with no experience talking about things they don't understand. They just go with the headlines. Norway is too small a country for such a large fund.""The controversy started with revelations about an all-expenses-paid seminar Mr Tangen organised last November in the US. He flew in friends, ministers and investors from Norway, the UK and elsewhere to attend a three-day event, with a concert by Sting and allday debates. They featured everyone from a former Olympic sailor and Norwegian military officer to hedge fund manager Paul Marshall, artist Olafur Eliasson, and included former FT columnist Lucy Kellaway and the FT's Gillian Tett, who moderated a panel.Piquantly, the current head of the oil fund, Yngve Slyngstad, also attended, accepting a flight home on a private jet with about 30 other Norwegians paid for by Mr Tangen - Mr Slyngstad later accepted he had ""really screwed up"".Mr Tangen knows that in his new job he will have to change his lifestyle. He has expressed regret that the seminar - which he spent several years planning - was quite so extravagant.But focus then moved to Mr Tangen's hedge fund AKO Capital, an $18bn fund that he started in 2005. Under his contract with the central bank, Mr Tangen will cut his ownership of AKO from 78 per cent to 43 per cent and donate all dividends during his five-year tenure - estimated at £1bn - to his charitable foundation. One leftwing opposition politician called Mr Tangen a ""walking conflict of interest"".It is a long way from Mr Tangen's beginnings in the southern coastal city of Kristiansand. He made money as a teenager collecting plastic bottles from football matches for the recycling deposits. As a 16-year-old, he started work at the local bank and dreamt of investing in the stock market.He then joined the elite course in Norway's military for his national service, learning Russian and interrogation techniques over 18 intense months. Stints at Cazenove and hedge fund Egerton Capital followed before he set up AKO, whose main fund has delivered returns three times better than the market since its launch in October 2005. Mr Tangen says AKO combines an investment philosophy focused on longterm holdings in quality companies such as LVMH and Ferrari, with a systematic approach. AKO has teams dedicated to forensic accounting, behavioural analysis, and market research, as well as more traditional equity research.Mr Tangen likes to challenge his fund managers; they must record reasons for every investment decision, to be reviewed later on. He brings in outsiders such as Arctic explorer Erling Kagge to talk to them. Mr Kagge describes Mr Tangen as ""curious, generous, hardworking, with a great sense of humour"".Norway's oil fund is one of the most important investors in the world, owning the equivalent of 1.4 per cent of every listed company, on average. But it is run closer to a passive index fund, with holdings in about 9,000 companies, than as an active investor. Some question if Mr Tangen is the right fit. He himself has given little away about how he wants to run the fund, apart from suggesting that ""fine-tuning"" its strict mandate could deliver excess returns.Money is not his motivation. His roughly NKr7m ($720,000) annual salary will be dwarfed by the up to NKr70m in wealth tax he estimates he will have to pay each year after moving his family - he is married with three children - to Oslo from London. Instead, he talks about running his life Soviet-style, with five-year plans, and that now is the time for public service.Mr Tangen insisted this week he has not thought for ""one second"" about backing out. But debate around his appointment is not yet over: the politicians who oversee Norway's central bank will give their opinion next month.For now, Mr Tangen says: ""This job is about standing like a rock when it's stormy around you, whether it be the media or volatility in capital markets. In the future, it's about trying to be a rock in the storm, on behalf of the Norwegian people.""richard.milne@ft.comThis furore is a classic case of 'Janteloven', the Scandinavian social code that forbids being 'special'",Newspaper
180,Insurance/Lemonade: pipping their rivals;Twitter: @FTLex,"June 10, 2020 Wednesday",International,"Financial Times (London, England)",394,394,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,,Insurance/Lemonade: pipping their rivalsTwitter: @FTLex,"Insurtech start-ups lure investors with promises of technology innovations that are able to oust traditional insurance groups. Lemonade, one of the biggest in the sector, is growing quickly. But so are net losses. Expansion is easier than profitability but the company is driving down its gross loss ratio.Making insurance more delightful is a noble, if unorthodox, goal. Sparky insurance tech start-up Lemonade's market listing document brims with such ambitions. A charity-linked business model promises to draw in young consumers while ""artificial intelligence, contemporary design and behavioral economics"" improves underwriting efficiency. Until it makes a profit on its underwriting, its claims look unconvincing.Lemonade's finances typify the fast-growing tech start-ups backed by SoftBank. In 2019, revenue increased three-fold year on year while losses more than doubled, leaving the company with $116m in premiums and $109m in net losses.Big data may well improve underwriting, helping insurance groups to make more accurate, costeffective insurance decisions. So-called ""insurtech"" companies raised just over $1bn last year, according to CB Insights.But insurance, a highly regulated, $5tn sector, is proving hard to disrupt. Many insurers used to make money investing pooled assets. Low fixedincome returns upended that. ""Net investment income"", Lemonade's interest from fixed maturity securities and other investments, accounted for just 5 per cent of 2019 revenues. The rest was from what it calls ""net earned premium"", premiums earned minus reinsurance costs.That means Lemonade must rely on its supposedly superior underwriting abilities. Unlike insurtech companies offering third-party products, Lemonade backs the policies it sells with its own balance sheet using reinsurance to limit big losses. It takes a fixed fee and says this will fund profits instead of the gap between premiums and claims. ""Excess"" profits go to charity.SoftBank needs to squeeze better returns from more of its investments. At the end of the first quarter Lemonade had just over $300m left in cash and short-term investments - enough to fund losses for a few years, but not forever. Its decision to list looks like an attempt to capitalise on the success of ZoomInfo and Vroom. But, more pertinently, there will be concerns that the SoftBank money pitcher is emptying out.",Newspaper
181,Times letters: Furlough scheme's effect on health and work,"May 14, 2020 Thursday",International,thetimes.co.uk,1955,1955,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,WRITE TO LETTERS@THETIMES.CO.UK,Times letters: Furlough scheme's effect on health and work,"Sir, For most people work is generally good for health: equally, for most people worklessness is harmful to both mental and physical health. In my two independent reviews for the government in 2008 and 2011, close study was made of those off work sick, or who had gone further and entered the benefit system, and how they might either be kept in work or returned to it. An important finding was that whatever the initial cause of absence - physical illness, psycho-social factors, or perhaps poor work practices or culture - the number returning to work after more than six weeks' absence was small. Deconditioning began and anxiety about return to work set in. Fear of returning to work was a real barrier.Are there not parallels in this Covid-dominated world? Many individuals will already have lost their jobs but we must not swell their number as we move out of lockdown. Those on furlough are not sick in the way I describe but they are absent from the labour market. Living (effectively) in an expanded benefit system, socially diminished and often without purpose, may exact a high price in the medium or long term. The balance of risk is a difficult one, but let us not move back towards having people become deconditioned and fearful.                    Professor Dame Carol Black                   President, Royal College of Physicians 2002-06; national director for health and work 2006-12; London NW1Sir, Your editorial ""Crisis Crunch"" (May 14) outlines a balanced approach to tackling the deficit caused by Covid-19. There is a further tool available: quantitative easing, to give a modest boost to inflation.Residential property prices could take a hit because the main demographic pressure on accommodation, heavy net migration, has temporarily stopped and is likely to remain lower. Moreover, the trickle of commercial property undergoing conversion could turn into a flood; some firms are already deciding not to return fully to traditional office life.Such a price correction, in a country where housing is so expensive, must be positive in the long term, as it would bring prices back to a more affordable ratio to earnings. Nevertheless, a fall in house prices would be destabilising, potentially further depressing spending. The reliance of many small businesses on loans secured on the proprietor's home could become an additional barrier to recovery.The chancellor should raise the annual target for inflation for the Bank of England by 1 to 2 per cent for the next, say, three years. The Bank could then fund more of the borrowing, mitigating the need for other (painful) measures.                   Sir Julian Brazier                   CanterburySir, It is welcome news that the furlough scheme is to be extended to October. This will provide a hugely important lifeline to many families. However, Standard Life Foundation's financial impact tracker found that four in ten households who had already lost a substantial part of their income as a result of the crisis did not think they would benefit from either the employee furlough or self-employment income support schemes. Other parts of our safety net need to be upgraded, especially universal credit. The chancellor must urgently revisit the schemes he is putting in place to prevent more people falling through the cracks.                   Mubin Haq                   CEO, Standard Life Foundation                   GP SURGERIES 'SHOULD CARRY OUT ALL ANTIBODY TESTS'                   Sir, A blood antibody test for Covid-19 is very welcome but we do not have a strategy in place to test on a large scale (""'Game-changing' antibody test given go-ahead for widespread use"", News, May 14). At the moment these tests are not available in general practice but in Tower Hamlets we have blood-taking ability in every practice, with twice-daily collections for the local hospital laboratory: the results come back within 24 hours to GPs and patients. This needs to be the case in every GP surgery across the country. It would also enable patients to not have to go to the hospital for blood tests and, given the enormous increase in waiting lists, would help to take the pressure off hospitals by managing illness closer to home, which is particularly important for the elderly and those in care homes.Blood testing in general practice needs to be increased urgently, along with swab testing for Covid-19, flu vaccination in October for most of the population and Covid vaccination when it becomes available.                    Professor Sir Sam Everington                   GP and chairman, Tower Hamlets clinical commissioning group, London E3                   MERGING CHARITIES                   Sir, Sir Stephen Bubb (Thunderer, May 13, and letter, May 14) is right to call for more charities to merge. Many small charities are established for laudable reasons but there is huge duplication. Three things need to happen. First, the Charity Commission should challenge those wishing to establish new charities and ask them if their aims could be met by existing charities. Second, the commission should carry out research into one discrete sector, as a test, to see how many charities exist in that sector, how much work is duplicated, and what could be achieved through mergers. Third, the government and the commission should consider making grants available to charities that wish to merge to cover the administrative costs, to act as an inducement.

I support this move but it should be noted that cycling offences are still not adequately covered by the Road Traffic Act. I anticipate this ""new"" cycling strategy being the one drafted in 2018 but shelved for two years because of Brexit. At the time I was assured that it was to include offences of causing death and/or serious injury by dangerous cycling. All the ground work has been done: the legal reports, public consultation and the statutory intergovernmental consultations.These new laws are ready to go. I therefore urge the government to ensure that its promise to introduce legislation is acted upon as we encourage more people to cycle. In that way, when there is wrongdoing by cyclists there will adequate and coherent legal remedies.

But I think the greater concern is how to ensure social distancing among staff, who frequently have to share photocopiers, computers, whiteboards and often cramped staff rooms and eating areas.Schools require a significant number of staff to be able to run safely and effectively. Attention must be given to how everyone, staff included, can return to school without putting themselves at risk.

I graduated with a London University BSc in economics in 1958, ten years before macroeconomic modelling was spawned. Milton Friedman argued that models should be judged only on the accuracy of their predictions. The IMF, the OECD and even the Bank of England have been poor forecasters, particularly recently. More attention should be paid to newer ideas, such as behavioural economics.                   Dr Roger Cox                   Westerham, Kent                   RUSSIANS AND COVID                   Sir, Roger Boyes is wondering why Russian industrialists (he calls them ""oligarchs"") are helping to fight Covid-19 (""Oligarchs flex their muscles as Putin flounders"", Comment, May 13). The fact is that it's natural for big businesses to participate in a nationwide effort to combat an emergency. Authorities, businesses, civil society, private citizens and, of course, health workers are doing what they can to protect lives. This is the case in Britain, France, China and South Korea, and Russia is no different. It is thanks to that effort that Russia has been able to equip the healthcare system with 130,000 dedicated Covid beds and daily testing capacity of about 200,000, and to keep the number of deaths in the low thousands.What matters now is for nations to join efforts in curbing the pandemic and in introducing a vaccine.

The truth is the opposite: since March 19 the Bank of England has been the only source of demand for gilts, having bought £113 billion of them, far more than the Treasury has sold.

182,How to make a musical masterpiece;James Marriott listens in as great songwriters explain the process behind their best lyrics,"June 5, 2020 Friday",International,The Times (London),757,757,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,James Marriott,How to make a musical masterpieceJames Marriott listens in as great songwriters explain the process behind their best lyrics,"podcasts Song Exploder ***** In Writing with Hattie Crisell **** The Spark **** Every couple of months I stumble into the fantasy that I am a music person. ""Yes,"" I think, having read three album reviews, ""I am not the person who spends the majority of his time listening to the same five Taylor Swift songs. I am the person with a deep appreciation of challenging and interesting new music."" Then I sit late into the night stroking my chin while watching YouTube music videos and sending earnest Whatsapp messages to long-neglected group chats recommending to my friends songs that either none of them wants to listen to or that they discovered four years ago.Anyway, I'm in that phase now. So it is under the delusion of my own cultural authority that I recommend you Song Exploder, the excellent music podcast that I've been bingeing on.The idea is that an artist comes on the show and deconstructs the process of writing and recording one of their most famous songs. It's a perfect podcast premise: invariably interesting and endlessly recyclable.The best episode I've listened to had Ezra Koenig from Vampire Weekend talking about Harmony Hall, the lead single from the band's latest album. Vampire Weekend's music is made to be taken apart on a podcast such as this: it's fiddly and stuffed with allusions to other genres, the lyrics make no sense without extensive explanation and Koenig records every musical idea he has on his smartphone. You get to listen to the song progress from a muttered voice note recorded in the street to the lush and beautiful finished thing.I'm betraying my fundamentally depressing music taste by recommending the episodes with Phoebe Bridgers (on the gorgeously despondent Scott Street), Adrianne Lenker of Big Thief (on the achingly forlorn Cattails) and Courtney Barnett (on Depreston - the title speaks for itself). There are forays into classic rock too: Lindsey Buckingham on Go Your Own Way, plus interviews with Liz Phair, Iggy Pop and U2. Yo-Yo Ma even pops up to talk about Bach.If you've been spending the past few months in a stained vest chainsmoking late into the night over your typewriter as you agonise your way through writing the Great Lockdown Novel, you need to listen to In Writing with Hattie Crisell. Crisell chats to journalists, novelists and screenwriters about the practicalities of their craft: where they work, how they work, what they find tough, what comes naturally.I got into the show listening to the episodes with Sathnam Sanghera, Hugo Rifkind and Andrew Billen in the hope of stealing their secrets. If you're a Times fan (which I assume you are if you've made it this far into Times2), those interviews are unmissable.Crisell has also landed a good haul of novelists, including André Aciman (of Call Me by Your Name fame) and Curtis Sittenfeld. She talks about sitting in what she calls her ""Harry Potter cupboard"" battering away at a desktop computer too old to connect to the distracting internet. My favourite interview was with David Nicholls. What a charming man. He talks self-deprecatingly about how he writes lying on a sofa with his laptop propped up on one of those softbottomed trays designed for TV dinners. Anybody who has thought of writing a novel will benefit from his sane, non-intimidating advice.Anyway, I'm finding myself starting to like novelists, which is dangerous for a spunky young literary critic. Grr, bloody David Nicholls and his stupid tray. Remind me to savage his next book.I've realised that I appreciate the BBC much more when I ignore its podcasts and just listen to Radio 4 instead. Helen Lewis's excellent show The Spark interviews ""writers and thinkers breaking new ground"". The latest episode on unconscious bias with the behavioural scientist Pragya Agarwal is especially timely, given the riots in the US. It's fascinating on all the subtle and insidious forms of racism, but also on other biases.For example, Agarwal suggests that procrastination could be thought of as a bias towards the present. And I learnt that while the percentage of Americans reporting that they would be unhappy for their children to have a partner of a different race has fallen dramatically in recent decades, the proportion saying they would be unhappy if their kids married someone of a different political persuasion has risen. Perhaps when we abandon old prejudices we seek out new ones.What a depressing note for this column to finish on. Oh dear. Sorry, everyone.You get to listen to the song progress from a voice note to a lush finished thing",Newspaper
183,"Whether it is in self-interest or the national interest, advertising works","May 13, 2020 Wednesday",International,The Daily Telegraph (London),633,633,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,LINDSEY CLAY,"Whether it is in self-interest or the national interest, advertising works","During life-changing times like these, as the behavioural economist Richard Shotton has observed, people change their consumption habits - and not just because many of us are working nearer our fridges. People become more open to trying new things, or are forced to by circumstance and keep using them afterwards.While habits are being broken and re-established, it's an important time for businesses to be seen, remembered and considered. That's the job of advertising, something that the UK excels at.Advertising lives mostly at the margins of people's lives. In truth, most people don't really care too much about it. Good ads are enjoyed, shared even; average ones are tolerated; bad or intrusive ones rightly rubbished.When advertising is cared about, it is often when it is being made a scapegoat for society's ills. It is cast as a villain.But right now, advertising's role as an economic hero needs to be recognised. Advertising is central to helping the UK economy emerge from this crisis as fit as possible.It is, of course, a challenge to make the case for sustained advertising investment right now when whole sectors are under wraps, like travel.Yet there is a strong case to be made. Indeed, it is vital that those businesses that can advertise do.Advertising is most obviously a self-interested business investment. But it is also in the national interest, especially now. A £1 investment in advertising drives £6 of growth in GDP, according to the Advertising Association. That is a significant contribution.Ad spend is being badly hit by current uncertainty, but there are businesses seizing the lockdown moment. It's the perfect time to de-moss your decking, for example. Pressure washer business Karcher has almost doubled its presence on television recently.Newcomers too, particularly online businesses, are taking advantage of advertising being much cheaper at the moment. Lingerie brand Lively and stationery brand Papier are examples of those making the most of falling prices. With increased viewing - up five hours a week - but demand from sectors like travel dipping, television prices in May/June will be nearly half what they were last year.Likewise, veterans of previous downturns are holding firm. Procter and Gamble has announced it will double-down on advertising. Unilever has already doubled its television ads compared with this time last year. Tesco quickly created excellent lockdown ads to resonate with homebound customers. Budweiser has released a cleverly adapted version of their iconic Whassup ad.All these businesses are generating demand now. But lots of advertising's impact occurs later on. Even if you can't sell a bean at the moment, there is strong financial logic in advertising now if you can, especially at current prices. It takes nerve, but it makes sense. Furniture store SCS, for example, is continuing to advertise despite its stores being closed, primed for when the doors reopen.And there are wider benefits of advertising, too. Yes, there is competitive advantage to gain, revenue to increase, and an economy to help fuel. But advertising sustains so much of the media we value so much: the quality journalism in newsbrands, radio and television; the entertainment that lets us escape for a while. These are treasured parts of our lives, never more so than now. Advertising is also a cultural hero in fact.So, there are many reasons to advertise through the current crisis. From self-interest to the national interest, from its present price to its future-proofing effects. Advertising works and, if we can, now is the time to put it to work.Lindsey Clay is chief executive of Thinkbox, the marketing body for commercial TV in the UK'Advertising is often cast as a villain. But right now, its role as an economic hero needs to be recognised'",Newspaper
184,Coronavirus: the week explained - 15 May;Future vaccine distribution already causing rows... lockdown lifting sees UK split... airlines buckle up for financial trouble,"May 15, 2020 Friday",International,The Guardian (London),1027,1027,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,Ian Sample Science editor,Coronavirus: the week explained - 15 MayFuture vaccine distribution already causing rows... lockdown lifting sees UK split... airlines buckle up for financial trouble,"Welcome to our weekly roundup of developments from the coronavirus pandemic. As new cases emerged in countries that relaxed their restrictions and businesses struggled to weather the storm, the World Health Organization warned that the disease may never go away.                     Vaccine hopes and fears                   An experimental vaccine that is being given to hundreds of people in an accelerated trial has passed an important milestone. A single shot of the Oxford University vaccine was found to protect a small number of monkeys from serious coronavirus infections. The six animals who received the jab produced antibodies to the virus within a month which appeared to prevent lung damage caused by the virus. The virus was still active in the nose, according to a preliminary report posted on the bioRxiv preprint server.The news came days after the UK prime minister, Boris Johnson, conceded that there was no guarantee a vaccine would work, though his chief scientific adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance, was more upbeat, saying: ""I'd be surprised if we didn't end up with something.""A working vaccine is not enough if rich countries buy up all the shots and leave poorer countries unprotected. As a foretaste of the wrangling to come, Paul Hudson, the head of the French pharma company Sanofi caused an outcry when he told Bloomberg News that the US would have first dibs on any vaccine his firm discovered, since the US had funded much of the research. France's minister of higher education, research and innovation, Frédérique Vidal, called the plan ""disgraceful"".                       The Science Weekly podcast asks whether we need more than one vaccine. Hannah Devlin speaks to Prof Andrew Pollard about the work being done by different teams around the world to create a vaccine for Covid-19, and where his team at Oxford University fit into this international effort.                                        Unease over easing                   Disunity reigned in the UK as England broke ranks from the devolved nations over how to lift the lockdown. Johnson told people to return to work if they couldn't work from home, even as the Office of National Statistics revealed that many of those in the PM's sights - construction workers, cleaners, bus drivers and retail workers - were the most likely to die from Covid-19. The Trade Union Congress said the move put people's health at risk as employers had only ""            vague and non-binding "" guidelines on how to protect staff. The first minister of Scotland, Nicola Sturgeon, led a chorus of disapproval and warned that the move was ""potentially catastrophic"".Bewildered experts lambasted Johnson for ditching the simple advice to ""Stay at Home"" for the more puzzling instruction to "" Stay Alert "". A group of behavioural scientists who were convened to advise the government made it clear the slogan hadn't come from them. ""Who is advising on the current messaging? Unfortunately it's not us,"" said one.As commuters packed on to trains and buses, David Hunter, a professor of epidemiology at Oxford University, warned that case numbers           were not low enough to relax restrictions without risking a second wave of infections. Devi Sridhar, a professor of global public health at Edinburgh University,            was similarly aghast, warning that without robust systems to test, trace and isolate those infected, the virus could spread through the population unchecked, resulting in ""a Darwinian culling of the elderly and vulnerable"".                     Every African country now affected                   Health officials in Lesotho announced their first case of coronavirus, meaning the infection has now spread across the entire African continent. The virus was detected in one of 81 people tested after arriving from Saudi Arabia and South Africa.Lesotho went into lockdown on 29 March to prevent the virus spreading from South Africa which entirely surrounds the kingdom and has the most recorded cases on the continent.                     Trump v                      Fauci                   The latest tiff between the US president and Dr Anthony Fauci, the nation's leading infectious disease expert, erupted over the speed at which the country is reopening. Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, made clear that the virus was far from contained a day after Donald Trump declared that the nation had ""prevailed"" against the epidemic. In evidence to a Senate hearing, Fauci went on to warn of dire consequences if the US opened too soon and urged caution over reopening schools. President Trump did not approve. ""To me it's not an acceptable answer, especially when it comes to schools,"" he told reporters.The president himself is taking no chances though. Staff in the West Wing, the operational centre of Trump's administration, have been ordered to wear face masks except when at their own desks. Trump will not be wearing one. One of his valets and vice-president Mike Pence's press secretary have both tested positive for the virus.                     Airlines buckle up                   Willie Walsh, the chief executive of the International Airlines Group, said British Airways would press ahead with cutbacks that could cost 12,000 jobs. Walsh told the chair of the transport committee, Huw Merriman, that despite furlough being extended until October, the financial support wouldn't compensate for ""the reality of a structurally changed airline industry in a severely weakened global economy"".His comments came as Avianca Holdings, Latin America's second biggest airline and one of the oldest in the world, filed for bankruptcy after failing to secure aid from Colombia's government and with a bond payment deadline looming. Avianca would be one of the first major airlines to go under as a result of the pandemic which has caused a 90% decline in global air travel.Meanwhile, Ryanair announced it aimed to restart 40% of its services in July under new rules that require passengers to have temperature tests at the airport, wear face coverings, use hand sanitiser in terminals and ask permission to use the toilet.",Newspaper

So it should be especially clear to the people who created them.""Durham police tried to avoid punishing people for lockdown breaches. It has been one of the forces to issue fewest fines, at about 137 between 27 March and 11 May, compared with North Yorkshire police's 843.Barton said: ""It sounds like Durham police have taken the sensible line of providing advice. One does not need to prosecute in every case.""The acting Durham police, crime and victims' commissioner, Stephen White, said Cummings's trip to Durham was unwise. ""To beat this crisis we need to be selfless, as millions have been,"" he said. ""The response by the people of County Durham and Darlington has been exemplary, which makes this most frustrating and concerning."" Downing Street and Cummings have repeatedly refused to answer questions from the Guardian over a number of weeks about his movements, but Cummings broke his silence on Saturday when he addressed reporters outside his London home. He said he had ""behaved reasonably and legally"" in making the trip.Opposition MPs have accused No 10 of a cover-up and called for the prime minister's top aide to resign.When a reporter suggested to Cummings outside his London home that the trip to Durham did not look good, he replied: ""Who cares about good looks?""It's a question of doing the right thing. It's not about what you guys think. I behaved reasonably and legally.""Downing Street used similar language in a statement on Saturday.A spokesperson said: ""Owing to his wife being infected with suspected coronavirus and the high likelihood that he would himself become unwell, it was essential for Dominic Cummings to ensure his young child could be properly cared for. His sister and nieces had volunteered to help so he went to a house near to but separate from his extended family in case their help was needed.""At no stage was he or his family spoken to by the police about this matter. His actions were in line with coronavirus guidelines. Mr Cummings believes he behaved reasonably and legally.""Durham police said on Friday that officers had ""explained to the family the [lockdown] guidelines"". On Saturday the force said it was standing by its statement and had nothing further to add.The BBC reported that an anonymous source close to Cummings had claimed that a ""small number of people in No 10 knew that Cummings had gone to Durham"". Few more details this morning - -small number of people in No 10 knew that Cummings had gone to Durham, not stayed in London -seems it was his sister who had offered to help with childcare when he and his wife fell ill -family stayed in separate house + had no contact in the end- Laura Kuenssberg (@bbclaurak) May 23, 2020This prompted the Scottish National party's Westminster leader, Ian Blackford, to accuse Downing Street of trying to suppress the story.Blackford said: ""What I find interesting ... is that members of Downing Street knew about this, so first and foremost Boris Johnson has serious questions to answer over what now appears to be a cover-up.""Responding to No 10's statement, a spokesperson for the Labour party said: ""The lockdown rules were very clear. If you or anyone in your household was suspected of having Covid-19 you must immediately self-isolate and not leave the house. However, the prime minister's chief adviser appears to believe that it is one rule for him and another for the British people.""This will cause understandable anger for the millions of people who have sacrificed so much during this crisis.""No 10's statement also raises more questions than it answers. We are still unclear who knew about this decision and when, whether this was sanctioned by the prime minister and whether No 10 is now questioning the validity of the statement from Durham police.""At this afternoon's press conference, we will be expecting answers to these questions.""The Guardian first approached Downing Street for a comment in April after being told by a neighbour of Cummings's parents that they had seen him at the Durham property on 5 April.No 10 refused to discuss the issue at the time. A spokesman said: ""It'll be a no comment on that one. We wouldn't get into location of individual members of staff.""Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Blackford said: ""The prime minister must explain exactly when he knew about the breaking of the rules, whether he sanctioned it, why Cummings wasn't sacked immediately and why it appears that he tried to cover it up, not telling the public until the newspaper[s] broke the story eight weeks later last night.""Dave Penman, the general secretary of the FDA, the union that represents senior civil servants, said Johnson had a duty to explain Cummings's behaviour.He told Today: ""I think the prime minister needs to understand how heartbreaking this lockdown has been for so many families and the sacrifices that have been made up and down the country.""I think in these circumstances, if it looks like there is one rule for those at the centre of government and one rule for the rest of the country, then really the prime minister has a responsibility, as well as a constitutional responsibility, to explain his actions. He has known about this for six weeks.""Plaid Cymru and the Liberal Democrats have also called for Cummings to resign or be sacked. One Tory MP said: ""I won't be lifting a finger to defend him.""They suggested Cummings would find few defenders in the parliamentary Conservative party. ""He isn't popular with most Tory MPs. The radio silence on the Tory MP WhatsApp group since the story broke is pretty telling. The issue is he's increasingly becoming the story. The cardinal sin of any Spad [special adviser].""The foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, accused opponents of Cummings of trying politicise his behaviour. He tweeted : ""It's reasonable and fair to ask for an explanation on this. And it has been provided: two parents with coronavirus were anxiously taking care of their young child. Those now seeking to politicise it should take a long hard look in the mirror.""His cabinet colleague Michael Gove tweeted : ""Caring for your wife and child is not a crime.""Prof Susan Michie, of University College London, who is a member of Sage, the scientific group that has guided the government's response to the coronavirus, suggested Cummings's trip would undermine trust in the official advice on the outbreak.

How to behave as UK lockdown eases;Etiquette and behavioural experts on how people should respond as the Covid-19 restrictions are lifted","July 3, 2020 Friday",International,The Guardian (London),847,847,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,Sam Wollaston,"Hug, bump - or wave? How to behave as UK lockdown easesEtiquette and behavioural experts on how people should respond as the Covid-19 restrictions are lifted","You've been invited round to someone's house for a barbecue. Then maybe to watch the match, because now, as lockdown eases further, you can be indoors with other people too - as far as you can figure out, from the government guidance, which is over 5,000 words long for England alone.Yes, here: ""Indoors in groups of up to two households ... you should continue to maintain social distancing."" Hmm, not sure how 2 metres is going to work on their sofa. Or ""1 metre-plus"", whatever that looks like.This new lockdown relaxation throws up a whole fresh load of anxiety: about the virus itself, whether you're going to get it, and whether easing is a good idea or a fast track to a second spike.But also how are you supposed to behave? How do you greet the other household - smile and a wave, elbow bump, or fully-eased hug. What do you bring - your own plates, food, PPE?Jo Bryant, etiquette expert, handily condenses it down to three Cs: consideration, communication and confidence. ""If you're hosting something you have a duty to make sure people can have the option to socially distance. And the option - if they're not comfortable - to maybe bring drinks or their own cutlery or even food. You need to be very open and loose with the arrangements, allow people to have those options.""Communication is about telling people what to expect, or about how you've been at home, ""making sure people realise you are aware that people might have different levels of comfort"".She mentions a picture of a wedding that did the rounds, in which people wore different coloured wristbands depending on levels of contact they were comfortable with, from green (""OK with hugs and high fives"") to red (""Hi! I'm keeping my distance"").""Confidence is that very unBritish thing of having the confidence to say what you think,"" says Bryant, confidently. ""People are putting themselves out of their comfort zone and possibly even breaking the rules because they don't want to offend."" If you're not happy about the bottle of ketchup that's gone through five pairs of hands, don't have ketchup. Same with distance, stick to what you're comfortable with, respect what others are.What about that greeting? ""Normally I'd give you a hug but I can't, ha ha ha,"" is one suggestion from Bryant. ""We are coming out of lockdown, we've got a bit of feelgood, approaching it with humour and lightheartedness is a good way of communicating what you're comfortable with.""Dr Charlotte Hilton, a behavioural psychologist, says that while more freedom is preferable for many, it will also cause increased anxiety about what to do and how to behave. ""I guess the recommendation from a psychology point of view is take the point of keeping yourself and other people safe as the starting point."" That might mean wearing a face mask in public, certainly on public transport, hand washing etc.""It has to be a personal decision,"" Hilton says. ""Some of the difficulty is a lot of these decisions are based on trust in the government, which is notoriously problematic. Particularly when there seems to be this incongruence between science and government, health and economy, it makes the decision-making process more difficult.""Harder still if your decision-making's a bit wobbly. ""After a few drinks in the pub it's reasonable to think that attention might very well reduce,"" says Hilton. ""Therefore what we have is much more dangerous behaviour and I think that's what most people are concerned about.""Professor of health psychology at UCL, Susan Michie, who sits on the government's Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), acknowledges the psychological importance of socialising. ""It is really important, and one of the mental-health costs of the pandemic has been isolation and loneliness, especially for younger people, especially for younger men ... The issue is about how to enable that in a way that the risk level is commensurate with the situation we are in at the moment.""She points to the still relatively high rate of transmission, that a vast majority of it happens indoors, the lack of a fully functioning test, trace and isolate system. And to the fact that alcohol disinhibits behaviour. ""So even for those people who have gone out with really good intentions to keep socially distant, wash their hands frequently, not touch other people etc, after two or three drinks we know that will be out the window.""Visiting another household of people you know and trust is one thing, the pub is another. In a situation of risk assessment and risk management, opening pubs is ""the top of the hierarchy of riskiness,"" she says. ""I think it is a recipe for disaster.""Michie is not impressed with the government's decision-making on easing then, especially when it comes to indoor pubs. It's too soon. But what about us, how should we behave? She has more faith in us, pointing out how many people locked down before being told to. ""I say carry on exercising your good judgment like you did when you locked down before the government asked,"" she says. ""Avoid pubs despite the government saying it's fine to go to them.""",Newspaper

Prof Voyer said: ""In a pandemic, you suddenly shift from promotion to prevention - you pay much more attention to what could go wrong, and that change of mindset affects a lot of decisions you are making. ""If you are not somebody who naturally stockpiles, you might start to do so."" He added: ""In addition to this, one could add a rise in anxiety levels and stress, which also affect buying behaviours."" He said the lockdown could see more people stop using cash.",Newspaper
188,Tossing a coin on life-changing decisions leads to better outcomes,"May 18, 2020 Monday",International,The Daily Telegraph (London),497,497,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,Daily Telegraph Reporter,Tossing a coin on life-changing decisions leads to better outcomes,"LIFE decisions chosen on the outcome of a coin toss leads to people being happier, a study has found.Researchers found that people who use a coin-flip to rule on an important change in their lives are more likely to follow through with that decision, are more satisfied with that decision, and report a higher overall happiness six months later.The study found while behavioural economics offers several decisionmaking models, it says little about people's overall happiness with their choices after they make important resolutions.As part of the study, Steven Levitt, an economist at the University of Chicago, created a website, called Freakonomics Experiments, where people answered a series of questions such as ""Should I move?"" or ""Should I quit my job?"" Before the coin toss, the participants were encouraged to identify a third party to verify their outcomes. Both the initial coin-flipper and the third parties received a follow-up survey after two months and six months.Other questions included ""Should I propose?"", while users were also invited to create their own questions, including ""Should I get a tattoo?"", ""Should I try online dating?"" or ""Should I rent or buy?"".One choice, either the affirmative or the negative, was then assigned to heads and the other assigned to tails.The two-month survey found that participants favoured the status quo, making a change less frequently than they predicted they would before the coin toss.But at the six-month survey, the bias toward the status quo was gone. And those who were instructed by the coin toss to switch their current position were more likely to make the change, reported that they were substantially happier, and said that they were more likely to make the same decision if they were to choose again.That was true for virtually every question at both the two and six-month surveys, according to the study. The research team said that the results are ""inconsistent"" with the conventional theory of choice. In such theory, people who are on the margins should, on average, report equal happiness - regardless of which decision they made.Prof Levitt said: ""Society teaches us 'quitters never win and winners never quit', but in reality the data from my experiment suggests we would all be better off if we did more quitting.""A good rule of thumb in decision making is whenever you cannot decide what you should do, choose the action that represents a change, rather than continuing the status quo."" Making decisions based on the toss of a coin is synonymous with Two-Face, a fictional supervillain and adversary of Batman, who is reliant on flipping his signature coin in order to make decisions.In 2016, Hillary Clinton, the former Democratic presidential nominee, secured victory over Bernie Sanders in six precincts at the Iowa caucus via coin tosses when the votes were too close to decide a clear winner.Prof Levitt's findings were published in The Review of Economic Studies, published by Oxford University Press.",Newspaper

Clare Thorpexplains","t a time when so many of us are deprived of physical contact, it seems a little cruel that one of the most talked-about TV shows of the year so far features so much of it. Or perhaps that's exactly why Normal People the TV adaptation of Sally Rooney's bestselling novel has captivated so many viewers. Released in late April, demand to stream the 12-part BBC series was such that it helped iPlayer to record its most successful week ever. On its release it dominated virtual water-cooler chat in WhatsApp groups and on social media. Its story follows the relationship between two characters, Marianne Sheridan (played by Daisy EdgarJones) and Connell Waldron (Paul Mescal), throughout their teenage years and early 20s. It's a show about intimacy, both emotional and physical, with 41 minutes of sex scenes across six hours of television. Rooney's book was such a hit that the TV equivalent was always going to command attention yet somehow its timing seemedAespecially perfect, COSY TV providing escapism --when we've most The Great Celebrity needed it.

TV, films and books that would help get us through our time in lockdown. While it's not true that everyone has more time on their hands (yes, Shakespeare may have written King Lear while in quarantine during the plague, but he didn't have to check into five Zoom meetings while homeschooling his children and trying to secure an Ocado delivery slot), it is the case that most social activities are on hold, making the culture we consume in our homes more important than ever, not just to keep us entertained, but also to maintain our sanity. `Seeking distraction to escape the uncomfortable feelings that anxiety generates is common,' says clinical psychologist Dr Nihara Krause. `Entertainment that holds your focus is a good distractor.'We're fortunate enough to be holed-up at a time when we've never had so much entertainment to distract us, and the evidence shows we're taking full advantage. Research by Havas Media in March showed 49 per cent of people were watching more live TV during the crisis, and 39 per cent were using streaming platforms more. Netflix added 16 million subscribers worldwide in the first quarter of 2020 double its target. And Disney+ launched in the UK in late March, at the perfect time for families suddenly housebound. On 10 May, more than 27.5 million people tuned in to Boris Johnson's address on the UK's easing of lockdown restrictions, making it one of the most-watched television broadcasts in British history, but shows such as MasterChef, The Great Celebrity Bake Off for Stand Up To Cancer, Antiques Roadshow and The Repair Shop have also drawn large audiences, suggesting we're craving cosy, comfort viewing right now. Or in the case of Normal People shows that take us to another time. Although it is a BBC Three production predominantly aimed at the 25-and-under demographic viewing figures show that two-thirds of the 16 million requests to stream the series in its first week were from those aged 35 and over. The actors might be fresh-faced, but many of the people watching it are actually reminiscing about their youth. According to neuropsychologist Professor Catherine Loveday from the University of Westminster, there are many reasons why that time of life has such a hold over us. `We romanticise that period, even though it's often tricky and most people would not voluntarily go through it again,' she says. `But it's when we form our identity. We make critical and lifelong decisions like what jobs we want to do, where we want to live, who we want to be friends with. You're working out who you are away from your family, and deciding your views on politics, society and culture.' Our first memories of anything are always more powerful, and our teens and early 20s are full of firsts. `When you ask people about memories from their life, those are the ones that come up most often,'says Loveday. `We revisit those experiences as a way of solidifying our sense of who we are.' It als o make s sense that we might want to escape the present and remindourselves of a time when the world felt wide open to us. `Nostalgia is a bittersweet emotion, but for the majority of people it has a positive impact,' says Loveday. When the world feels so uncertain, we want to be in a place where things feel familiar and wallowing in nostalgia is like curling up under our favourite blanket. `It's a safe place to go. It's predictable, we know what happens there.' There's another reason we want to travel back into the past right now. `Our ability to imagine the future uses the same brain anatomy as remembering the past,' says Loveday. `When you throw yourself back in time it's like your window expands and you can then see yourself further forward as well. If you can remember what life was like 20 years ago, suddenly the past three months shrink. You're changing the scale on which you're judging everything and it makes it easier to see the other side of this.' We're not just turning to our screens to look at our past but to educate ourselves, too. There's been a rise in `edutainment', with more of us watching educational and cultural programmes to keep our brains ticking. Other forms of entertainment are also on the rise. Research by The Reading Agency found 31 per cent of us are reading more during lockdown. Waterstones reported increased demand for classic titles, such as Gabriel García Márquez's Love in the Time of Cholera, Toni Morrison's Beloved and F Scott Fitzgerald's The Great Gatsby. People are tackling Hilary Mantel's The Mirror and the Light weighing in at 912 pages in their droves.

Behavioural scientist and psychologist Professor Ben Voyer, from ESCP Business School, explains that the brain's attention is divided between a prevention focus, concerned with stopping bad things from happening, and a promotion focus, where we look forward to things. Right now, we're in survival mode, so the prevention focus is tipping the balance, especially as we can't plan or look forward to much at the moment. In this instance, stories provide a much-needed break when other options, like meeting a friend, are not possible. `When you're looking for something that can take you away from your current focus and provide some comfort, then stories are a very good thing to go for because they have this ability to transport us outside of this to somewhere else.' For all those finding solace in books, there are also some who are struggling. Newsnight's Emily Maitlis echoed the feelings of many when she tweeted: `I'm finding it really hard to read at the moment and I usually devour novels. Is anyone else?' That's to be expected, says Voyer. Right now our brains are busy prioritising the information that we need to stay safe. `That means stuff that is a bit more positive goes in the background, because naturally, it's not the thing that you're going to find most useful.' And while a bit of stress can be beneficial, the amount many of us are under right now is not. `Excessive stress can have a detrimental effect over people's ability to concentrate. The brain is constantly firing warning signals that take precedence over any other form of relaxing information.' For some, revisiting TV shows, music and books they already know and love has been the answer.

Instead, it can feel better to watch something far removed from our everyday lives, something so weird that you forget about your own reality at least for a while. Step forward Netflix's Tiger King: Murder, Mayhem and Madness. If Normal People is the show we can relate too, this series about a bunch of eccentric exotic-animal owners is one that is hopefully a million miles from reality for most of us. The eight-part documentary series follows the explosive rivalries between big-cat owners in Florida and features hairstyles almost as terrifying as the creatures. When it appeared on Netflix towards the end of March it soon became the platform's most-watched show and its star, Joe Exotic, has emerged as one of the most talked-about and recognisable figures of quarantine life. But why has this bizarre true tale proved so popular? Mareike Jenner, senior lecturer in media studies at Anglia Ruskin University, says its weirdness makes it the perfect piece of culture for us to bond over. `In times when most of our conversation is so dominated by one thing, it seems like a good topic to focus on,' she explains. `It's mostly successful in giving us something else to think and talk about.' More than ever, culture is a vehicle for staying connected to others. Under lockdown we're embracing `live' TV again and the experience of watching shows at the same time as everyone else. Quiz a dramatisation of the 2001 Who Wants To Be a Millionaire? scandal drew in nearly nine million viewers for its first episode, making it the biggest drama of the year for ITV so far and leading toan upswing in the popularity of the actual programme on TV.

The government is undermining its own credibility","May 14, 2020 Thursday",International,The Guardian (London),602,602,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,Editorial,"The Guardian view on pandemic secrecy: wrong and counterproductiveIn the battle against Covid-19, transparency about the facts is key to maintaining public support. The government is undermining its own credibility","The official documents consisted of line after line of blacked out information. They gave every appearance of top secret cold war papers from which the slightest hint that might be useful to an enemy had been redacted. In reality, though, they were nothing more than part of            a report by behavioural scientists on how the British public might respond to Covid-19 lockdown measures. With heavy irony, they were published last week as part of an attempt to be more transparent.The language of war has been too common throughout the Covid-19 crisis, never more than in the mouth of Boris Johnson, a leader who is happier trading in florid metaphors than in plain facts and practical details. Yet there is a huge difference between a war and the pandemic. In a real war there is a human enemy. In the pandemic there is a viral one. This difference is crucial when it comes to mobilising the public's support.In a war, the enemy craves vital information. As a result, the national effort must indeed often be kept secret, plans concealed and information controlled. In a fight to preserve the national health, however, openness is all. Transparency is fundamental to good decision-making about an elusive enemy. It is also vital to ensuring national confidence, so that the public cooperates with evidence-based restrictions and sacrifices - including control over their own data - that can help bring the viral scourge to an end.British governments have never been at ease with openness, and this continuing unease is now significantly affecting and weakening the national effort, especially as the lockdown is loosened in England. Too much is being subordinated to ""comms strategy"". This is not just wrong in principle, but counterproductive in practice. It is wrong because the public has a right to know about the threat and to take highly personal decisions which are laden with risk. And it is counterproductive because it disables ministers from the very task - gathering information in order to act rationally and effectively to combat the virus - in which public confidence and cooperation are most essential.But the secrecy persists. It was always ridiculous that the membership of the government's Sage advisory committee was kept secret. The Guardian's revelation of the names this month has had no adverse public consequences and at least one positive one, since we now know that Sage members were not asked to approve the new message to England to stay alert. Whitehall has now published            an incomplete list of names.Even less defensible is the fact that the government continues to keep most of Sage's key papers and some of its most recent conclusions secret, despite occasional promises to publish them. The findings of the Exercise Cygnus test drill in 2016, which exposed a health sector that could be overwhelmed by a pandemic, have long been suppressed, when they could have made possible a more effective resilience strategy that might have saved lost lives. The documents published last week revealed only that No 10 is politically paranoid about losing hold of the debate.Yet these papers and conclusions are ""the science"" that the government still claims to be following in its Covid-19 policy. They are documents which ought ideally to provide a gold standard of credibility that ministers are doing the right thing. Yet the public cannot see what they say and the conclusions, where they are known, are            open to challenge. As long as this continues, ministers risk precisely the loss of trust that has been such a mark of this most troubling week in the crisis.",Newspaper

This fine study uses the health records of 17m anonymised UK citizens, links to data on later fatalities, and can be read on the web by anyone who understands hazard ratios.The authors show that sheer age is far more important than underlying health conditions. Going in age from the 40s to the 70s is associated on average with a 15-fold rise in risk of Covid-19 death, after adjusting for all health conditions, obesity, race and other influences. This can be thought of as the ""pure"" age-risk effect. The authors estimate the effects of conditions like uncontrolled diabetes at a two-fold rise; recently diagnosed cancer as between a two-fold rise and a three-fold rise; having had a stroke at a two-fold rise; and chronic heart disease at a 1.3-fold rise.

192,Happiness is making big decisions on flip of a coin,"May 18, 2020 Monday",International,The Times (London),494,494,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,Rhys Blakely,Happiness is making big decisions on flip of a coin,"It is sometimes said that quitters never win and winners never quit. Do not believe it: a novel experiment has suggested that many of us would be happier if we were brave enough to ditch the status quo.Behavioural economists have long pondered what motivates people to make or resist life-changing decisions, such as whether it is the right time to walk away from a relationship or start a family. Little evidence had been gathered, however, on how well we make these choices.To fill this gap, Steven Levitt, a professor of economics at the University of Chicago and a co-author of the best-selling book Freakonomics, created an experiment. ""What I did is extremely simple,"" he said. ""People who couldn't decide which choice to make on some life decision came to my website - and I tossed a coin for them.""More than 22,000 people in a quandary flipped a virtual coin. Professor Levitt included a number of readymade questions, including ""should I quit my job?"" ""should I propose?"" and ""should I adopt a child?"" Users were also invited to create their own. Their queries included ""should I get a tattoo?"" and ""should I try online dating?"" One answer, either yes or no, was assigned to heads and the other to tails.Prior to the coin toss, the subjects were also encouraged to identify a third party to verify that they were being honest.Both the coin-flippers and the third parties then received follow-up surveys after two and six months.According to a study published today in the Review of Economic Studies, the random outcome of the coin tosses appeared to influence the actions taken.Nearly 14,000 subjects completed the two-month survey and nearly two thirds of them said that they had followed the recommendation of the coin toss. This was significantly higher than the 50 per cent you would expect from chance alone.People tended to resist change: only about 50 per cent of those told to make a change did so, while 75 per cent of those told to maintain the status quo followed the coin's recommendation.At six months, however, following the coin toss to make an important change - such as leaving a relationship or starting one's own business - was linked to a significant increase in happiness.The results come with caveats. The pool of subjects was not representative of society in general and there is no way to be certain that they were telling the truth. Overall, though, Professor Levitt believes that his results shed new light on decision-making.""The people who were randomised into the make-a-change [group] by the outcome of the coin toss report being happier overall after six months and are much more satisfied with the choice they made,"" he said.""The data from my experiment suggests we would all be better off if we did more quitting,"" he added.

His urge to control threats sprang from a frightening, violent childhood. He has written that his heroin-addicted mother beat him and his sister regularly, shot his stepfather and killed herself when he was 16.He moved in with a friend's family where the mother, the singer Rosemary Clooney, gave him a job as her road manager.

But what do we know about how the system works and if it will be ready by next week?                     What is contact tracing - is is just about a new phone app?                   No. The NHS app being trialled on the Isle of Wight is a very useful addition to contact tracing, but no replacement for human beings who will get in touch with people who may have been in contact with those who have coronavirus symptoms.                     Is the contact tracing system ready to go?                   Not yet. The health and social care secretary, Matt Hancock, said 25,000 telephone contact tracers had been recruited - more than the 18,000 he set as a target - although we do not know whether they have all been trained and are ready to start work. However, the much-discussed NHS app that is supposed to alert people who have been close to somebody who has Covid-19, has been delayed and will not be ready until 1 June. Last Thursday, Prof John Newton, of Public Health England, told the Downing Street briefing there were advantages to starting one part of the operation ahead of the other.                     How important is the app?                   The government initially set great store by it. Hancock is known to be a great fan of technology. It was hoped it would make the work of contact tracing much easier, but the trial on the Isle of Wight has thrown up problems. For one thing, it appears the app does not work so well with Google- and Apple-operated phones.                     What will the call handlers do?                   They will work from home initially, and possibly in call centres later. They will be given the details of somebody who has tested positive for Covid-19 and call them to find out whom they have met in the previous two days. The call handlers will phone those people and advise them and their family to self-isolate for 14 days. They should then check on them regularly to ask how they are and whether they are coping. If any of those contacts becomes ill, the call handlers will ask them in turn for the names and numbers of people they have been with.                     Will people who get a call and are told to self-isolate cooperate?                   Some will and some may not. A pilot project run by a group of doctors in Sheffield found a number of problems, including a reluctance by some people to self-isolate when it meant being unable to earn money. Several of those people were working in care homes.Many public health doctors think the tracing schemes should be run at local authority level, by people who are part of the community and will be better able to find and support people, rather than call handlers who may be located in a different part of the country. Contact tracing in the past has been done by local environmental and public health officers.                     Will Dominic Cummings' decision to travel 264 miles to Durham to self-isolate                      make it more difficult for call handlers to persuade people to stay                     at home                     ?                   That is the fear of some behavioural scientists. Some families may think if he can interpret the rules how he likes, then so can they.",Newspaper

He said: ""I think the real problem here is not simply in what Mr Cummings did but in the messaging that the Prime Minister put out.

198,Footprints are leading us to a clearer picture of the past,"May 15, 2020 Friday",International,The Independent (United Kingdom),552,552,England & Wales,DAVID KEYS,Footprints are leading us to a clearer picture of the past,"The remarkable investigation into more than 400 prehistoric human footprints in east Africa, carried out by American scientists, showcases an extraordinary and exciting new and emerging aspect of archaeology.In the past, virtually all knowledge about our pre-agricultural Stone Age past has come from the study of stone and other tools, food debris, human skeletal material, bone and ivory sculptures, and of course rock and the cave art.But over the past four decades (and especially over the past 15 years), a new ""sub-discipline"" has emerged - the study of prehistoric footprints.As forensic-style expertise has grown, so has the amount of new knowledge that can be extracted from such prints. Over recent years, literally thousands have come to light.This new way of uncovering the secrets of the distant past is enabling scientists to extract behavioural, economic and social dynamics information that they would rarely have been able to obtain from other types of archaeological work.Using 3D laser scanning, 3D photogrammetry, sophisticated computer software and geomorphological as well, as archaeological skills, investigators have increasingly been able to reconstruct the daily lives of people who lived thousands and sometimes hundreds of thousands or even millions of years ago.With these emerging techniques, they are now often able to calculate how fast the ancient ""footprint-makers"" were moving across a given landscape, how heavy or tall they were, sometimes approximately how old they were and often which sex they probably were.What's more, sometimes investigators can even work out the individual's gait, their foot morphology and even what injuries their feet had sustained.And all this data, when analysed in conjunction with more conventional archaeological information, can often help determine the sorts of economic and social activities, the prehistoric footprint-makers were engaged in.The oldest human footprints in the world (from Laetoli in Tanzania) date back over 3 million years - some in Kenya 1.5 million years.The oldest in Britain (in East Anglia) date back to between 800,000 and 1 million years ago - with examples from Italy and South Africa, clocking in at 350,000 and 120,000 years, respectively.In western France, archaeologists have even been able to study Neanderthal footprints - and in Mexico some potentially 40,000-year-old prints could help determine the dating of the original peopling of the Americas.Yet more prehistoric footprints have been discovered over recent years in Australia, Nicaragua, Namibia, South Korea and Argentina.The Namibian example is unique - as it reveals the day-to-day activities of a group of children and teenagers (some as young as five years of age) who, when they left their footprints in some mud, were busy following a group of goats 15 centuries ago.The Tanzanian Laetoli prints also involved a child - and archaeologists have suggested that the arrangement of his or her prints shows that he or she was engaged in play. If so, it would demonstrate that human childhood playfulness substantially predates the emergence of our own species.Footprints from the distant past have a unique capacity to almost photographically record candid unrehearsed aspects of daily life long ago. They are, in a way, snapshots from the Stone Age.",Newspaper
199,OPINION KATE WILLS;Our columnist on why there is no such thing as a right or wrong decision,"May 31, 2020 Sunday",International,The Sun (England),640,640,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,,OPINION KATE WILLSOur columnist on why there is no such thing as a right or wrong decision,"I've been chronically indecisive in the past. I'd overthink every choice, umm-ing and ahh-ing, making detailed lists of pros and cons. And that was just about what to watch on Netflix that night. Big decisions would fill me with panic. Should I have a baby? Should I leave my job and go freelance? Should I emigrate to California? And I'd agonise over them, sometimes for years. I'd even Google: ""How to make a decision"". It wasn't helpful. People would say: ""Go with your gut"", but mine never told me anything useful, other than that it was time for another snack.When I eventually made the decision to leave my marriage two years ago, I realised that there is no such thing as a ""right"" call. There is no perfect outcome, just choices you make that move things in a different direction. I realised that sticking with the status quo is also a decision, just a passive one. Both have consequences - good and bad. I think our 30s, especially for women, can feel fraught with panic, because it seems like we have to make all these huge life-changing decisions, in an ever-narrowing window of time.Lockdown has been the catalyst for a lot of people to make big changes in their lives, and I'm not just talking about the fact that every third person on my Instagram seems to have bought a dog. Plans we've been mulling over for ages have finally been actioned, no doubt in part because the global pandemic has made us realise what's really important to us. I have a friend who's decided to move out of London, another who has begun the process to adopt. Of course, there's also the predicted baby boom and divorce spike when this is all over - two monumental life changes, with completely different results.Last week, a study was published that found that people who were randomly told to make a big change were happier than those who stuck with the way things were. Behavioural economist Steven Levitt, co-author of Freakonomics, flipped a virtual coin for 22,000 people who were in a quandary. Questions included: ""Should I get a tattoo?"", ""Should I propose?"" and ""Should I start my own business?"" Six months later, the respondents who'd been told to make the change - and had actually done it - reported being significantly more satisfied with life than those who'd followed the ""if in doubt, do nowt"" approach.It might sound trivial to flip the coin or roll the dice in order to make an important choice, but is it any worse than our other decision-making techniques? Apparently, the ancient Persians made big decisions by discussing them twice - once while drunk and then again while sober. I know a few break-ups that have definitely been fuelled by the choices made over wine.Since my own core-shakingly big life change, I find it much easier to make decisions (thank god, because indecision is exhausting). The pandemic has helped me to realise that we don't actually need to sweat decision-making, because the really impactful things in life - ill health, bereavement, redundancy - we have no choice in at all. The big decisions make themselves. There is no such thing as a wrong move and you're never truly stuck or without options. So if lockdown has made you rethink your priorities, perhaps now's the time to try to change something, anything. To toss a coin and not look back.

200,Public trust in government advice has been trashed,"May 27, 2020 Wednesday",International,The Independent (United Kingdom),515,515,England & Wales,EDITORIAL,Public trust in government advice has been trashed,"It must have been a tough call for Dominic Cummings and Boris Johnson: should the prime minister's most senior aide issue an apology, or something resembling one, for his breaking the rules on lockdown?To his credit, in a way, Mr Cummings, deploying the cool logic for which he is renowned, saw no reason to express regret, contrition or make any apology because, in his view, he didn't do anything wrong. He didn't even try to appease an angry public with what might be called a ""Tony Blair"" or ""Priti Patel"" version - ""I'm sorry if people feel that way"".Hence the harsh headlines and growing mood of resentment. One opinion poll that registered a vote of 52 per cent for Mr Cummings to leave his job now shows that 59 per cent want him gone. Some are asking questions about whether he was as prescient about the coronavirus pandemic as he claims to be.The furore is not dying down, and shortly Mr Johnson will face the Commons Liaison Committee, who will rightly want to know how much responsibility he takes for his nominal underling, what he knew and when, and exactly why this Svengali-like figure is judged so indispensable that he is placed above the law. The investigation of the facts by Durham Police may shed yet more light on those.Conservative MPs are mostly unimpressed by Mr Cummings's version of events - not least because the protests from constituents are still pouring in, and those in marginal seats may be especially concerned about any lasting resentment. Michael Gove, the man most responsible for inveigling Mr Cummings into power, made a poor show of justifying a 30-mile ride to Barnard Castle as an obvious way for someone to try to check their eyesight; he made a tall story sound sillier. Cabinet colleagues, MPs, Tory grassroots and voters alike may wonder why they are being gaslighted in this way. They are not foolish enough to believe that Mr Cummings acted in a reasonable and legal way, and certainly not that he acted ""with integrity"". Everything Mr Cummings achieved in his trip to Durham could have been accomplished if he had obeyed the rules and stayed at home in London. He risked spreading the virus in his various visits, and the ""Cummings effect"" is eroding the continuing official advice about social distancing and staying at home.As the exit strategy from lockdown gathers pace, this damage to the credibility of official advice may prove catastrophic. If a second wave of infections does overwhelm the NHS in the coming weeks, then the government will not be able to offload the blame. The political consequences of a Lombardy-style collapse are unknowable.Even now, on the best of the measurements, the UK has suffered one of the worst per capita mortality rates in the world. The level of infections and the R rate are still too high, relative to the test-and-trace infrastructure, yet the lockdown is still being eased, and the government's credibility is now trashed, as the Sage behavioural scientists say, by Mr Cummings's actions. The government is running too many risks with other people's lives: Mr Cummings is part of the problem.",Newspaper

Adam Tomkins, a senior Scottish Conservative in charge of liaising with Downing Street, said losing Mr Ross was ""a disaster"" and showed ""exactly why Cummings should be sacked"".Donald Cameron, the party's finance spokesman, tweeted ""well done, my friend"" to Mr Ross while Murdo Fraser, the constitution spokesman, Graham Simpson, the housing spokesman, Finlay Carson, the climate change spokesman, and Liz Smith, the chief whip, all called for Mr Cummings to resign.Ms Smith said that she had been contacted by 200 constituents angry about the adviser's apparent flouting of lockdown rules.Mr Carlaw had handed Scottish Conservative MSPs permission to criticise Mr Cummings provided they did so in a ""personal capacity"". He refused to comment on whether Mr Cummings's actions were improper but also declined to endorse his explanation for the journeys as being credible.""I think that his position as he articulated it was an understandable one but there clearly is a concern that irrespective of whether or not he acted legally or otherwise, people have to know that everybody is acting without fear or favour with respect to obeying the rules,"" he told STV News. ""And I think the continuing debate about that is what's creating the distraction. I think we need to turn our attention now to fighting the virus and I think that the way forward is to do what I would do if I were in his position and I would now be considering my position.""A government behavioural scientist has said that Mr Johnson has put his own self-interest over saving lives by refusing to sack Mr Cummings.Stephen Reicher, professor of social psychology at the University of St Andrews and a government strategist, said Britain faces another deadly outbreak if the prime minister fails to sack his political aide for apparently breaching rules. The academic's criticism was made as Ramsay Jones, a former UK government special adviser on Scotland, said that Mr Cummings has now become ""a massive distraction"" after his ""Swiss cheese"" defence.Most Tory MSPs backed the intervention of Mr Carlaw, who faced a backlash at the weekend for failing to take a decisive position. However, he was criticised by Michelle Ballantyne, who was defeated by Mr Carlaw in this year's leadership election, in a private Whatsapp group of politicians.""Mob rule then - I'm sure the PM will be delighted with your advice,"" she wrote. ""It will come as no surprise that I have more time for a PM who is loyal to his adviser and will not give way to this blood sucking media frenzy.""George Adam, the SNP chief whip, said: ""It is only under public pressure, and a mutiny among his own ranks, that Jackson Carlaw conceded that the UK government should be held to the same standards he expects of others.""Alister Jack, the Scottish secretary, thanked Mr Ross for his work as a minister. He declined to comment further.",Newspaper

Tui's website says passengers can apply for a cash refund, if ""unable to accept a refund credit"". Legally, anyone with cancelled flights is entitled to apply.In order to do so, you fill out a refund request form online after having received your refund credit code.You cannot apply for a cash refund without a refund credit code.You should receive an email with ""all the relevant information"" four weeks from your original departure date, including the refund code.Refunds can also be requested via phone, on 0203 451 2868. Phone lines are open Monday to Friday from 9am to 7pm, and refund codes must be provided by the customer.However, the website warns: ""call waiting times are considerably longer than usual"". Callers can expect to be on hold for several hours before getting through, as is true for most travel firms at the moment.""It's a subtle bit of behavioural economics pushing people to take the voucher and make them jump through hoops to get an actual cash refund,"" said savings expert Martin Lewis on BBC Radio 5.His advice to passengers is to consider whether they can accept a credit refund, as this is likely to save them a lot of hassle.On its website, Tui says most refunds should be completed by June 1. Those with complications -such as lost or expired payment cards -should be completed by June 15. Later refund requests should take 28 days.Passengers who booked through a third party must contact the booking party directly, as refund policies may differ.                      How does the credit refund work?                   Refund codes can be used to book an alternative TUI Airways flight, TUI or First Choice accommodation or Marella cruise cabin. They can also be used to book a new package holiday on any TUI, First Choice, Marella Cruises or TUI River Cruises package holiday. Outstanding bills can also be settled using the code.Passengers who accept a credit refund will also benefit from a ""booking incentive"" of up to 20 per cent.This bonus will only apply for bookings that cost 20 per cent more than the original booking -if you book a flight or holiday that costs the same or less, you will receive no additional benefit.Passengers hoping to amend their booking online do not need to wait for their refund code, but can do so immediately here-with their 20 per cent booking incentive ready and waiting.

205,This life is hardly worth living;LETTERS TO THE EDITOR,"May 10, 2020 Sunday",International,The Sunday Times (London),440,440,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,,This life is hardly worth livingLETTERS TO THE EDITOR,"Matthew Syed writes wisely on the quality of life in lockdown (Comment, last week). I am classified as ""extremely vulnerable"": over 70, with rheumatoid arthritis, a suppressed immune system, a replacement hip and knees. My quality-adjusted life year (Qaly) score would be low. Yet I still have a life to live.Since my diagnosis and joint replacements, I have hiked in the Andes, tracked snow leopards in Siberia and been wild camping in Sudan. Watching the sun rise over the dunes, I have never felt more alive.Now I am being advised that I can sit by an open window to get some fresh air, and that I must be careful not to fall over when I go out to clap for carers. To continue this for an extended length of time would be the kiss of death. Preserving life at any cost would make that life not worth living.Sue Fleckney Grantham, Lincolnshire Sowing fear The argument that over-70s should be asked to endure prolonged lockdown restrictions to ""protect the NHS"" from having to treat them (News, last week) runs counter to the idea of a health service freely available to all. Has the same idea been considered for the obese? The real problem is that the government has invested next to nothing to prepare for end of lockdown, as its abysmal record on testing shows, and now it thinks it can simply cow the elderly by sowing fear.My generation will not be imprisoned when it has committed no crime. Eric Chalker (81) Hildenborough, Kent Talk to us Our government should realise that its electors of all ages are capable of adult conversation, and consult us on what we might wish for our lives: longer, lonelier and lacking human touch, or perhaps shorter and more satisfying.Annette Lawson, London W9 Patronising views You quote the behavioural scientist Andrew Oswald saying older people ""have no idea of the danger they are in"". I have news for him. We read papers, watch television and have a better perception of living this life than he thinks - and we find his view arrogant and offensive. Colin Little (72¾), Great Missenden, Buckinghamshire Difference a day makes Jen Bouchet (Letters, last week) is disgusted by the over-70s complaining of lockdown. I turned 70 the day her letter was published. What is so special about the ""0""? Why on May 3 did I become such a ""selfish"" risk to NHS staff, when I wasn't on May 2? There is no scientific reason for a healthy, slim, sensible 70-year-old to be considered a greater risk to the NHS than an overweight 55-year old - who attended a rugby match in March, after it was clear that Covid-19 was spreading round the UK, and bragged about shaking hands.

209,Key lockdown adviser says Dominic Cummings row 'fatally undermined' efforts to fight coronavirus,"May 25, 2020 Monday",International,standard.co.uk,212,212,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,April Roach,Key lockdown adviser says Dominic Cummings row 'fatally undermined' efforts to fight coronavirus,"A key Government adviser on the lockdown has said the ""debacle"" over Dominic Cummings alleged lockdown breach has ""fatally undermined"" efforts to fight coronavirus.Professor Stephen Reicher, a member of the Government's advisory group on behavioural science, is the latest figure to criticise the Government's response to reports that Mr Cummings broke the lockdown more than once. The Prime Minister's top aide is accused of breaking coronavirus lockdown rules by making a 250-mile journey to his family in Durham, when his wife had Covid-19 symptoms.                     Boris Johnson is under pressure to sack Mr Cummings or risk facing an even larger revolt within his own party as Tory MPs join Labour in condemning Mr Cummings' actions. Professor Reicher told Good Morning Britain: ""If you look at the research it shows the reason why people observed lockdown was not for themselves, it wasn't because they were personally at risk, they did it for the community, they did it because of a sense of 'we're all in this together'.""This really does concern me. It does make me feel like a lot of the work we have been doing hasn't been heard.""But at the same time as long we can do that work and as long as the public can hear it, we are doing something worthwhile at least.""",Newspaper; Web Publication

211,Eureka moment? Law firms report rush to patent ideas amid UK lockdown;Intellectual property lawyers report increased demand for services during Covid-19 crisisCoronavirus - latest updatesSee all our coronavirus coverage,"May 24, 2020 Sunday",International,The Guardian (London),830,830,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,Esther Addley,Eureka moment? Law firms report rush to patent ideas amid UK lockdownIntellectual property lawyers report increased demand for services during Covid-19 crisisCoronavirus - latest updatesSee all our coronavirus coverage,"A week before lockdown was imposed in March, Dane Whitehurst and his wife put the finishing touches to a room at their home in Kent that they hoped would be a chillout space for them and their three-year-old daughter. With normal working life abruptly halted, however, the room was urgently filled with desks and technical equipment, and any plans for relaxation were put on hold. From this temporary prototyping facility, looking out on to his garden, product designer Whitehurst began thinking about what life would be like in a post-coronavirus world.As creative director at a firm called Burgopak, Whitehurst works with a small team of colleagues developing ""innovative packaging"" for a range of products including bank cards, drinks and small electronics. Now his thoughts turned to how, in a hygiene-obsessed future, people would increasingly reject cash in favour of cards - stored, potentially, in an inventive new style of wallet.""It's [an idea] that we have had tucked away in the back of our minds for some time, but we've never had the time to fully explore it,"" he says. ""The time and space now has given us the opportunity to do that. You know how you get those eureka moments where all of a sudden the pieces slot together? I think the way we have been working has created the environment where that can happen.""Whitehurst has now applied to patent the ""magic wallet"", part of what some intellectual property lawyers have reported is a rush of new applications since the lockdown period began. ""We've certainly seen a lot of people coming to us with Covid-related innovation that they want to protect,"" says Mark Richardson, a partner and patent attorney at Keltie LLP, the law firm working with Burgopak. ""We've had people looking at decontamination systems, PPE, there has certainly been an uptick in that area.""Christopher Hamer, a partner at intellectual property specialists Mathys and Squire, agrees: ""In terms of the volume of new work [since the crisis began], it was a striking amount, and I know other firms have seen this as well.""A lot of it has been people coming and saying, 'we have talked about this in the past and I would like to progress it.' They are looking at their long-term future and trying to understand where they are going to be when things go back to normal.""Although precise figures will not be available until next year, according to a spokeswoman for the Intellectual Property Office where British applications are filed, ""early indicators suggest that input this year is up on the January to April period last year"".While some of the new applications directly address virus-related problems, others may have arisen from their creators processing a backlog of admin. By contrast, in some sectors such as pharmaceuticals, notes Tim Belcher, managing associate at law firm EIP, innovation has slowed due to laboratories having closed.But with the option of patenting ruled out the instant an idea has been discussed with anyone, Belcher says, the impetus to protect a good idea, even under lockdown, is clear. ""They need to come to us before they have spoken to possible manufacturers, before they have discussed it with their friend on a Zoom call.""Another innovator who has done that is Atif Syed, CEO and founder of a firm called Wootzano. From a unit in Sedgefield, county Durham, the small company has developed what it describes as ""electronic skin"", a highly stretchable polymer that Syed says can detect sensations ""the way you and I would, understanding touch, pressure, temperature, humidity"".While it could have many applications, the lockdown has underlined its potential use for robots picking soft fruit, where packing facilities faced with post-coronavirus labour shortages are increasingly looking at automation. The firm has been working on the skin for some time, but the crisis has driven the response from potential customers.""Whenever situations like this happen, there will always be new applications [for the product],"" says Syed.One innovation with a very clear potential benefit has been developed at Imperial College, London, where a team of product designers and behavioural scientists have come up with a new product to encourage handwashing in developing countries.""Everyone in the world knows about hand-washing, pretty much,"" says project leader Weston Baxter, but research by the team in Tanzania showed that bars of soap were viewed by many as items for laundry and dish-washing, not for washing their hands after using the toilet.In response, they developed a cheap and easily produced soap ""tab"" and dispenser system which, trials in the country show, dramatically increased rates of hand-washing.In a time of immense new challenges, Baxter says, the opportunities for new ideas are enormous. ""Whenever there is a lot of friction like this, it means there is a lot of opportunity for innovation. There has been a lot of very fast trial and error, certainly faster than we have seen in a normal time."" ",Newspaper
212,The big problem with banking;Challengers have struggled to scale the fortresses of the big four. Could the pandemic offer a fresh chance to break through?,"May 16, 2020 Saturday",International,thetimes.co.uk,1335,1335,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,Emma Dunkley,The big problem with bankingChallengers have struggled to scale the fortresses of the big four. Could the pandemic offer a fresh chance to break through?,"Anne Boden spent long nights coding at Standard Chartered in the 1980s. The work was unglamorous but it paid off: after decades spent in the backwaters of finance, she had the technological nous to create her own digital bank, Starling, in 2014.The moment seemed opportune, as the competition watchdog was gearing up for an investigation into the high street banks' domination of the market, and regulators had made it easier to gain a banking licence by dropping the need to raise all the capital required up-front and have the systems built.""I thought that the big banks had become very inward-looking and weren't using the best technology or really thinking about customers, so I decided to start a new bank,"" said Boden, 60. ""I founded Starling to take on the big banks.""Yet clawing customers away from the big four - HSBC, Lloyds, NatWest/Royal Bank of Scotland and Barclays - as well as the No 5, Santander, is far from straightforward, as Boden has discovered.The big four's market share has barely budged in decades. Just over 20 years ago, they had 68% of personal current accounts and 83% of small business accounts. Today, it is about 66% and 80%.Starling has just 1.6% of the 77 million personal current accounts and 2.5% of business accounts. Other challenger banks are in a similar position. Monzo, launched a year after Starling, has 5.45% of the current account market.Monzo, co-founded by chief executive Tom Blomfield, 34, is drumming up cash from investors at a discount of nearly 40% compared with its last fundraising. According to the Financial Times, the latest round could value the bank at about £1.25bn, down from £2bn last June.""Before Covid-19, the digital banks were starting to see significant customer growth, but from a competition perspective the power dynamics haven't changed much over the years,"" said Anthony Thompson, head of Glenburn Advisory.Specialist lenders such as Aldermore, OneSavings, Shawbrook and Secure Trust sought to capitalise on gaps in the market rather than compete with the big names head on. Metro Bank, which has stumbled since an accounting error last year, set out to emphasise customer service. TSB was formed as a result of the global financial crisis, while Virgin Money snapped up the remnants of Northern Rock.Although they are growing in number, the upstarts are all dwarfed by their high street counterparts. Many in the industry doubt that they will ever win meaningful market share and break the oligopoly.The need for banks that can provide swift lending has never been more urgent, with businesses scrambling for cash to survive the pandemic. The market leaders were immediately accredited to hand out emergency loans. This meant customers of newer banks could not obtain loans quickly. Access to cheap funding and higher capital requirements are a problem for new banks, too.""Small and medium business banking competition is still unacceptably weak,"" said Lord (Andrew) Tyrie, chairman of the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA). ""The speed and strength of the recovery will, among other things, depend on the extent to which small and challenger businesses can obtain access to a variety of sources of finance. Getting more competition into banking will be an even more important part of the economic reconstruction after Covid-19.""Efforts to stoke competition have floundered. Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) - recently rebranded NatWest - was meant to create a business-focused bank under the old Williams & Glyn name, as a condition of its £46bn bailout in the financial crisis. It failed, and has set up a £775m fund to boost competition instead.The pot of money, managed by Banking Competition Remedies (BCR), has not been dished out wisely. Metro and Nationwide had to hand back £50m each after they failed to fulfil growth strategies. Analysts are not convinced by a plan to redistribute that £100m in piecemeal grants. ""Overall, those small amounts will have little impact on competition,"" said Gary Greenwood of Shore Capital. ""The likelihood of digital start-ups taking huge swaths of market share is low.""Lord (Godfrey) Cromwell, head of BCR, said the process had been accelerated, ""given the pressing need"" for challengers to support small businesses.How have the big four maintained their stranglehold so effectively? It is a simple fact that few people move bank accounts. The Current Account Switch Service was launched in 2013 to handle moves in seven working days, yet in March only 113,037 were switched - fewer than 0.2% of current accounts.""People are losing a lot of money by not switching - they are scared to lose what they have, so they procrastinate,"" said Ivo Vlaev, professor of behavioural science at Warwick Business School. ""People are defeated by the complexity of overdraft charges. The hassle factor looms large in our minds.""Rock-bottom interest rates of 0.1% have made it tough to compete on price. Goldman Sachs trumped the field with a rate of 1.5% when it launched its digital savings account, Marcus, in 2018. It has amassed more than 500,000 customers and £17bn in savings, but has cut its rate several times and now pays 1.05%.Regulation, capital requirements and taxes hit small and medium-sized banks harder than big rivals, stifling growth. Ring-fencing rules, which require banks to separate deposits from riskier investment banking once they reach £25bn in deposits, are another deterrent.Numerous attempts to create competition have stumbled. The last measure by the CMA - so-called ""open banking"" - tasked banks with sharing customer data from 2018. It was viewed as a damp squib.Upstarts have come unstuck as they have tried to expand. Egg, the pioneering online bank launched by Prudential in 1998, focused on customer service. ""It made the traditional players step up, shape up and pull their socks up in terms of how they dealt with their customers,"" said Emma Byrne, who was a director at Egg. However, it grew too quickly and Yorkshire Building Society eventually took over its home loans and savings.It was a similar tale for building societies that took on too much risk. Those that became banks before the 2008 financial crisis, such as Halifax, Abbey National and Alliance & Leicester, rivalled the big lenders by offering higher interest rates plus lower charges on overdrafts. ""This did not appear to come at the expense of customer service,"" said the 2011 Vickers report on banking. They dominated mortgages, controlling half the market by number of loans.However, the demutualised building societies crumbled during the financial crisis. Santander bought Abbey National plus part of Bradford & Bingley, and Alliance & Leicester. Competition rules were waived to allow Lloyds TSB to buy HBOS (Halifax Bank of Scotland).""The entire financial system was under severe strain, the likes of which we hadn't seen for decades,"" said Lord (Alistair) Darling, chancellor at the time of the crisis. Sir Tom McKillop, who was chairman of RBS, then the biggest bank in the world, even phoned Darling on October 7, 2008, to say the bank had less than three hours' money left. For Darling, financial stability trumped competition.In the wake of the crisis, Lloyds and RBS were required to divest parts of their businesses to curb market share. Lloyds managed to split off TSB; RBS's attempt to form Williams & Glyn failed, at a cost of more than £2.5bn to taxpayers. RBS's foray into digital banking, called Bó, has also failed - it closed this month.Even if the RBS competition fund does not change market share, the cash will help boost digital banks such as Starling. Fintech start-ups may be small but they have forced the big banks to sharpen up.Boden is optimistic, despite the challenges. Starling is opening about 1,800 business accounts a day during the lockdown. It has approved £273m in bounce back loans and has teamed up with peer-to-peer site Funding Circle to lend £300m under the coronavirus business interruption loan scheme. They may be small steps, but they provide hope.",Web Publication

In a suburb in Stevenage, Hertfordshire, a young man disguised as a bush shuffles down the street, using front gardens as camouflage to avoid the police. ""What's our neighbour doing?"" says the narrator. ""Reaching new extremes in how to sneak out!"" The clip, which has garnered 3.3m views on the sharing site TikTok, taps into a welling sentiment among young people: a desire to break the lockdown.In the parks and on the street corners of Britain's cities, the young are rebelling against restrictions designed to tackle a disease that has left most of them unscathed, but is damaging their mental wellbeing and life prospects.According to a study by University College London (UCL), they are easily the least compliant age group when it comes to the lockdown, with about half of those aged between 18 and 29 admitting to breaking the rules. The survey of 85,000 found large majorities of middle-aged and elderly people complying.This generation gap, in part, reflects the reality of the disease: a tiny minority of youngsters who contract the coronavirus die from it. In the first week of May, 10 people in their twenties died of it, compared with 550 in their sixties.Yet the young are faring worse during the lockdown, reporting the strongest feelings of loneliness, anxiety and suicide. UCL found that almost 30% of young people have thought about death recently and that the young had lower life satisfaction than any other age group.Daisy Fancourt, who leads the research, has told Public Health England and the government about the findings: ""We have made them aware of the disproportionate impact that lockdown is having on younger people.""For many adults, the lockdown has been a surprisingly tranquil experience. But for people in their peak social years it has heralded a collective Fomo [""fear of missing out""] and a sense of anxiety and loss about a time they had expected to spend on formative experiences. Added to that is the tyranny that stalks every generation of young people: boredom.As the government announces the next phase of lockdown today, it faces a question: could discontent curdle into mutiny? Andrew Oswald, a behavioural scientist at Warwick University, is among those calling for the state to head off mass non-compliance by introducing a ""staged exit"" from the lockdown in which those in their twenties are released straight away, followed by those in their thirties.""We have to think about the terrible plight of these young people,"" he said. ""[They] should be released almost immediately. It's important to understand they're almost completely safe.""He added that the disproportionate financial effect of Covid-19 on the young made the case for relaxing the rules even more urgent: ""A lot of the old are in a fairly secure position even if we're all fed up with not being able to go to the beach, but the young, I would have thought, have very largely run out of all money and their life prospects have suddenly worsened dramatically.""Young people have the lowest confidence in the government of any group. According to the UCL study, their trust in Boris Johnson has risen marginally under the lockdown, but less than it has for other age groups.Dylan Welsh, 22, a student at Strathclyde University in Glasgow, has been self-isolating in his flat for eight weeks. He reported seeing people on Instagram flouting the lockdown: ""It infuriates me but I'm in an awkward position to be, like: are you properly social distancing?"" Sonali Gidwani, 23, a technology consultant in London, said she knew one person who had contracted Covid-19 after ""sleeping around"" during the lockdown. ""It's very frustrating and shows how little certain people of our age care,"" she said.Meanwhile, the authorities have clamped down on house parties, barbecues in parks and large gatherings. In Stockton, Co Durham, police last week secured a closure order for a flat that held a lockdown party featuring a ""constant flow of visitors by car, taxi, bicycle, moped and on foot"".On the Wirral, the council has drawn up a list of hotspots where young people are gathering illicitly. Last week it said that its detached youth team - an arm of social services - had been redeployed to round up errant teenagers and ""educate them"" on social distancing.Some councils and youth charities say disadvantaged youngsters are the most likely to flout rules, with a lack of adult supervision or entertainment at home. They are also the least likely to have gardens or green spaces in which to relax or exercise.Sam Rowe, founder of the Academy of Hard Knocks, which aims to cut youth crime in east London through martial arts, said: ""A lot of them haven't got the internet or the gadgets and gizmos that rich kids have … They say, 'I don't know what to do. I can't do this, can't do that, can't go out.' They're stuck indoors.""A lot of them are so fed up with the lockdown that they're breaking it. They're bored and frustrated.""Oswald agreed, saying the young being the first to break the lockdown ""is an easy prediction to make"".Editorial, page 18 The bushman video has been watched 3.3 million times",Newspaper
214,Children's mental health will suffer irreparably if schools don't reopen soon;An educational psychologist says missing out on everyday emotional support networks is storing up long-term problemsCoronavirus - latest updatesSee all our coronavirus coverage,"June 20, 2020 Saturday",International,The Guardian (London),812,812,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,Gavin Morgan,Children's mental health will suffer irreparably if schools don't reopen soonAn educational psychologist says missing out on everyday emotional support networks is storing up long-term problemsCoronavirus - latest updatesSee all our coronavirus coverage,"Schools give much more to our children than merely opportunities to learn. They also promote the development of a child's social emotional and mental health needs. The longer children are not attending schools, the greater problems we are storing for them and the education system in the months and years ahead. Covid-19 is not an equal disease.The most vulnerable children are being affected the most from missing school. For many youngsters, school is the most stable and secure part of their lives. For some, the attachments they build with teachers and peers are incredibly important for their mental health and wellbeing.We know that a failure to positively support psychological wellbeing has longer-term negative implications and this will be amplified by a continued lack of access to schools. We also know that school attachment and belonging are linked to later educational attainment; we will be managing the damaging effects of the pandemic in child development for many years to come.Evidence from previous pandemic studies show that children isolated or quarantined are more likely to develop acute stress disorder, attachment disorder and grief. In studies from across the world,            30% of children met the clinical criteria for post-traumatic stress disorder. Time is important - the longer this continues, the more profound the difficulties will be; more children will be affected and the greater the cost and challenge will be to overcome them. The risk to vulnerable children's welfare has increased significantly as a result of school closures. The risk of harm and abuse in the home is likely to be higher due to isolation and financial stress.The government and DfE should have been planning for schools to reopen even as they were being closedMany children have been denied access to key figures in their lives for the past three months and there is a real risk this could continue into the autumn. We are storing up issues that will need to be addressed when schools fully reopen. The sooner children return to school the fewer negative effects there will be.  Teachers are already familiar with the six-week dip that occurs in child development over the summer break - amplify this to six months or more and the problems are considerable.A sustained period away from school will reinforce inequalities between children, for instance a growing digital divide with  some able to access remote learning with effective IT and good broadband, which others can't. However, remote learning can never replace the need for human contact and interaction that all children need in order to develop healthily.Although many children have coped well so far without access to school, the longer they are not attending, the greater the risk of adverse effects. As time goes on, more children are likely to experience negative impacts to their wellbeing and mental health. Months away from school will mean that emerging developmental problems are missed by educational psychologists, opportunities for early intervention will be lost, resulting in greater damage to children that will require longer and more costly interventions.Children need opportunities to play and interact with their friends - they learn so much in terms of social development from these experiences. The most vulnerable will also be negatively affected by poor housing, poverty, lack of outside space and opportunities for play and exercise, crucial for positive mental health and wider development.As psychologists, we know the value of co-construction - of working with others to help them to become involved in developing solutions. The government and Department for Education should have been planning for schools to reopen even as they were being closed; and should have been working with teachers, parents, professional bodies and local authorities to develop trust, open communication and a shared goal. A lack of clear direction from the government has led to a lack of clarity and understanding. An opportunity has been missed and parents are fearful and teachers mistrustful.Children need to be in schools. The longer-term effects of dealing with the consequences of closures will have an impact on educational psychologists and other educational professionals in services that have been affected by a decade of austerity. There will need to be more psychology and psychologists in our schools and communities to help manage the consequences of closures. Many children are likely to need emotional support developed by educational psychologists and teachers. Supporting the development of a whole cohort of children affected by not being in school will be a challenge requiring considerable resources and planning.•Dr Gavin Morgan is an educational psychologist at University College London.

216,"Coronavirus: easing several lockdown rules at once could boost virus, say UK scientists;Sage advisers warn of risks of halving 2-metre rule while reopening venues in England Coronavirus - latest updatesSee all our coronavirus coverage","June 23, 2020 Tuesday",International,The Guardian (London),770,770,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,Haroon Siddique,"Coronavirus: easing several lockdown rules at once could boost virus, say UK scientistsSage advisers warn of risks of halving 2-metre rule while reopening venues in England Coronavirus - latest updatesSee all our coronavirus coverage","The easing of multiple lockdown measures in England at once risks Covid-19 gaining a fresh foothold, scientists advising the government have warned.They raised concerns over the halving of the 2-metre physical distancing rule at the same time as reopening venues, saying the country was currently experiencing up to 4,300 Covid-19 infections a day and had no effective digital track-and-trace system, while highlighting research that showed transmission of the virus was more likely to happen indoors.On Monday, it was announced that millions of people with underlying health issues           would be permitted to leave their homes and mix with groups from 6 July, for the first time in three months.On Tuesday Boris Johnson gave venues from museums to pubs to hairdressers the green light to reopen from 4 July, halved physical distancing           from 2 metres to 1 metre and said two households could meet up indoors, both also from 4 July.Acknowledging the relief many would feel - the Daily Express headline on Tuesday was ""Freedom pass for millions"" - Johnson called it the end of a ""long national hibernation"". However, scientists made clear that it came with risk.Prof John Edmunds, an epidemiologist at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, who sits on the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), said: ""The social distancing rules that have been in place since March have had two effects: first, the number of contacts that we make has been drastically reduced; and second the nature of these contacts has also become safer, as we seldom meet inside and we have been maintaining 2 metres of distance wherever possible.""Relaxing the 2-metre rule at the same time as opening bars and restaurants does run the risk of allowing the epidemic to start to regain a foothold. These changes will have to be very carefully monitored and the NHS track-and-trace system will have to be working properly to help keep us safe.""Prof Susan Michie, a psychologist on a subgroup of Sage, cited research suggesting 97% of super-spreading events, with five or more transmissions, have taken place indoors.She said that while the government was entitled to make a political decision - as Downing Street has indicated it has - it was important to be fully transparent, so the public could fully understand the risks and see whose advice it was relying on.""The key thing is that we don't have a [digital] test, trace, isolate system in place,"" said Michie, who is also a member of            Independent Sage. ""And I think that's the reason that the World Health Organization said last week that they thought            the UK should not lift any more restrictions. It's why other countries have 1 metre because they have other precautions and other systems in place that we don't have.She pointed to the current high transmission rate and added: ""Hospitalisations are not coming down dramatically and the fact that we've just had opening of non-essential shops and a range of other things, I think, not the best time to reduce it [the 2-metre rule].""Office for National Statistics (ONS) figures, published on Tuesday, showed that the latest weekly number of deaths from Covid-19 in England and Wales was 1,114, the lowest since 27 March, shortly after the imposition of the full lockdown on            23 March. On Monday, the official tally of UK deaths from Covid-19 was 15, the lowest number since 15 March.The latest ONS infection statistics show that approximately one in 1,700 people in a community setting in England (not in a hospital, care home or similar) had Covid-19 at any given time between 31 May and 13 June. This compares with one in 400 between 3 May and 16 May.But there have been concerns that the R value, showing the transmission rate, has been rising and is close to - or even above (different studies vary) - 1 in certain regions, which could lead to an exponential increase in cases.Rowland Kao, professor of veterinary epidemiology and data science at the University of Edinburgh and not affiliated to Sage, said: ""If the current R - bearing in mind there is a lag - is about 1, and the pre-lockdown R was around 3 to 4, then the difference, of about 2 to 3, is made up by things that we aren't doing that we were doing before (at least so long as the number of people who are immune is relatively few).""As we move through the gears of releasing lockdown we will 'recover' some of those missing events. The important thing is that we do so in a way that the change isn't too sudden. Of course things like face masks will likely help to keep it down - but we don't yet know how much.""",Newspaper

219,"Sir Patrick Vallance warns new coronavirus cases could start to rise again because R rate is 'potentially quite close to one', as Britain today announced 351 more deaths taking official number of victims to 36,393","May 22, 2020 Friday",International,MailOnline,2618,2618,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,Connor Boyd Health Reporter For MailonlineStephen Matthews Health Editor For Mailonline,"Sir Patrick Vallance warns new coronavirus cases could start to rise again because R rate is 'potentially quite close to one', as Britain today announced 351 more deaths taking official number of victims to 36,393","•Today's death toll is marginally lower than 363 recorded yesterday, the lowest Thursday figure since March 26•Experts sitting on Number 10's SAGE panel today revealed crucial R-value was teetering on brink of spiralling•Reproduction value - average number of people a patient infects has stayed between 0.7 and 1 for two weeks                     Britiain's chief scientific adviser has warned that the coronavirus's reproduction rate in the UK is 'potentially quite close to one', meaning that the number of new cases could start to rise again if it rises further.The R rate denotes the number of other people an infected patient will pass the sickness on to and it must stay at 1 or below or Britain will face another crisis. Sir Patrick Vallance said at today's Downing Street briefing: 'We're currently at an R across the UK of between 0.7 and 1. Below 1 in every area of the UK, we think, but potentially quite close to one.'So the epidemic is either flat or declining at the moment in the UK and in most areas it's declining.' Britain today announced 351 more coronavirus deaths, taking the official number of victims to 36,393. This is the second week in a row the R rate has officially been announced as between 0.7 and 1, meaning every 10 patients infect between seven and 10 others. However, the way the R is calculated means it is out of date, and the latest calculation is based on data from around three weeks ago - before the lockdown loosened. The R is calculated by working out how fast the virus spreads by comparing data including hospital admissions, the number of patients in intensive care, death statistics and surveys to find out how many people members of the public are coming into contact with. The new number does not factor in the slight relaxation of Britain's lockdown measures, announced by Prime Minister Boris Johnson on May 13. Mr Johnson has said ministers would reimpose controls if the rate of transmission of the virus started to pick up again. London is thought to be leading the way in terms of its R value, with experts from Public Health England and Cambridge University predicting it could be as low as 0.4 in the capital. But the nationwide reproduction number is being skewed upwards due to outbreaks in care homes and in Northern towns. It has prompted calls for regional easing of lockdown, with London leading the way. The capital was formerly the UK's coronavirus epicentre and at least two million people are thought to have been infected there, according to estimates. But experts say around 17 per cent of Londoners have now had the disease already and have built up immunity, which makes it harder for the virus to spread. Today's death toll - which takes into account all settings - is the lowest recorded on a Friday for eight weeks, since 284 on March 27. It is marginally lower than the 363 recorded yesterday. Fewer than half of the deaths (172) were in hospitals, with the rest of the fatalities registered in care homes and the wider community. The numbers only take into account victims who tested positive for the disease.Department of Health figures released this afternoon also showed that 3,287 more Britons had tested positive for the disease, after data released yesterday showed the UK had surpassed 250,000 confirmed cases - but the true size of the outbreak is estimated to have seen around 5million people infected. Home Secretary Priti Patel used today's Downing Street briefing to announce that, from June 8, anyone arriving in the UK from abroad must self-isolate for 14 days or face a fine of up to £1,000. She said this would reduce the risk of new cases from overseas triggering more outbreaks in Britain. In other developments to Britain's coronavirus crisis today:•A Nobel Prize-winning scientist tore into Boris Johnson's lack of political leadership over coronavirus that has left the UK on the 'back foot' and 'firefighting through successive crises';•Thousands of lives could have been saved from Covid-19 if Britain's lockdown was imposed just one week earlier, a government scientific adviser claimed;•JD Wetherspoon revealed its £11million masterplan to reopen its 875 pubs as soon as the Government gives them the nod in July;•So-called coronavirus 'immunity certificates' that could allow Brits to return to work have come a step closer after ministers announced mass antibody tests are being deployed;•Australia is pushing to be the first country exempted from the UK's 14-day coronavirus quarantine - as arrivals face 'spot checks' on homes and £1,000 fines for breaking the rules.                     WHAT IS THE R, AND HOW DOES THE GOVERNMENT ESTIMATE IT?                    Every infectious disease is given a reproduction number, which is known as R0 - pronounced 'R nought' - or simply R.It is a value that represents how many people one sick person will, on average, infect if the virus is reproducing in its ideal conditions.The value has been estimated by the Government's Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (SAGE).They assess data from hospitalisations, intensive care demand, deaths and the number of social contacts people have.Experts use multiple sources to get this information, including NHS hospital admissions, Office for National Statistics and CQC death figures and behavioural contact surveys. Using mathematical modelling, they are able to calculate the virus' spread. But a lag in the time it takes for coronavirus patients to fall unwell and die mean the R modelling is always roughly three weeks behind. Most epidemiologists - scientists who track disease outbreaks - believe the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which causes COVID-19, has an R value of around 3.But some experts analysing outbreaks across the world have estimated it could be closer to the 6.6 mark.As an outbreak goes on, the R0 may be referred to more accurately as Re or just R, as other factors come into play to influence how well it is able to spread. Estimates of the COVID-19 R vary because the true size of the pandemic remains a mystery, and how fast the virus spreads depends on the environment. As an outbreak progress the R may simply be referred to as R, which means the effective rate of infection - the nought works on the premise that nobody in the population is protected, which becomes outdated as more people recover. SAGE scientists have advised splitting classes in half and having them attend schools on alternate weeks could slash the effect on the coronavirus 'R' number.Evidence considered by the Scientific Advisory Group on Emergencies (SAGE) suggests the impact on the spread of the disease be a fraction would be dramatically smaller if pupils come back part time.A raft of documents released this afternoon also suggest that children are less likely to be infected and infectious than adults.Many of the concerns about schools returning appear to be over the knock-on impact on social distancing, with more mixing of families and parents returning to work.An assessment of various models of the impact of changes on the R rate shows the impact, on a scale of zero to one, would be 0.24 if classes were split and attended alternate weeks.If half the class went in in the morning and half in the afternoon that would rise to 0.4. The maximum impact of one would be if schools came back completely.A document from a behavioural insight meeting on May 1 said: 'Although not initially one of the options proposed by DfE, options 7b (classes split in two, with children attending on alternate weeks) emerged from the joint discussions as having particular potential merit for further consideration.'The findings will likely add to arguments with unions over whether it is safe for children to return, and if it can be achieved without triggering another flare up of the virus.The files emerged as a SAGE source claimed Government plans to reopen primary schools are grounded in welfare concerns rather than evidence younger pupils are less vulnerable.In the first phase of his back-to-school blueprint, Boris Johnson wants children in England in reception, Year 1 and Year 6 to go back to class on June 1.However, the exact shape of the reopening is being left in the hands of headteachers.Teaching unions have been threatening to boycott the move over safety fears, while a slew of councils have said they will not fall into line. Nicola Sturgeon has said schools in Scotland will not reopen until August, after the usual summer holiday north of the border.According to the SAGE papers, evidence on how likely children are to transmit Covid-19 remains 'inconclusive'.Wider contextual issues - including whether families have black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) members - must be taken into account when assessing the impact of relaxing school closures on transmission.Teachers do not appear to be at a greater risk of catching Covid-19 than other professions - but there is still some risk.

The Sage papers suggest that younger teachers' attendance in schools could be prioritised in order to decrease the likelihood of infection for school staff in more vulnerable groups.The publication of the advice comes after education unions and council leaders called for the evidence underpinning the proposal to reopen schools in England to be released.'Evidence remains inconclusive on both the susceptibility and infectivity of children, but the balance of evidence suggests that both may be lower than in adults,' according to the scientific modelling.Meanwhile, it emerged today that hundreds of thousands of coronavirus tests sent to people's homes have been counted but never returned to labs, PHE's testing boss has suggested.Professor John Newton, director of health improvement at Public Health England, could only say today that 'more than half' of home tests had been completed.The Government claims that 719,000 tests have been delivered to people for them to complete the swabs themselves, but a significant chunk of these may never have been done. The posted tests form a huge section of the 3.2million tests the Department of Health claims to have carried out.And Health Secretary Matt Hancock would not have hit his lauded target of 100,000 tests in a day by May 1 if the department had not posted out 39,000 the day before. If up to half of the tests posted out to people had never been returned to a laboratory that could mean up to around 350,000 of them never completed the lab analysis - but they were counted anyway by the Government.Professor Newton, speaking in a grilling by MPs on Parliament's Science and Technology Committee this morning, said it had been the Department of Health's decision to count tests that had been posted rather than those completed. In the same tense meeting, Professor Newton and his colleague Professor Yvonne Doyle, medical director at PHE, said Britain abandoned mass testing in March because the country's outbreak was already too large.'Many hundreds of thousands' of people had the virus after half-term, they admitted, and contact tracing 'could not possibly' have prevented the current disaster. Home tests have been available since the end of April but Professor Newton said he didn't know how many people who ordered them were actually returning them to the labs.When asked what the return rate was, Professor Newton hesitated at length before saying: 'Certainly more than half.'Pressed again by Conservative MP Greg Clark, chair of the committee, Professor Newton added: 'I'm afraid I don't have that figure.'The fact that up to 50 per cent of the tests may not be getting sent back to labs for analysis suggests that the number of tests the Government is claiming to do each day could be wildly over-estimated.Professor Newton, defending PHE's involvement, said the Department of Health took the decision to count a test that had been posted.Labour MP Graham Stringer said what the definition of a test was and said: 'Clearly, posting a test is not a test.' Professor Newton replied: 'The way tests are counted [was] discussed with officials at the Department of Health and we were advised by the officials in the Department of Health on the appropriate method of counting the tests and that's what we did.'Greg Clark, the meeting's chair, cut in: 'They advised you, you didn't advise them?' 'No, they advised us, absolutely, yes,' Professor Newton said.Mr Stringer asked with a raised eyebrow: 'Do you think it's appropriate? Counting posted letters as opposed to real tests?'And Professor Newton replied: 'Well, I think the important thing is that they're only counted once.'The basis on which we were advised that the decision had been made was that the test should be counted at the point where the programme had control of what happened, and that was the point at which the tests were sent out and made available for testing.'The key thing is that a very large number of tests are now being conducted and, whichever way you count them, it's a large number of tests - it's a huge increase.' In the meeting the PHE bosses also admitted that Britain had to abandon its South Korea-esque approach to testing and tracing infections in March because the UK's outbreak was simply too large.South Korea has earned global acclaim for its policy of intensively testing and isolating everyone in the population suspected of having COVID-19.This means the cases there have been contained to relatively small areas and the number of them is extremely low (around 11,000 confirmed cases).Britain had wanted to follow the same strategy but, by the time officials realised the virus was spreading in the UK, it was already too late.Professor Doyle said today that 'mass contact tracing needed to cease in March'.She explained: 'It was a decision that was come to because of the sheer scale of cases in the UK which had been introduced by multiple introductions, particularly after half term, from European countries we now know had large amounts of prevalence themselves.'",Web Publication
220,Historical racism may be behind England's higher BAME Covid-19 rate;Calls grow for UK government to act as delayed report says ethnic minorites less likely to seek help or raise concernsCoronavirus - latest updatesSee all our coronavirus coverage,"June 16, 2020 Tuesday",International,The Guardian (London),653,653,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,Haroon Siddique and Jamie Grierson,Historical racism may be behind England's higher BAME Covid-19 rateCalls grow for UK government to act as delayed report says ethnic minorites less likely to seek help or raise concernsCoronavirus - latest updatesSee all our coronavirus coverage,"A delayed report into the reasons why black, Asian and minority ethnic people (BAME) are disproportionately contracting and dying from Covid-19 has increased pressure on the government to act immediately to address the problem.The Public Health England (PHE) review, based on stakeholder engagement with more than 4,000 people, says historical racism may make BAME individuals less likely to seek care when needed or, as NHS staff, to speak up when they have concerns about personal protective equipment (PPE) or increased risk.Dr Jennifer Dixon, the chief executive of the Health Foundation, said: ""Black and minority ethnic communities speak loudly in this report and say discrimination is among the fundamental causes of ill health. They should be listened to.""We have seen many commissions make recommendations on racial equality in the past. Now is the time for further concrete action, beginning with government.""PHE's work on disparities in the effects of Covid-19 on BAME communities has been dogged by controversy since it published its first report two weeks ago, which found that BAME Britons were up to            twice as likely as white Britons to die if they contracted coronavirus,            but it failed to examine why or propose solutions.Additionally, it was reportedly censored by the government before publication to remove any references to the impact of structural racism, and last week it emerged that there was an entirely separate 69-page document, which was            leaked to Sky News.This document, finally published on Tuesday, contains recommendations including the mandatory collection of ethnicity data at death certification, good representation of BAME staff at all levels in NHS and care services, and ""fully funded, sustained and meaningful approaches to tackling ethnic inequalities"".However, it still attracted criticism for being too vague. Dave Prentis, the general secretary of the Unison union, said: ""The government must act now. Words and promises to do something in the future won't cut it any longer.""The government's failure to release the PHE data and recommendations together was a huge mistake. It's caused further mistrust and damage to the black community at a time when people need reassurance, not dither, delay and excuses.""Kamlesh Khunti, a professor of primary care diabetes and vascular medicine at the University of Leicester, said: ""The report makes seven recommendations, many of which seem obvious, but does not give a huge amount of detail on how these can be implemented and over what timeframe.""The Royal College of Nursing said the report supported its calls to protect BAME staff through targeted risk assessments ""to avoid needless loss of life"".Criticism of the government for failing to take action to protect BAME people from the disproportionate risk posed by Covid-19 has come as tens of thousands of people in the UK have taken to the streets to            protest against racial injustice.It emerged on Tuesday that the government's scientific advisers had raised the prospect of protests or unrest due to racial inequality and economic hardship being exacerbated by the virus.In a paper published in late May on the Covid-19 risks from public protest in the event that lockdown is eased, the Sage/SPI-B security and policing sub-group cautioned: ""Inequality and grievance in the UK ought not to be seen in isolation. Although a sense of common purpose does not yet exist, there are some signs that it is emerging, for example, in comparisons of the differential impact on certain ethnic communities. This is already a cause célèbre for organisations such as Black Lives Matter, which has a global network.""Economic hardship and a sense of hopelessness among young people may also be channeled in ways reminiscent of protests in France, specifically emulating them.""

221,"Public put at risk by the spread of confusion;With Holyrood and Westminster split over lockdown, it's hard to know who we should listen to","May 10, 2020 Sunday",International,thetimes.co.uk,874,874,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,Magnus Linklater,"Public put at risk by the spread of confusionWith Holyrood and Westminster split over lockdown, it's hard to know who we should listen to","It has been a good lambing season. Warm weather, grass coming through strongly, little sign of the many diseases newborn lambs are prone to. I spent an evening with our local shepherd last week, watching him rounding up lost lambs and returning them to their mothers.It is a remarkable skill. To most of us one sheep looks much like another. Identifying the one ewe out of an entire flock which has become separated from its offspring, unsteady on its feet and bleating anxiously, is like finding a needle in a haystack. Rounding it up and staging a reunion is a lengthy task but immensely rewarding, as mother and child race towards each other.There has been one unintended consequence of the lockdown. Along two of the lambing fields close to the River Tay runs a public road, and local residents who once went to work during the week now use it to walk their dogs.If there is one thing that spooks sheep it is bounding dogs - they see them, presumably, as a throwback to wolves, and they scatter, losing their lambs in the process. It is known in the trade as ""mis-mothering"", and it takes hours to repair.The walkers fall into two schools: those who are deeply apologetic and promise to keep their dogs well away so long as lambing continues; and those who assert their rights. This, they say, is a public right of way, and this their permitted period of time out in the open.This collision of attitudes goes wider than the sheep flocks of Perthshire. It runs through the population as a whole, and it will determine whether Boris Johnson's announcement yesterday that the rules which have so far kept us indoors are to be relaxed will be accepted or exploited. Already there are signs that people are beginning to push the boundaries, gathering in groups, sunbathing in the parks, swimming in rivers and ponds, regardless of social distancing.The young, in particular, are turning mutinous after six weeks of lockdown. They believe they have suffered more than most because they have lost jobs or an early start to their careers; many of them face serious financial hardship; others are simply going stir crazy. They are also least susceptible to the disease. Some experts believe they should be the first to be allowed out.Andrew Oswald, a behavioural scientist at Warwick University, argues that people in their twenties and then thirties should be released almost immediately. ""It's important to understand they're almost completely safe,"" he suggests. Mr Johnson rejects that approach, but he does want to offer them some hope of greater freedom. In Scotland, Nicola Sturgeon remains cautious.Which voice, then, do the people heed? The advice of a government that is relaxing the rules on outdoor exercise, on the workplace and on industries like construction; or the continuing rigidity north of the border? That depends ultimately on the character of the nation today, and its attitude to those in charge. Much has changed since that period, 75 years ago, when the war ended, and the people emerged from their long privation to celebrate freedom. I was struck by the image of the lights coming on again after the blackout, with curtains ripped open and searchlights playing on public buildings. Then there had been six years of absolute obedience in the face of a visible threat. Today the enemy is largely invisible and, after only six weeks, the rules are getting harder to enforce.In her speech last Friday night the Queen suggested that the character of the British people had not changed much since the war. ""When I look at our country today and see what we are willing to do to protect and support one another, I say with pride that we are still a nation those brave soldiers, sailors and airmen would recognise and admire,"" she said. She may be right, but of course the nation she was recalling did not always play by the rules of the game. Within a few short months of those mass celebrations on the streets of Britain's cities, they would turn against the leader who had brought them victory and vote in a socialist government.Mr Johnson may face the same scepticism. He seeks to persuade the people that they should obey a new set of rules that are not necessarily agreed by all countries and regions in the UK. He is doing so against mounting impatience, with business leaders urging a relaunch of the economy, small companies desperate to avoid closure, and a people whose obedience cannot necessarily be counted on. Like the dog-walkers, they have their rights, and those rights may be asserted.There is a wonderful sketch by our national treasure, Stanley Baxter (94 this month), in which he plays the Queen on a royal tour of Belfast. She meets a lady in the crowd (played of course by Baxter) who, when asked ""have you come far?"" proceeds to harangue her at length, to the Queen's mounting dismay. I suspect that Mr Johnson may encounter something similar as he seeks to rally the nation behind a continued, if slightly different, lockdown.His new message seeks to strike a delicate balance between restrictions that are being increasingly flouted, and the need to control a dangerous and highly infectious virus. Whether the citizens of the UK are in a mood to listen will determine the future course of the epidemic.",Newspaper; Web Publication
222,Job ad cuts macho words to flush out female recruits,"June 23, 2020 Tuesday",International,The Times (London),613,613,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,Greg Hurst,Job ad cuts macho words to flush out female recruits,"Are you a confident sewage champion who can see off the competition to land your dream job? If the answer is yes, you are probably a man.When Thames Water used a combination of the words ""confident"", ""competition"" and ""champion"" in a job posting, it found that an overwhelming number of applicants were male.This, the company concluded, was nothing to do with the responsibilities of the role advertised - including treating sludge and sampling effluent - but more to do with the language used in recruitment.Women, they found, were just as keen to work with sewage as men. However, when the advertisements were posted last year seeking maintenance staff for sewage plants, only 8 per cent of respondents were women.That, in turn, prompted some soul searching and a review of why women were apparently not interested. The utility company used an online tool to examine the phrasing of its adverts and found them peppered with words that would put off women. It found that the job had been inadvertently ""masculine coded"".The specification for the job, which pays up to £28,000 a year, was re-written to have a more neutral tone and included a few feminine-coded phrases, too.Instead of saying that the job was ""to ensure sewage is treated effectively and efficiently"" it spoke of ""an excellent opportunity to make a real impact on the delivery of wholesome water"".Whereas applicants were previously advised that they should have ""a background in an industrial or similar setting"", the new posting talked of joining ""a close-knit team with a family feel"". It said there was a mentor to offer support throughout training and beyond.The new wording emphasised the company's commitment to diversity and added ""we welcome people who want to learn and be team players"".When the new-look advertisements were circulated the results were dramatic. The proportion of women applicants rose to 46 per cent. The Thames Water research builds on studies in the US that revealed the gender imbalance of job advertisements.Iris Bohnet, a visiting professor at Harvard Business School and co-chairwoman of Harvard's behavioural insights group, is the author of What Works: Gender Equality by Design, which discusses how companies can fight gender bias.In the book, she cites the example of a school advertising for ""a committed teacher with exceptional pedagogical and interpersonal skills to work in a supportive environment.""The potential problem is that ""supportive"" and ""committed"" are associated with femininity, which may discourage men from applying. Among those hired at Thames Water was Rachael Trigg, 24, who is responsible for maintenance and repairs at Chieveley sewage works in Newbury, Berkshire.She said: ""I got made redundant, saw this on [employment website] CV Library and really liked the sound of it. It's general maintenance around the site, fixing any issues that arise.""She added: ""There might be certain things I can't do, like heavy lifting, but we're a team so we help each other out. Women are really missing out if they think a job like this isn't for them.""Pablo Stevens, manager of the site at Chieveley, said: ""The sex of someone is irrelevant. If they can get the job done, that's all that matters.""Not all such roles involve treating sewage. There are similar jobs that involve fixing leaking water pipes.The initiative was backed by a women's network at Thames Water, Britain's biggest water company, which supports women in engineering and other roles previously dominated by men.Lucia Farrance, a customer services manager who led the project to recruit more women into operational roles, said: ""To bring about real change, women need more seats at the table.""",Newspaper

In a paper to the Government's Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) on June 4, the EMG wrote: 'Given the uncertainties about transmission and dose-response it is not possible to say with certainty what a safe distance of separation is but best current evidence suggests that one metre carries between two and 10 times the risk of two metres of separation.'Countries that specify a separation distance below two metres generally mandate other mitigation measures, usually face masks or face coverings as a minimum.'Outdoor transmission remains low risk through aerosol and indirect contact routes, but face-to-face exposure should still be considered a potential risk for transmission via respiratory droplets'However we remain of the view that face-to-face transmission could be possible and the ability for wind to keep droplets airborne means that we recommend that people continue to observe a distance of two metres when face to face and avoid prolonged exposure to other people.'The World Health Organization (WHO) currently recommends a one-metre social distancig rule, which has been followed by several countries including France, Singapore and Denmark.                      Earlier this week, MPs revealed fears that tens of thousands of businesses could go bust if a two-metre rule remains in place. Business Secretary Alok Sharma claimed that businesses will want to take a look at the two-metre rule 'for economic reasons', while Chancellor Rishi Sunak also held a meeting with the 1922 committee of Tory backbenchers on Thursday calling for regulation to be scrapped in order to kickstart the economy.A snap YouGov poll taken on the same day revealed that 58 per cent of Britons want the two-metre rule to remain in place, with 24 per cent want it halved.The PM gave an indication on Friday that the two-metre rule could be relaxed soon today as figures showed the UK economy in freefall with a record 20.4 per cent decline in April.Scientists warned that bubbles should not be introduced in short termBy Joe Gammie, PA Government scientific advisers warned that social bubbles should not be introduced when social-distancing measures had just been lifted or in conjunction with easing other restrictions.The Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) said last month that bubbles could create 'significant unwanted effects' and should not be introduced in the short term.In a report of its meeting on May 14, published on Friday, Sage advised 'strong caution' to introducing social bubbling and said it could not be seen as a 'universal good'.But the Sage report said that while larger households social bubbling together posed a 'significant potential risk', bubbling may be 'appropriate in limited circumstances'.It added: 'Sage advised that social bubbles have the potential to create significant unwanted effects and advised against their introduction in the short term, when other distancing measures have only just been lifted or in conjunction with release of other measures.'Sage advised strong caution concerning the introduction of social bubbling - particularly in the short term, when other distancing measures have only just been lifted or in conjunction with release of other measures.'Sage has advised previously against making too many changes at once.'Sage concluded that bubbling may be appropriate in limited circumstances.'The report was published a day before adults living alone or single parents in England will be allowed to mix with one other household.The 'support bubbles' will allow the two households to interact as though they were one household, spending time together indoors, not having to follow the two-metre rule and would be allowed to stay overnight.Mr Johnson said: 'We are making this change to support those who are particularly lonely as a result of lockdown measures.'It is a targeted intervention to limit the most harmful effects of the current social restrictions.'It is emphatically not designed for people who don't qualify to start meeting inside other people's homes because that remains against the law.'Further reports to Sage, also published on Friday, warned that breaching support bubbles could lead to a 'significant risk of increasing transmission'.Two reports by the Scientific Pandemic Influenza Group on Modelling (SPI-M) dated May 6 and May 13 said that clear messaging was needed to make sure people understood what was allowed.It added: 'In order to be effective, no person can be a member of more than one bubble, all individuals in one household must belong to the same bubble, and the bubble must contain the same individuals for the foreseeable future.'Even small breaches of bubbles are likely to prevent their effect on slowing transmission and come with a significant risk of increasing transmission.'A report by the Independent Scientific Pandemic Influenza Group on Behaviours (SPI-B), dated May 14, it said bubbling should only be phased in starting on a small scale once epidemiological conditions were right.It added: ''Bubbles' or the creation of household connections should be approached with a high degree of caution and only phased in very gradually starting with the smallest size of connections.'",Web Publication
224,How coronavirus social 'bubbles' starting today will work -as SAGE concerns emerge;Some couples living in different homes will be able to visit and stay with each other for the first time in months from today as part of the Covid-19 social 'bubbles' plan,"June 13, 2020 Saturday",International,mirror.co.uk,1128,1128,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,"By, Matthew Dresch",How coronavirus social 'bubbles' starting today will work -as SAGE concerns emergeSome couples living in different homes will be able to visit and stay with each other for the first time in months from today as part of the Covid-19 social 'bubbles' plan,"Coronavirus social 'bubbles' will start today, enabling some people to visit other households for the first time in months.It comes after scientists advised against bubbles being introduced as they could create 'significant unwanted effects'.However, the Government decided that from today, people living alone in England can form bubbles with another household.Northern Ireland is adopting a similar relaxation of the regulations for people living alone.In a report of its meeting on May 14, published yesterday, the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies SAGE advised ""strong caution"" to introducing social bubbling and said it could not be seen as a ""universal good"".But the SAGE report said that while larger households social bubbling together posed a ""significant potential risk"", bubbling may be ""appropriate in limited circumstances"".                     How the social 'bubbles' will work                                        Who is covered by the new arrangements                   Adults living alone or single parents living with children under the age of 18.                     What will they be able to do that they could not before                   They can form a bubble with one other household which means they will effectively be treated as a single household for the purpose of the lockdown rules.That means they can visit each other indoors in their homes -staying overnight if they wish -and they will not have to observe the two-metre social-distancing rule.These bubbles are strictly exclusive -neither household can form a bubble with anyone else.                     Who might benefit                     Elderly people living alone could form a bubble with the household of an adult son or daughter enabling them to visit and even hug their grandchildren for the first time since lockdown.Single parents could pair up with their own parents allowing them to share childcare duties and reuniting grandparents and grandchildren.Couples who do not live together will be able to visit and to stay with each other.If one half of a couple shares a flat or house with one or more other people, they can see their partner as long they live alone -if their partner also shares a home they cannot see each other.And if several people share a flat or house and all have partners who live alone, only one will be able to see their partner, which could lead to some interesting conversations. This will affect large numbers of young people living in towns and cities.                     What about households where both grandparents are still living -can they now visit their children and grandchildren                   At this stage only if their son or daughter is the only adult in the other household in the bubble. And if the grandparents have two or more children who live alone, they will have to choose between them.Downing Street has acknowledged not everyone will benefit from the change although officials have hinted a further loosening of the rules if the coronavirus outbreak continues to decline.                     Can households form more than one bubble                   No. The arrangement must be exclusive with no switching of bubble partners.                     Will people have to formally register these bubble arrangements                   No, it will be taken on trust. No 10 says the public has shown ""great responsibility"" in following the social distancing rules so far.                     Is there any limit on the distance between households in a bubble                   Again no, although officials are suggesting people should try to ""stay local"" where possible.                     What about vulnerable people who are shielding due to their age or health problems                   At the moment, officials say it is too soon for them to be able to join support bubbles.                     What about parents who are separated but who currently share childcare with the children moving between the two households                   That will continue. If the parents are the only adult in the household they can form a bubble with another household -meaning the children could potentially be in two bubbles, one for each parent.                     What happens if someone in a bubble develops coronavirus symptoms                   All members of both households in the bubble must self-isolate for 14 days.                     Does this apply only to England                     A scheme in Northern Ireland has also been brought in from Saturday.

225,"NHS bosses fear 'backstage' behaviour of doctors and nurses is fuelling spread of virus;Healthcare Almost three months after start of lockdown, hospitals told to ensure medics follow social distancing rules","June 13, 2020 Saturday",International,The Daily Telegraph (London),2556,2556,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,Laura Donnelly; Katherine Rushton,"NHS bosses fear 'backstage' behaviour of doctors and nurses is fuelling spread of virusHealthcare Almost three months after start of lockdown, hospitals told to ensure medics follow social distancing rules","THE NHS medical director has ordered hospital staff to enforce social distancing rules amid concern that workers' ""backstage"" behaviour is fuelling the spread of Covid-19, prolonging the lockdown.Health chiefs have written to every hospital and GP practice, urging them to make changes to stop doctors and nurses ""congregating"", to reduce levels of transmission within clinical settings.From next week, all staff, patients and visitors to hospitals will be required to wear masks.The move has been prompted by concern that Britain remains stuck in lockdown because it has been unable to get a grip on outbreaks in hospitals and care homes - which continue to leak out into local communities and increase the risk of a second wave.While Britain recorded its first case of Covid-19 in late January, and entered a nationwide lockdown on March 23, an investigation by The Daily Telegraph reveals: It was not until May 18 that health chiefs issued guidance advising NHS staff how to ensure social distancing; More than one in 10 hospital deaths from Covid-19 involved those who were admitted without the virus, new evidence suggests; Concern from Government advisers that health workers who are adhering to social distancing rules on the ward, are behaving differently ""backstage"" with the disease being spread in coffee breaks and huddles; Documents showing the disastrous decision to stop routine testing and tracing followed advice from Public Health England that ""transmission chains in closed settings such as care facilities do not have the same implications as those in the community""; Research showing more than 40 per cent of front-line health workers at one major London hospital were infected by Covid-19 - more than twice the level at other large European centres; The failure to stem the crisis has prompted a letter from Prof Stephen Powis, the NHS England medical director, instructing NHS hospitals to take ""further action to tackle infections acquired in the NHS itself "". Hospitals are told to ""minimise"" close contacts between staff, with workers told to ""avoiding congregating at central work stations"" and asked to take staggered staff breaks.The letter, which was also signed by the NHS chief nurse and its operating officer, spells out the importance of ""all staff adhering to social distancing (two metres) wherever possible in non-clinical areas.""It follows growing concern that coronavirus is spreading within hospitals, because Britain failed to introduce basic measures - such as masks, routine staff testing and strict social distancing - which have helped to contain the pandemic in other parts of Europe.The infection of 100 staff at Weston General Hospital, Weston-super-Mare, Somerset, forced its closure to new patients for two and a half weeks.Today The Telegraph can reveal that it was not until May 18 that Public Health England's guidance on infection control was updated to include advice about how NHS trusts should ensure their staff followed social distancing protocols. This was a full week after the Government issued advice to other employers who were considering reopening their workplaces.The PHE guidance said all staff should adhere to social distancing wherever possible, particularly if not wearing a face mask or visor and when in non-clinical areas.It said that ward practice should be reviewed to minimise close contact between groups of staff for prolonged periods, and congregation at nurses stations.Previous advice merely said ""social distancing of two metres should be facilitated wherever this is possible"" without any reference to staff. One senior NHS manager said: ""The situation is ridiculous. It seems hard to believe, given that the whole country has been talking about social distancing for months, but it is only now that some NHS trusts are really thinking about basic measures like ensuring nurses aren't all hanging out together in an office.""""A lot of trusts have been really strict ensuring patients keep their distance from each other, but they don't seem to have put the same effort into limiting the spread of Covid-19 between staff.""""It wasn't until the Government issued the advice to employers that the penny seemed to drop.""Government advisers are worried about the R value - the average rate at which the virus spreads from those infected to their contacts.Lowering the R rate is key to lifting lockdown. A figure above 1 indicates that the virus is spreading, while figures below 1 show that it is in decline. Britain's rate remains stubbornly high, at between 0.7 and 0.9 in the UK, and between 0.8 to 1 in England.In particular, the Sage advisory group is concerned that hospitals are now a major source of ""reseeding"" of infection into communities.There is growing concern that the behaviour of health and care workers - often working in crowded, and stressful situations - is driving up the rates of infection.Members of Nervtag - the New and Emerging Threats Advisory Group, which advises Government - are concerned that health workers who observe social distancing rules in public are behaving differently ""backstage"".One said: ""There is a good bit of anecdotal evidence that the hospital staff are rigorous with infection control on Covid wards when they're doing Covidrelated work. But as soon as they come off the wards, you get stories of 10 doctors clustering round an X-ray viewer without any regard to social distancing or masks or anything like that.""People will sit round and they will have their coffee and - the language that some hospital staff used is that it's 'more like home than home'.""At a webinar late last month, senior officials expressed similar concerns.Dr Chris Moran, the deputy national strategic incident director for Covid-19, told fellow managers: ""I've witnessed and I'm sure you've all witnessed that actually healthcare workers are not necessarily been the best at managing social distancing.""We know when directly managing patients social distancing is impossible, that's what PPE is for to protect both sides of the equation,"" Dr Moran added.""But I think in the staff-only areas we could do quite a lot better in some places that I've visited.""Papers published by Sage yesterday show that at the peak of the crisis, transmission within hospitals was believed to account for up to 22 per cent of hospitalised patients, and up to 11 per cent of recent deaths.Last week, Sage members warned the Lords science and technology select committee that health and care staff were putting the rest of the country at risk of a second wave of infection. Prof John Edmunds said: ""These are not completely separated epidemics...They seep back out into the community, probably largely through healthcare workers or care home workers, who are picking up the virus themselves, unfortunately, bringing it home, and potentially infecting their family members and others.""Papers released by Sage suggest health officials failed to properly consider the risks of allowing the outbreak to spread in care homes.While care home deaths are expected to make up at least half of the deaths caused directly or indirectly by the crisis, a paper by PHE on when to abandon the policy of contact tracing states: ""Transmission chains in closed settings such as care facilities do not have the same implications as those chains in the community.""The discussions came ahead of the decision to abandon routine testing and tracing of Covid cases from March 13, leaving patterns of disease unchecked for more than two months. Research led by University College London Hospitals, which was co-authored by Prof Susan Michie, a Sage member, and has not yet been peer-reviewed, has shone a light on just how far the infection has spread amongst staff.The study found that 200 front-line health workers at University College London Hospitals (43.5 per cent) had been infected by early May.This was considerably higher than researchers expected, after larger studies of workers at hospitals in Barcelona and Birmingham found that just 11 per cent and 24 per cent respectively had been infected.An NHS spokesman said: ""Hospitals across the country have longstanding effective mechanisms for infection prevention and control and the NHS has regularly communicated the guidance, which is set by PHE, as well as supporting trusts with data and a checklist to share learning and help limit the spread of infection.""The Government has always been clear that social distancing is recommended for everyone.""Public Health England said the four UK Chief Medical Officers, alongside PHE and NHS England, jointly issued infection prevention control guidance for health and social care workers on April 24 that reinforced existing guidance for the whole of the UK that ""social distancing of two metres should be facilitated wherever this is possible"". The guidance did not suggest how this should be achieved.Duncan Selbie, the PHE chief executive, said the Sage report on care home transmission ""highlighted that spread in the community operates differently to spread in a care home, it does not say that transmission could not occur from a care home into the community.""Not safe Patients died after catching virus in hospital Amanda Strudwick Pilgrim Hospital, Lincs Cancer patient admitted with pneumonia The former nurse survived lung cancer last year, but was admitted to hospital in March when she contracted pneumonia. She later found out her cancer had returned. Ms Strudwick, 52, went on to contract Covid-19 from an elderly dementia patient on the same ward and died on Apr 11. ""I think that's the shocking part - that the one place where you believe she'll be the safest is the one place where she ends up catching it,"" said her son, Callum. Mr Strudwick said his mother, from Kirton, Lincs, befriended the dementia patient and helped her back into bed when she became disorientated. Her daughter, Nicole, added: ""Little did my mum know she would contract Covid-19 off this lady.""Richard Daniels Bedford Hospital, Beds Routine treatment for a urinary tract infection The 89-yearold greatgrandfather died on May 9 after contracting Covid-19 in hospital while having treatment for a UTI. His daughter, Jennifer Ridley, said he was otherwise in ""great health"" and had been working only a month before his death. Mr Daniels was known locally for his infrastructure projects, including a Tesco superstore in Baldock, Herts. ""Dad was a self-made man who started his career when he was just 14,"" said Ms Ridley. ""He did not deserve to die without his family around him. All we could do was send some of his favourite music and write letters to be read while he lay unconscious. It is heartbreaking we could not give him the send-off he so deserves.""Nasro Ade St George's Hospital, south London Routine kidney dialysis The 25-year old, who had kidney failure, died within 11 days of being diagnosed with Covid-19 and isolated on a ward. She had one kidney and was undergoing dialysis three days a week in hospital, which is believed to be how she contracted the virus. Her family had to say goodbye on a video call from her hospital bed as she struggled to stay awake, exhausted from battling the virus. Nasro's friend of 12 years, Isha Ceesay, said they were heartbroken not to have been able to hold their daughter's hand as she slipped away on April 17. ""The doctors and nurses suggested the family say their goodbyes because they were not sure she was going to make it - she was no longer responding to treatment,"" Isha said.Marita Edwards Royal Gwent Hospital in Newport, Wales Routine gallbladder operation The 80-yearold grandmother was admitted to hospital for a gallbladder operation on Feb 28, and became the first victim of hospital-acquired Covid-19 in the UK. The retired cleaner from Bulwark, Monmouthshire, was initially told she had pneumonia, but tested positive three weeks after arriving, and died the next day. Her son, Stuart Loud, said she was ""very fit"", played golf and had no underlying conditions. He said she would still be alive if she hadn't been admitted. ""We couldn't touch her, we couldn't hold hands, kiss her, hug her or anything else. We just had to watch her slip away."" The Aneurin Bevan University Health Board said its hospitals had strict infectioncontrol procedures.Disastrous consequences Outbreak that shut hospital 'may have started in staff quarters'The coronavirus outbreak at Weston General Hospital that forced its closure to new patients for two and a half weeks, shocked the community but came as little surprise to public health experts.At the time, infections were decreasing and the Government was preparing to ease lockdown measures.The outbreak is reportedly believed to have started in a staff accommodation block, although an investigation is ongoing.More than 100 staf - around six per cent - - tested positive. Of a smaller group who worked with Covid-19 patients, around 40 per cent of staff tested positive.The hospital was shut after five patients on a non-Covid ward tested positive.A ""senior employee"" whistleblower, told Bristol Live that a system introduced in mid-April, which divided the hospital into two layers, one floor for coronavirus patients and one for non-virus patients, may have had disastrous consequences.""Management decided to split the junior doctors into two groups,"" he said. ""One would cover the first floor and the other group the second floor. The problem was they rotated the teams every week.""The hospital began a phased reopening on Wednesday. A spokesman for University Hospitals Bristol and Weston NHS Foundation Trust said the outbreak's cause was under investigation. Victoria WardTesting times How Britain's pandemic response compared with the best in EuropeBritain's record on testing is now seen as one of the key reasons why the UK has the highest Covid death toll in Europe.At first anyone with symptoms of Covid-19 was tested and attempts made to track their close contacts, but the system was abandoned on March 12.For more than two months, only hospital cases, staff with symptoms and suspected clusters of transmission received tests.It was not until May 28 that a national system to test anyone with symptoms was introduced.Germany is regarded as having Europe's best system. Most people were tested in a clinical setting, but did not have to go to hospital.GPs were able to order tests, to be carried out at centres around the country.Home tests were conducted on those who had been in contact with an infected person.Hospitals set up isolation wards for virus patients.France requisitioned all face-masks for health workers early on and doctors and nurses wore medical-grade face-masks most of the time.French hospitals kept suspected cases separate from other patients.Health authorities told people with suspected symptoms not to go to hospitals or GPs' surgeries, but to call the emergency number and wait for medical teams to come to their homes.

226,Covid hotels plea to stop flouting of isolation rules,"June 10, 2020 Wednesday",International,The Times (London),648,648,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,Oliver Wright,Covid hotels plea to stop flouting of isolation rules,"Many people with Covid-19 symptoms are not self-isolating, prompting calls for Korean-style quarantine hotels.Senior members of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) behaviour insights group said they had seen evidence that even those with a cough and fever were not, or could not, follow advice to self-isolate.Their evidence to the Lords science and technology committee came as one Whitehall source said that government figures for those fully complying with virus rules were as low as 15 per cent.The scientists said that the new test and trace system would be ineffective unless the public clearly understood the third element of quarantine.Lucy Yardley, professor of health psychology at Bristol and Southampton universities, said: "" We have never managed to accomplish good adherence to self-isolation, not even in the earliest stages. We have data that when people thought or said they were adhering they were leaving the home while symptomatic. We have to understand better the various reasons why people are doing that, despite good intentions.""Professor Yardley, who sits on the Sage subgroup on pandemic behaviours, said that while compliance with the overall ""stay at home"" message had been excellent, adherence to quarantine measures had been less effective. These advise anyone with a cough, fever or a loss of taste and smell not to leave their home at all and as far as possible to stay away from other members of the household. Anyone in a house with a suspected Covid-19 case has to be isolated for 14 days.Even if someone tests negative for coronavirus the advice is to remain in isolation until symptoms have passed as scientists believe that between 10 and 30 per cent of tests could be giving false negative results.Given the onerous nature of the restrictions, Professor Yardley suggested that the government needed to look at extra financial support or dedicated Covid hotels to help to support the policy. ""We know a lot of [non-compliance] has to do with not having sufficient support or income,"" she said. ""We have to solve this problem of why people are not isolating as much as they need to.""There was an urgent need for more research on how people were breaking quarantine rules and the level of risk that posed. She suggested that there appeared to be financial and practical ""barriers"" to compliance that needed government support such as dedicated quarantine accommodation.""One of the problems is that the rules ask people to isolate at home, potentially putting their closest family member at greater risk,"" she said. ""We need to understand [this] much better.""Susan Michie, professor of University College London's centre for behaviour change and another member of the Sage subgroup, told the Lords committee that she was concerned that the test and trace system did not emphasise the need to self-isolate.""The thing that's puzzling is why the government called it test and trace whereas the WHO and many other countries, call it 'test, trace and isolate' because without isolation, all of the rest of it is nothing.""Ministers should put into place a support package to make this possible, she said. ""If people are being asked to stay at home for 14 days, not work, this is a big financial penalty. Unless people are financially compensated then this is going to be a big disincentive.""Many people also don't have accommodation where they can isolate themselves. Other countries provide accommodation for people so they can isolate themselves when they need to.""Professor Michie also criticised the opaque way that the government responded to evidence presented to it by Sage, with participants being given little idea whether or not their evidence was being acted upon.""We've published dozens of papers, and they are presented to Sage. But we don't have any feedback as to where those papers go, or whether the advice is used,"" she said.",Newspaper

""If they can't play with their friends, their mental health is going to suffer.""Children may well have developed secure attachment with their teachers and they have been denied access to these figures.""He also said that parents's anxiety about sending their children back to school was ""misplaced"".""We know children have a less challenging disease if they do pick it up,"" added Dr Morgan, who sits on the Scientific Pandemic Influenza Group on Behaviours (SPI-B), which feeds in to Sage (Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies).""The impact on children is minuscule in terms of their health.""Thousands of schools across the UK decided to stay closed after the government announced pupils in reception, year one and year six could return to the classroom from 1 June.Several councils in the northwest of England have also postponed reopening after new data suggested the spread of coronavirus was accelerating in the region.The government had hoped that every primary school pupil would be back in the classroom for at least a month before the summer holidays.However while school leaders have warned about the effects of spending up to six months out of school, particularly the most vulnerable pupils, unions and scientists claimed the decision to reopen at the start of the month could contribute to a ""new surge"" of cases.England's chief medical officer Chris Whitty admitted this week it was a ""very complicated balancing act for society in terms of the possibility of increasing the transmission on the one hand and depriving children of their education on the other"".Sage warned ministers that children could suffer lifelong damage to their physical and mental health, education and development because of lockdown.",Newspaper; Web Publication
228,Uncertainty over 2-metre distancing rule in England 'causing chaos';Millions spent on signage will have been wasted as shops and councils prepare for lockdown easingCoronavirus - latest updatesSee all our coronavirus coverage,"June 11, 2020 Thursday",International,The Guardian (London),832,832,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,"Peter Walker, Hannah Devlin and Heather Stewart",Uncertainty over 2-metre distancing rule in England 'causing chaos'Millions spent on signage will have been wasted as shops and councils prepare for lockdown easingCoronavirus - latest updatesSee all our coronavirus coverage,"Any government decision to reduce the 2-metre physical distancing rule in England could mean councils and retailers will have wasted millions of pounds on signs and other preparations for the reopening of high streets, it has emerged.Local authorities and retail groups told the Guardian that much of a £50m government fund handed out to councils in England in recent weeks had been spent on signs and barriers based on 2-metre distancing, much of which would need to be scrapped if the distance was reduced.The government has said only that the distance is under review. However, Conservative MPs are increasingly pushing for a reduction to           1 metre, saying this would greatly assist shops, many more of which can reopen from Monday, and then pubs, restaurants and cafes.While retail groups say a 1-metre distance would be a boost for shops, they have expressed frustration at the lack of notice. Some council leaders, meanwhile, said confusion over the measure epitomised a chaotic central government approach to the pandemic.In the past few weeks, the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government (MHCLG) has distributed grants from the £50m Reopening High Streets Safely Fund  to councils across England, to be used on signage and barriers on streets and in shops.Tudor Evans, the Labour leader of Plymouth council, which has received £235,000 from the fund, said it had been used for large numbers of discs on street surfaces indicating 2-metre distances, and to help hundreds of shops prepare. These measures would need to be redone if the distance was reduced.""If it changes in the next few weeks it will make people angry,"" Evans said. ""A lot of people have sent a lot of time in the public sector, and in the private sector, to get things ready for opening up in accordance with government regulations. To have this uncertainty, this close to opening, is really an emblem for how chaotic the government's handling has been.""Andrew Goodacre, the chief executive of the British Independent Retailers Association, which represents smaller shops, said any reduction would receive a mixed reception from members.""At 1 metre you can double your capacity, so from a business point of view it's beneficial,"" he said. ""But on the negative side, for three months we have delivered a very strong message on 2 metres, and all the signage says 2 metres, so that would all need changing. So I think the enthusiasm of more capacity would be tempered with frustration with having to change some or all of the signage.""The former Conservative leader Iain Duncan Smith is among the Tory backbenchers pushing for a change, telling the BBC that reducing the 2-metre rule was ""the critical component around which everything coming out of lockdown hinges"".On Thursday Boris Johnson's spokesman said the 2-metre rule was ""always kept under review"" and was among a number of contagion risk factors that were being considered.Amid the uncertainty, some councils have taken matters into their own hands. Steve Houghton, the Labour leader of Barnsley council, which received £240,000 from the MHCLG fund, said local signs did not specify a distance.""We decided this is going to change,"" he said. ""So we do have some signs with 2 metres on, but the bulk has been saying things like 'stay apart', 'keep your distance', that kind of thing. It might be 1 metre this time tomorrow.""Houghton said he felt this summed up the central government approach: ""They seem to be reacting to situations rather than reading situations - that seems to be the case all the way through, whether care homes or PPE. Is the virus managing the government or is the government managing the virus?""Advice given by the environmental and modelling group of the government's Sage scientific advice body on 26 April was that the risk from face-to-face contact drops to an acceptable level at 2 metres.Scientists say any change of advice would have to be backed by clear rationale on how the epidemic is being managed. ""No measure should be seen in isolation,"" said Prof Susan Michie, the director of the Centre for Behaviour Change at University College London. ""One would expect measures to be part of an overall strategy, but we haven't seen that. We're just having different announcements about different things at different times - things are being suddenly sprung on people because of political expediency.""Michie said a concern over replacing the 2-metre guidance with 1 metre would be that to many people it would signal things going ""back to normal"".""If you begin to say that 2 metres doesn't matter any more - because that's how it will be seen - it undermines the mental model of how transmission happens that's so carefully been built up over the past few months,"" she said. ""It seems to me that now is not the time to be lifting restrictions unless there's a very good argument. The risks will be higher and more people will get ill.""The MHCLG said it could not comment on speculation about a change to the rules.",Newspaper
229,Independent SAGE' group says UK's Test and Trace scheme is 'not fit for purpose' and urges ministers to overhaul system that will 'help not hinder' country's recovery,"June 9, 2020 Tuesday",International,MailOnline,1211,1211,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,Bhvishya Patel For Mailonline,Independent SAGE' group says UK's Test and Trace scheme is 'not fit for purpose' and urges ministers to overhaul system that will 'help not hinder' country's recovery,"•Experts have argued system is 'severely constrained by lack of co-ordination'•Say virus will only be contained if 80 per cent of contacts of infected are traced•The independent Sage group have now urged ministers to overhaul the system                     The UK's Test and Trace programme which is aimed at breaking the chain of transmission as quickly as possible is 'not fit for purpose', an independent group of scientists have claimed. The group of 12 experts, led by former Government chief scientific adviser Sir David King, who now leads the independent SAGE group, have argued that the system is 'severely constrained by 'lack of co-ordination, lack of trust' and a 'lack of evidence of utility'.The scientists say that Covid-19 will only be contained if 80 per cent of the contacts of infected people are traced and contacted but they think this is 'impossible' under the current centralised system using 25,000 contact tracers. The independent Sage group have now urged ministers to overhaul the system designed to help the country out of the coronavirus lockdown. Sir David said this is the 'critical moment for the Government to act now or risk further spikes' and the group believe a tracing and isolating system led by local health bodies would be more effective. In their report into test and trace, released today, the experts say the approach is 'severely constrained by lack of co-ordination, lack of trust, lack of evidence of utility', and contacts being found and isolating for 14 days 'is clearly not happening'.The group, known as Independent Sage, was set up after the official Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) had faced criticism over not being transparent.[related]Sir David added: 'The Government has placed huge emphasis on their test, track and trace system in recent weeks, even labelling it ''world beating''.'It is clear from our research that this simply isn't the case, indeed the system as it stands is not fit for purpose.'He continued: 'We are calling on the Government to urgently rethink their course to ensure that we have a system in place that will help and not hinder the country's recovery.' Under the Track and Trace scheme, Britons who have been in close contact with infected patients are being told to self-isolate for 14 days, even if they are asymptomatic.The scheme will require anyone who develops symptoms associated with the coronavirus to get tested by ordering a test online or by calling 119.If a patient tests positive they must remain in isolation and will be asked to share phone numbers and email addresses for close contacts. Those who are listed will then receive a text message or email asking them to self-isolate for 14 days depending on the point at which they came in contact with the infected person. The system is designed to break the chain of transmission as quickly as possible in order to squash potential outbreaks and stop them from escalating. Earlier today Sage scientist Professor Susan Michie, a psychologist at University College London, criticised the Government's decision to leave out the word 'isolate' from its coronavirus Test and Trace programme, claiming it would lead to less compliance.Professor Michie, who is also director of UCL's Centre for Behaviour Change, said isolating cases was the most vital part of the system and not including it in the title of the UK's flagship scheme was 'puzzling'. She told the House of Lords Science and Technology Committee today: 'The other thing that is very puzzling to me is why the government has called it Test and Trace, when the World Health Organization (WHO) and many other countries call it Test, Trace and Isolate.'Because without isolation all of the rest of it is for nothing. We absolutely need the isolation. And if one doesn't have it in the label of the system, it's not communicating that this is a vital part of it.'We already know there are going to be really big difficulties with isolation if people are being asked to stay home for 14 days and not go to work, this is a big financial penalty.'Today figures from the Department of Health showed that Britain's coronavirus death toll today jumped by 286, with 277 of the Covid-19 victims from England and nine from Wales. What is the NHS Test and Trace system?  Anyone who develops Covid-associated symptoms is being told to self-isolate and get tested under the test and trace scheme.Close contacts of those who are found to be positive for the disease are then told to quarantine for 14 days - even if they test negative and are not sick. Boris Johnson's government has hired an enormous army of 50,000 people who will attempt to make this huge undertaking possible. Around 25,000 are contact tracers who will contact people who return positive coronavirus tests to grill them on their movements and their known associates. The idea is to build a picture of who they have come into contact with and so who might be at risk of a) becoming ill and b) passing it on to more people. Another 25,000 people in the scheme are testers, who will go out into the community and test these known associates.Either way, these known associates will be under orders to immediately quarantine, even if the tests they return are negative. Baroness Dido Harding, executive chairwoman of NHS Test and Trace, said the scheme was central to easing the lockdown further.She said: 'NHS Test and Trace is designed to enable the vast majority of us to be able to get on with our lives in a much more normal way. 'We will be trading national lockdown for individual isolation if we have symptoms.'Instead of 60 million people being in national lockdown, a much smaller number of us will be told we need to stay at home, either for seven days if we are ill or 14 days if we have been in close contact.' The UK's coronavirus tracing programme will be split into two parts.•Part One:People will be ordered to self-isolate for seven days if they develop symptoms. Anyone in the same household will have to do the same. Those people should then order a coronavirus test online or by calling 119. This will be available for residents in Wales from Saturday.If a test is positive, that victim must complete seven days in isolation. If the test comes back negative, no one needs to self-isolate.However, people with a positive test for Covid-19 will then be contacted via text message or email or by phone and told to answer questions.They will be asked to share phone numbers and email addresses for close contacts.For those under 18, they will receive a call from the team and a parent or guardian must give permission for the call to continue. •Part Two:People who have been listed as a person with whom a coronavirus victim has had close contact will receive a text message or an email.They will then be asked to self-isolate for up to 14 days based on when they last came into contact with that person.Other household members do not need to self-isolate unless symptoms are present.If they develop Covid-associated symptoms, all other household members should self-isolate and they should then order a test.If the test is positive, self-isolation must continue for seven days.

230,"No 10 must regain public's trust to avoid second wave, scientists warn;Repairing damage 'central' to ensuring people follow UK self-isolation rules, say Sage expertsCoronavirus - latest updatesSee all our coronavirus coverage","June 9, 2020 Tuesday",International,The Guardian (London),682,682,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,Ian Sample Science editor,"No 10 must regain public's trust to avoid second wave, scientists warnRepairing damage 'central' to ensuring people follow UK self-isolation rules, say Sage expertsCoronavirus - latest updatesSee all our coronavirus coverage","Ministers need to rebuild public trust in their handling of the coronavirus outbreak and compensate people for lost earnings when asked to self-isolate to prevent a resurgence of the epidemic, leading scientists have warned.Prof Susan Michie, a psychologist on a subgroup of the Scientific Advisory Group on Emergencies (Sage), said public confidence in the UK's handling of the crisis had fallen in recent weeks and that repairing the damage was ""central"" to ensuring people followed advice to contain the epidemic as the country emerged from lockdown.""There has been a dent in trust of the government to manage the pandemic over the last month, but especially over the last couple of weeks, and building that up is going to be central to managing a second wave,"" Michie told the Lords science committee.As restrictions ease across the UK, health officials will look to the new test-and-trace system to help contain the virus. Under the system, close contacts of people who develop symptoms and test positive will be asked to stay at home for 14 days.But Prof Lucy Yardley, a member of the Sage committee of experts, told the Lords hearing that people had not generally been good at self-isolating even at the start of the epidemic. ""We have data showing that when people thought or said they were adhering, they were nevertheless leaving the home while symptomatic,"" she said.In many cases, people who were meant to be self-isolating with Covid-19 symptoms left home because they did not have others to buy shopping or collect prescriptions, or simply because they needed to work. In England, Department of Health tracking data suggests that only half of people who developed a cough or fever abided by the rules to self-isolate.""We already know there are going to be big difficulties with self-isolation if people are going to be asked to stay at home for 14 days and not go to work,"" Michie told the hearing. ""This is a big financial penalty, so unless people are financially compensated, it's going to be a big disincentive for taking part in it at all.""Michie, who told the committee there was a lack of transparency in how scientific advice flowed through to policy, said the government was not helping by calling the system ""test and trace"" instead of adopting the World Health Organization's terminology of ""test, trace and isolate"". ""If it doesn't have it on the label, it's not communicating that this is a vital part of it,"" she said. ""Without isolation, all the rest of it is for nothing.""Other scientists who gave evidence to the peers raised further doubts about the government's strategy to contain the epidemic. Sir John Burn, a professor of clinical genetics at Newcastle University, praised the ""Lighthouse labs"", a series of facilities set up to perform virus tests, but said they were too far away for many hospitals to perform tests quickly enough. ""What we need to see happen is NHS labs being allowed or encouraged to take this testing back in-house,"" he said. This would put test results directly into the hands of local doctors and ensure testing was ""hardwired into the NHS"".""While lighthouse labs are wonderful, they are really too far away from most parts of the country to give us that same-day turnaround so we need to get our hospital laboratories back into the game,"" he said. ""We've already started to run into problems with frontline teams isolated for long periods, so testing will allow us to get people back into work,"" he added.Because infected people can spread the virus before they develop symptoms, or without symptoms ever showing, scientists on Sage concluded in May that for test and trace to be effective, 80% of contacts would have to be isolated within 48 hours of the infected person first developing symptoms. In many cases it takes longer than that for a test result to be returned.""Testing needs to be made possible at scale in the very early stages if we're to have an impact on the spread of the disease, and at the moment we still don't have the scale of testing or the accessibility of testing to really meet that challenge,"" Burn said.",Newspaper
231,Scientists at war with ministers over Covid: Experts call for public inquiry into government's 'failures' and warn 'many more will die' because second wave now 'seems probable' this winter,"June 6, 2020 Saturday",International,MailOnline,2016,2016,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,Connor Boyd Health Reporter For Mailonline,Scientists at war with ministers over Covid: Experts call for public inquiry into government's 'failures' and warn 'many more will die' because second wave now 'seems probable' this winter,"•Nearly 30 leading experts have demanded public inquiry into shortcomings•Second wave will be more deadly if minsters don't address them, they warn•Sent letter to PM in another sign of growing gulf between ministers and expertsNearly 30 leading experts have demanded Boris Johnson launches a public inquiry to prepare Britain for a second wave of coronavirus, in another sign of a growing gulf between ministers and scientists. The group of 27 said a second epidemic was 'probable' this winter and warned it would be more deadly than the first if the Government doesn't address its failures from the previous outbreak.They have laid out a series of glaring shortcomings which they say have contributed to the UK suffering more than 40,000 Covid-19 deaths, the highest in Europe. There was another indication of growing friction between ministers and scientists last night, when Matt Hancock led the Downing Street press conference alone - without being flanked by a SAGE member.In a scathing letter published last night, the signatories criticised the Government's control freakery approach to testing and unwillingness to devolve responsibility to local public health bodies.They also ripped into ministers for their 'inability to plan for necessary goods' such personal protective equipment (PPE) for NHS and care home workers. Among the signatories were ex SAGE scientist, Professor Deenan Pillay, a virologist at University College London, and Professor Anthony Costello, a former World Health Organization (WHO) director and a global health expert at UCL.The editors of two prestigious medical journals have also put their name to the letter - Richard Horton of the Lancet and Fiona Godlee of the British Medical Journal.It is the latest sign of brewing tensions between ministers and the country's top scientists.Last week, four experts on the Government's Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (SAGE) said the decision to ease lockdown in England would risk people's lives. In the new letter - published in the Guardian- the 27 experts said it 'seem probable' there will be a second wave in winter.They continued: 'Many more will die unless we find quick, practical solutions to some of the structural problems that have made implementing an effective response so difficult.'These include the fragmentation, in England, of the NHS, public health and social care; the failure of those in Westminster to engage with local government and devolved nations; the channels by which scientific evidence feeds into policy; and an inability to plan for necessary goods and services, and procure them.'The signatories include leading professors in virology, public health and epidemiology (the study of diseases in different groups of people) at the country's best universities.                     SCIENTISTS DEMAND COVID PUBLIC INQUIRY: THE LETTER IN FULL                                         The letter was published in the Guardian today.Despite strenuous efforts by health professionals and scientists inside and outside government, the UK has experienced one of the highest death rates from Covid-19 in the world, with the poor and certain minority ethnic groups affected especially badly.If, as seems probable, there is a second wave this winter, many more will die unless we find quick, practical solutions to some of the structural problems that have made implementing an effective response so difficult. These include the fragmentation, in England, of the NHS, public health and social care; the failure of those in Westminster to engage with local government and devolved nations; the channels by which scientific evidence feeds into policy; and an inability to plan for necessary goods and services, and procure them.We call on all political parties to commit to a rapid, transparent, expert inquiry to address these issues. This must avoid diverting the efforts of those responding to the crisis or apportioning blame, but should propose feasible ways to overcome the obstacles faced by those on the frontline of the response and help them to save lives. They said the death rate in the UK has been high despite 'strenuous efforts by health professionals and scientists inside and outside government ... with the poor and certain minority ethnic groups affected especially badly'.Office for National Statistics reports have shown the poorest in society are twice as likely to die from Covid-19 as the richest.And Black, Asian and Minority Ethic (BAME) groups are also disproportionately affected by the disease.Reacting to the letter, Professor Paul Hunter, an epidemiologist at the University of East Anglia, told MailOnline: 'Personally I do not think it is time for a public inquiry.'But it is time that the Government comes up with a better way of achieving scientific consensus and that includes seeking out different opinions and presenting the evidence in a better way than currently.'[Today's] letter is interesting, more for who co-authored it rather than its content. There is hardly a modeller on the list, which is largely drawn from public health experts and epidemiologists.'One of the recurring criticisms with the scientific contribution to this epidemic has been the reliance on mathematical modellers to the general exclusion of traditional public health epidemiologists and practitioners.'Public health specialists and public health microbiologists have been the professionals that have managed communicable disease problems since World War II and to me it has been disappointing that this expertise has not been used as much as I think it should have. 'Part of the issue has been the move of public health into political departments that has certainly stifled debate and has meant that many enthusiastic bright public health doctors and specialists are now civil servants with much less freedom of action and expression.'The UK Government has not yet committed to a public inquiry into the pandemic in Britain, but Cabinet ministers have admitted there will be 'lessons to be learned' when it's over.But the experts in today's letter make it clear an investigation is needed immediately because the virus is threatening to spiral back out of control already, just a week after lockdown was eased slightly.Estimates by Public Health England and Cambridge University suggest the R-rate - the average number of people each Covid-19 patient infects - is above the danger level of one in the North West and South West of England. It must stay below one or Britain will face another crisis.The PHE/Cambridge team - whose model is based on death data from NHS England and regional health officials, antibody surveillance sampling and mobility reports - calculated that the crucial 'R' reproduction rate fell to just 0.4 in the capital in the aftermath of the lockdown being introduced.However, the rate in London - as well as other regions - slowly began to creep up to between 0.7-0.8 before moving closer to one in the past few weeks.At the beginning of the outbreak London was the worst affected region but the latest numbers suggest it is now ahead of all but one region in terms of recovery.The data, published by the university, shows London is recording 1,310 cases each day - behind only the South West (778).In contrast, the North West of England is recording 4,100 daily infections and has an R rate of 1.01, the highest for any region in the country.The South West also has an estimated R rate of 1. While the North East and Yorkshire is the only area to still be in the 0.8s.It comes after four Sage experts warned that relaxing lockdown restrictions at this time risked the R spiralling out of control and causing a second epidemic.Professor John Edmunds, from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and a member of Sage, said he would have preferred to see the R brought down much lower before opening back up. Sir Jeremy Farrar, director of the Wellcome Trust and a member of Sage, said on Twitter that Covid-19 is 'spreading too fast to lift lockdown in England' and NHS test and trace 'has to be fully working and infection rates have to be lower'.Professor Peter Horby, from Oxford University, who sits on Sage and chairs its NERVTAG subcommittee, agreed, saying the R number was still close to one.He told the BBC last week: 'What I would say is that returning to a situation where we lost control again is far worse than another week or two of social measures,' he said.A fourth Sage member, Professor Calum Semple, said a 'brave' political decision had been made, which did not align with the science. He told the BBC: 'Essentially we're lifting the lid on a boiling pan and it's just going to bubble over,' he said. 'We need to get it down to simmer before we take the lift off, and it's too early.' Fears of a second wave of coronavirus were raised yesterday when Iran has become the first country in the world to report a second epidemic. The Middle Eastern nation logged a record 3,574 cases of the virus on Wednesday, beating its previous worst day of 3,186 cases logged on March 30.Iran began easing its lockdown restrictions - which were imposed in February as the virus ran rampant - in mid-April as the disease declined.Cases began picking up again in early May and have now been above 3,000 for three days running, even as gyms and public offices were reopened at the weekend.

Flu is not a good model because this behaves differently. I am a second wave sceptic.""There have been no flu-like second waves (or even peaks) in China, South Korea or New Zealand. There was no second wave with Sars, another coronavirus.""He suggested random Covid-19 testing in supermarket queues may be needed to get the virus' transmission down.He said if the test and trace system did not work well the only alternative was compulsory arbitrary testing.The leading microbiologist said: ""Test and trace is only going to work if people sign up to it. The only other way out would be massive random testing in places like supermarket queues.""It would need to be backed up with legislation, but we will need to do this if we don't get the transmission down.""If mass testing and contact tracing were ramped up Britain may be virus free by the new year, he added.Professor Pennington questioned the effectiveness of the tough lockdown measures.He told The Times: ""If the lockdown had been so brilliant we would have had fewer cases.""Lockdown has only stopped big outbreaks, it has not stopped the virus getting into care homes, which is a real scandal. We are going in the right direction with getting the number of cases down but it is too slow.

We have to get this right.""It comes after thousands of people flouted the rules on Saturday and were spotted gathering in large groups at beaches, parks and beautyspots, with many pictured boozing in the sun.Packed crowds were spotted at Durdle Door in Dorset, with Durdle Door and Lulworth Cove closed to public after four injured jumping 200ft into sea after four people were seriously injured cliff-jumping.Prof Van-Tam said scientific opinions ""always vary to some extent"", and told the press conference that the lockdown easing must go ""painstakingly"" slowly.He added: ""This is a dual responsibility here of Government to go slowly and carefully and to take the advice from the scientists.""Of the scientists, to watch this whole thing very closely over the next few weeks. And, of the public in general to actually follow the guidance.""Don't tear the pants out of it, and don't go further than the guidance actually says.""The comments came as Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden announced that elite sport events would begin again next week behind closed doors.Declaring that ""football is coming back"", Mr Dowden said: ""Football, tennis, horseracing, Formula 1, cricket, golf, rugby, snooker and others are all set to return to our screens shortly.""I'm glad to confirm today that a third of matches to finish the season will now be free to view including the Liverpool v Everton derby and live Premier League football will be on the BBC for the first time in its history.""COVIDIOTS! People jump from huge height in stupid stunt at Durdle DoorAsked for his response to experts who have expressed concern the lockdown is being eased too quickly in England, Mr Dowden said it must be remembered there are more than 50 scientists in the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies Sage, ""all of whom will have their different perspectives"".He told the daily briefing that scientists are ""absolutely right to urge caution"".But Professor Robert West, a participant in the Scientific Pandemic Influenza Group on Behaviours SPI-B which advises Sage, emphasised on Saturday that some 8,000 infections and 400 deaths a day are still occurring.The Observer reported that a letter sent by 26 senior UK academics and health administrators to Downing Street complained about the impact of the Dominic Cummings controversy.The group also warned about a failure to enact an effective test, trace and isolate system to pinpoint and then quarantine newly infected people.As a result, they are now ""very concerned for the safety and wellbeing of the general public"" as the lockdown measures are relaxed, the newspaper reported.The easing of England's lockdown will also signal the reopening of schools to allow more students to return, while outdoor retailers and car showrooms are also able to reopen.Asked if he agrees it is too soon to ease more of the lockdown, Prof Horby told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""Actually, I do. We have still got 8,000 cases a day.""He added that although measures taken so far ""have been very successful in... decreasing the numbers"", it is vital ""we don't lose control again"".He said one of the key issues is the NHS Test and Trace system, which has been rolled out across England with the help of 25,000 contact tracers.But the programme will not be operational at a local level until the end of next month, while an accompanying app is delayed by several weeks.Thousands flout beach closures and walk five miles to sunbathe during UK lockdownProf Horby added: ""We are entering a period where there is a risk of increasing transmission, but we don't yet have that safety net fully in place.""In Scotland, people can now meet others from one other household at a time as long as it is outdoors, but social distancing should continue and groups must be a maximum of eight people.People in Wales will be allowed to meet up with others outdoors from Monday.In Northern Ireland, more retailers can open and small outdoor weddings will receive the go-ahead from June 8 if the coronavirus infection rate remains under control.",Newspaper; Web Publication

While the chief scientific officer, Patrick Vallance, said on Thursday that he did ""not want to get involved in politics"", Van-Tam said he was ""quite happy"" to answer the question.""In my opinion the rules are clear and they have always been clear,"" he said. ""In my opinion they are for the benefit of all. In my opinion they apply to all.""Earlier in the day one of the government's scientific advisers warned that the Cummings affair has eroded trust in its authority, while a growing number of other government advisers            voiced unease over the decision to lift England's lockdown, warning that loosening restrictions could easily lead to a second wave.Prof Robert West, a member of the scientific pandemic influenza group on behaviours (SPI-B) that advises Sage (the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies), said the decision by Cummings to travel from London to Durham during the full lockdown would have an impact on people adhering to the latest rules.The UCL scientist said: ""Trust in authority telling you to do things is very important when it comes to people adhering to those rules. When people see something like the Cummings affair ... that's not a recipe for trust.""It came as the culture secretary Oliver Dowden announced that football, tennis, horseracing, Formula One, cricket, golf, rugby and snooker would start up again. Groups of up to six people from different households will be able to exercise together from Monday, while maintaining a distance of 2 metres, he said.Billed as the recovery of British sport, the move will allow teams to play together and take part in conditioning and fitness sessions which do not involve physical contact.""Today I am also glad to confirm that we are relaxing the rules on exercise further so that from Monday people will be able to exercise with up to five others from different households, crucially, so long as they remain two metres apart,"" he said. ""The British sporting recovery has begun.""Dowden added that the government has published guidance to allow elite sport to resume behind closed doors, with guidelines on how to get athletes back into socially distanced training and then back into close-contact training.Boris Johnson has announced a gradual easing of the lockdown in England from Monday, when friends and relatives will be able to meet in parks and gardens in socially distanced groups of six.""Happy Monday"" will also signal the reopening of schools - allowing children in nurseries, early-years settings, reception, year 1 and year 6 to return to class - as well as more shops, with outdoor retail and car showrooms able to resume operations.Van-Tam agreed that it was a ""dangerous moment"" and that scientists were right to urge caution but he added that scientific opinions always vary to some extent ""across the piste"".He went on to urge the public to continue to comply with the guidance saying that otherwise the virus could get out of control.""Don't see this as a curve that's the same going up as it is down, it's quite easy for it to go up, [but] it's quite hard to get the brakes on to go back down,"" he said.""So I really hope that people will follow the advice that's given to the letter, and not any further than that, to make sure we're never in that position again.""",Newspaper
235,MASK OF CORO How to make a face mask at home,"June 4, 2020 Thursday",International,thesun.co.uk,1442,1442,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,Gemma Mullin,MASK OF CORO How to make a face mask at home,"                     FACE masks have been made compulsory to wear on public transport and while shopping in stores.                   The new rules, brought in on July 24, were introduced in a bid to battle the spread of coronavirus.                                              Read our coronavirus live blog for the latest news & updates                   Brits now have to wear face masks when entering shops - or face being fined.Face coverings are also mandatory on trains, buses, ferries, and aircraft to prevent a second peak of coronavirus in the UK.On August 8, Prime Minister Boris Johnson also announced that face masks will be mandatory in places where people are likely to come into contact with people they do not know, for example museums, places of worship and cinemas. And while there are many good sources to bulk buy masks for a reasonable price, you can never beat a cost-cutting DIY expedition.                      How to make a homemade face mask                   Health officials have strongly urged the public not to buy up surgical masks, which are vital for frontline health workers to protect themselves while treating patients.Instead, Brits have been advised to try making their own at home version.Homemade masks won't offer the same protection as medical-grade masks, but experts say they still work to some level.One of the simplest ways to make one at home is to use paper you already have at home - just take two layers of kitchen roll and one tissue cut in half.You then cover each end with masking tape, punch two holes in and thread elastic or a hair tie through to fit around your ears.If you want to stiffen it so that it is more secure you can add some wire into the ends before taping them up.                     T-shirt technique                   Another method involves using a T-shirt without the need for any sewing or stitching.A YouTube tutorial by Runa Ray explains that for the t-shirt method, you need to cut out a 16in by 4in rectangle from the material.Then fold it in half and measure 4in on either side before making an equal number of cuts along the edges with scissors.Then turn the fabric inside out and knot each of the tails, but leave the four outer edges.Cut two more strips of material and tie them to the ends - these are the straps that will go around your ears.Some people have also used a vacuum cleaner bag to create a face mask, which is a bit more complicated - and only works if you have a spare, clean bag to hand.The Government has also released instructions on how to make a face mask from a T-shirt.                     What else can be used as a face covering?                   You don't have to make your own homemade face mask to keep yourself safe. A face covering can be as simple as a scarf or bandana that ties behind the head.It should cover your mouth and nose while allowing you to breathe comfortably.                      How to wear a face mask safely                   Before putting your face mask on, wash your hands or use hand sanitiser and repeat after taking it off. Avoid touching your eyes, nose, or mouth at all times and store used face coverings in a plastic bag until you have an opportunity to wash them.Do not touch the front of the face covering, or the part of the face covering that has been in contact with your mouth and nose. Once removed, make sure you clean any surfaces the face covering has touched.You should wash a face covering regularly - it can go in with other laundry, using your normal detergent.                     Who should wear a mask?                   The Government says that face coverings should not be used by children under the age of three or those who may find it difficult to manage them correctly.For example, primary age children unassisted, or those with respiratory conditions.Children should also only wear a face mask under the supervision of an adult.People with disabilites, breathing difficulties and children are exempt from wearing face masks in stores and on public transport. These people have been asked to download an exemption card from the TfL website so that they can show staff when asked about wearing a face covering.                     Do masks work?                   Experts are still pretty divided on their effectiveness outside of a medical setting.Wearing a mask can act as a physical barrier to prevent infecting others if you are sick by blocking the droplets that come out when you cough or sneeze.The Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies that is advising the government said the evidence that masks slow the spread is ""marginal but positive"".But some experts argue that people can accidentally infect themselves when taking a mask off or they can lead to complacency with other measures such as hand-washing.As soon as you touch the mask having put it on it becomes redundant, some say.New evidence from Hong Kong about face masks has been shared confidentially with the World Health Organisation.The data hasn't been made public yet but it reportedly suggests that the protective gear was effective in slowing the spread in Asian countries.Professor Susan Michie, of University College London, said there is ""not good evidence"" to suggest wearing masks will cut transmissions.She said: ""They do not protect against the virus getting into the eyes - only close fitting goggles do this.""People may not fit the masks properly or take them on and off. Touching face masks and not taking them off in the correct way may mean people contaminate their hands and spread the virus.""People may have a false sense of reassurance and thus pay less attention to other behaviours key to reducing transmission such as social distancing and hand-washing.""Paul Hunter, a professor in medicine at the University of East Anglia, reviewed 31 studies which looked at the efficacy of face masks in preventing respiratory illness.He said the research was poor, adding that it was ""as easy to make an argument for opposing the widespread use of masks as it would be to make an argument promoting their use"".Most experts are in agreement that for masks to work as they are intended, they must be used correctly.Dr Jenna Macciochi, a lecturer in immunology at the University of Sussex, told the Mail: ""To be effective, a mask has to be fitted correctly, worn correctly and disposed of correctly - which is not something the general public has been trained in.""She added that not wearing one correctly is potentially more hazardous than not using one at all, as you may infect yourself with the particles the mask is protecting you against when you take it off.The WHO says surgical masks can only help when used with other preventative measures such as frequent hand-washing.                     What is the guidance on masks in the UK?                   From August 8 the compulsory wearing of face masks is being extended in England to many indoor areas.Masks will need to be worn in public spaces such as cinemas, museums, hair salons and places of worship.Face masks were made mandatory for people to wear on public transport from June 15 and people are now required to wear masks in shops, which came into force from July 24.On July 14, Matt Hancock confirmed it would be mandatory for people in England to wear face masks in shops.Anyone spotted flouting the new rules could be hit with a £100 fine. Shopkeepers have been asked to implement the new rules in their stores.Passengers on public transport have already been told to wear masks when travelling, with commuters refused travel if they aren't wearing oneTransport Secretary Grant Shappshas urged people to only wear face coverings - such as a scarf, piece of cloth or mask- and not surgical masks which should be reserved for health staff.Commuters should expect to see signs at stations and transport hubs outlining the new rules.Speaking on May 5, the UK Government's chief scientific adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance, said wearing face masks had a ""marginal but positive"" impact on the spread of infection.""Where masks may have a role is where distancing isn't possible, where there might be undue crowding,"" he added.But Sir Patrick says wearing a mask should not replace social distancing and hand washing - which are both vital.

236,"UK experts call for coronavirus inquiry to prevent deadly second wave;Many more will die unless we fix structural problems that have blighted Britain's response, say scientistsCoronavirus - latest updatesSee all our coronavirus coverage","June 5, 2020 Friday",International,The Guardian (London),887,887,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,Rowena Mason Deputy political editor,"UK experts call for coronavirus inquiry to prevent deadly second waveMany more will die unless we fix structural problems that have blighted Britain's response, say scientistsCoronavirus - latest updatesSee all our coronavirus coverage","Leading medics and scientists have called on Boris Johnson to order a public inquiry to prepare Britain for a second wave of the coronavirus this winter, warning that many more will die unless the country improves its response.The 27 experts, of which more than half are professors in virology, public health, epidemiology and other relevant fields, said there was an urgent need to fix shortcomings in Westminster's coronavirus response, which have contributed to the UK suffering one of the highest death rates in the world.Signatories to a letter to the Guardian include            Prof Anthony Costello, a former World Health Organization director and a global health expert at University College London; Prof Trisha Greenhalgh, a primary care expert at the University of Oxford; Prof Deenan Pillay, a former member of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies and an expert in virology at UCL; and            Prof Devi Sridhar, chair of global public health at the University of Edinburgh. In the letter - organised by March for Change, a grassroots campaign group supported by science and health professionals - they wrote that it ""seems probable"" that there will be a second wave of coronavirus this winter. They say that ""many more will die unless we find quick, practical solutions to some of the structural problems that have made implementing an effective response so difficult"".They said the death rate in the UK has been high despite ""strenuous efforts by health professionals and scientists inside and outside government ... with the poor and certain minority ethnic groups affected especially badly"". The experts listed the problems that need addressing as ""the fragmentation of the NHS, public health and social care in England; the failure of those in Westminster to engage with local government and devolved nations; the channels by which scientific evidence feeds into policy; and an inability to plan for the necessary goods and services and procure them. ""We call on all political parties to commit to a rapid, transparent, expert inquiry to address these issues,"" they wrote. ""This must avoid diverting the efforts of those responding to the crisis or apportioning blame but should propose feasible ways to overcome the obstacles faced by those on the front line of the response and help them to save lives.""Other signatories include professors Helen Ward, Karl Friston, Mark Gilthorpe, Ruth Gilbert, Sir Ian Gilmore, Raj Bhopal, Nuala McGrath, Susan Michie and David McCoy. The editors of two leading medical publications have also signed - Fiona Godlee of the British Medical Journal and Richard Horton of the Lancet.Johnson's government has not yet committed to a public inquiry into the coronavirus response, but some ministers have conceded there will be a time for ""lessons to be learned"" after the crisis is over.However, the experts in their letter made clear that they believe such an exercise is necessary now, so that the response can be improved if the virus resurges later this year.Many of the signatories have been high-profile critics of the government's response so far, which some public health professionals in particular believe has failed to draw sufficiently on their expertise.Johnson insisted this week that he was ""very proud"" of the government's record on reducing the spread of the virus, but the death toll has            now topped 50,000 - more than twice the total that his chief scientific adviser said would be a ""good result"".The government's difficulties have been compounded by a revolt among Johnson's own Tory MPs over the new policy of a 14-day quarantine for inbound travellers, which they argue will destroy the aviation industry and prevent foreign holidays for Britons.Many backbench Conservative MPs are already restive over Johnson's backing for his senior aide, Dominic Cummings, over his breaches of the lockdown, which prompted a deluge of mail from angry constituents.Their discontent was then compounded this week when No 10 insisted that the virtual parliament must be scrapped and MPs return to work as normal, with socially distanced queues snaking around the Palace of Westminster estate and MPs who are shielding initially denied the right to participate. They will now be allowed to vote by proxy.The government is also under pressure over its contact tracing operation, which one executive suggested would not be fully ""world-beating"" until the autumn, and the non-appearance of its tracing app, which was promised by June.There is further uneasiness among scientists and the public about the speed at which the government is unwinding the lockdown in England while the infection threat level remains at 4 - meaning cases of the virus are still high or rising exponentially. Many parents and teachers have raised concerns about children returning to school in England from this week, and non-essential shops are            supposed to be opening from 15 June.To facilitate this greater return to work, Grant Shapps, the transport secretary, unveiled a further U-turn on face masks, saying coverings will be mandatory on public transport in England from 15 June to coincide with shops reopening. At the beginning of the epidemic, the government had insisted that face masks provided little benefit and            did not encourage their use.",Newspaper

238,What the Sage papers reveal about pandemic planning;Newly released minutes show the repercussions of unprecedented policies considered by advisers Public protection,"May 30, 2020 Saturday",International,The Daily Telegraph (London),1043,1043,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,Sarah Knapton,What the Sage papers reveal about pandemic planningNewly released minutes show the repercussions of unprecedented policies considered by advisers Public protection,"Regional lockdown This would never work in Britain because it would be impossible to police and would make people feel angry when they realised they were no longer ""in it together' with the rest of the country, psychologists warned the Government.An undated paper authored by Clifford Stott, professor of social psychology at Keele University, said that imposing local restrictions would be unenforceable with current technology.Prof Stott said ""neighbourhoodlevel release"" had merit in theory, and could work in less democratic countries"", but argued it would not be suitable for implementation in the UK.""Large towns and cities in the UK have evolved piecemeal, and in most cases, cannot be subdivided, or easily policed, into containable geographical units,"" he said. ""Selective locking off or release from areas within urban centres may not only fragment public support for government measures but could lead to significant public disorder.""Anger arising from communities who perceived they have been locked down unfairly would be directed at police in the majority of cases,"" he said.The paper warned that support for measures was contingent on a ""sense of equality of sacrifice, we're all in together"", and said regional lockdown ""undermines this core proposition"".There were also fears that deprived areas would be more at risk of regional lockdown because they were more susceptible to the virus, leading to inequality and social unrest.Public transport Buses and trains should be blasted with ultraviolet (UV) light and fumigated to prevent the spread of coronavirus, the Environmental Monitoring Group (EMG) advised.An analysis of the risk of transmission on public transport from May 14 found that passengers and transport workers are at ""enhanced"" danger when travelling and measures should be taken to minimise infections.The EMG said that surfaces are likely to be contaminated and cleaning should be carried out frequently, and people warned to wash their hands.They also advised beaming UV light through carriages and buses at the end of the day to kill any remains of the virus.And they suggest minimising short-range person-to-person transmission using strategies that include physical distancing and encouraging the public to wear face coverings.Ventilation in buses and trains should also be increased to disperse the virus.""The overall weight of evidence is towards an increased risk of infection among public transport users,"" the paper concludes.""There is emerging evidence from analysis of Covid-19 outbreaks that public transport is one of the environments where SARS-CoV-2 transmission is more frequently reported.""Crime Numbers have fallen sharply under lockdown, papers from the Security & Policing Sub-Group show, but there are fears that new offences may emerge when restrictions are lifted.The report from April 21 said there had been an almost immediate and enduring decline in overall calls for help of up to 75 per cent in some areas.""This suggests the 'lockdown' led directly to major reductions in crime and criminality across society, presumably in part driven by lack of opportunity,"" said the authors.However, they warned that domestic violence had risen and there had been a surge in the number of people contacting the police to report those violating control measures.The group also advised that organised crime groups were still operating and may move into stealing high-demand items, such as face masks, or forging immunity certificates.They said that looting was unlikely unless people began to struggle to get food or suffered severe hardship because of job losses.But there were concerns about growing unrest between people living in the countryside and those in cities.""There are likely to be tensions between rural and urban areas, especially as the former will be seen as a refuge by the latter,"" said the authors.""Populations in rural areas may be more likely to resist easing of mobility restrictions than urban areas to prevent incursions from urban populations.""Acts of violence against ""tourists"" are likely to occur, as is a growing culture of local mobilisation (sometimes verging on vigilantism) to enforce social distancing.Public Disorder The Government was concerned that coronavirus and lockdown could lead to widespread social tension and conflict, the papers show.An undated report from psychologists warned that there was the potential for social division between the ""haves"" and the ""havenots"" who did not have the financial resources to weather the storm.The paper also raised concerns about vigilantism against those flouting restrictions and argued that the crisis could be hijacked by hate groups to further racist agendas.""The notion, for instance, that ethnic minority members have behaved in ways that endanger the health of the majority has been at the root of pogroms throughout history,"" said the report authors.""Hence, it is particularly important to monitor the activities of 'hate groups' and the incidence of hate crime and to make a challenge to racist rumours and reacting to incidents a key priority of neighbourhood and response policing efforts.""The researchers concluded that it was important to foster a sense of community endeavour and shared identity.Elsewhere in the documents the Security & Policing Sub-Group warned that public disorder may emerge if more relaxed measures were seen to work, such as in Sweden.Self isolation Only around half of people with coronavirus symptoms self-isolate for a week, scientists advising the Government suggested, raising concerns over the ability to prevent future outbreaks.The revelation comes in a paper from the independent Scientific Pandemic Influenza Group on Behaviours (SPI-B), which advises Sage, as test and trace begins.The document reads: ""We strongly recommend monitoring and rapid research into adherence rates to all key behaviours and how to improve them, noting that based on DHSC (Department of Health and Social Care) tracker, only around 50 per cent of people are currently reporting selfisolating for at least seven days when symptomatic with cough or fever.""And Sage minutes from May 7 say: ""Preliminary findings from a study indicate that the Covid-19 virus decays rapidly when exposed to artificial sunlight.""",Newspaper

You can't accuse me both of rushing it and it being delayed.""The launch was later plunged into chaos, with staff unable to log on amid reports some only learnt they were due to start work imminently during the prime minister's Liaison Committee hearing the previous afternoon.Boris Johnson           claims not to be aware           some migrants have 'no recourse to public funds'Over 100,000 families living legally in the UK are thought to be subject to a ""no recourse to public funds"" requirement - which denies access to most benefits. The status, blamed for causing poverty at the best of times, has created significant problems during the pandemic.When questioned by Labour MP Stephen Timms about families ""being forced by the current arrangements into destitution"", the prime minister asked why they couldn't access Universal Credit or other benefits.Once he was brought up to speed, Mr Johnson replied: ""I'm going to have to come back to you on that Stephen because clearly people who have worked hard for this country and who live and work here should have support of one kind or another.""You've raised a very important point - if the condition of their leave to remain is that they should have no recourse to public funds I will find out how many there are in that position and we will see what we can do to help.""The target to test 100,000 people per day by end of April was metOn 1 May, Mr Hancock claimed he had met his much-publicised target, delivering 122,347 tests, despite discrepancies in the data showing many of the tests counted had in fact not actually been completed yet.Angela Rayner, Labour's deputy leader, said: ""If you cannot meet your target then the response should be 'we are doing our best and testing has significantly increased' it should not be to fudge the figures. Unbelievable. and risks undermining confidence in the minister and government.""Matt Hancock fails to commit to 100,000 daily coronavirus testsWhile 73,000 people were tested on 30 April, this total was not surpassed again until 15 May, reaching a known high of 80,000 six days later. The data for the number of people tested has been unavailable since 22 May.Mr Hancock said capacity was at 161,000 on 27 May, with the prime minister having pledged to hit 200,000 by the end of the month.Ministers insist against comparing death toll internationally despite daily use of comparisons in slidesAs the UK death toll took the unenviable pole position in Europe, various ministers rubbished international comparisons before Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer pointed out the government had been making them for seven weeks in slides used at Downing Street briefings.Holding up a print-out of a government chart, he told MPs: ""Last week, I showed the prime minister his own slide showing that the UK now has the highest death toll in Europe and the second highest in the world.""A version of this slide has been shown at the Downing Street press conference every day since 30 March - that's seven weeks. Yesterday, the government stopped publishing the international comparison and the slide is gone. Why?""Mr Johnson replied: ""The UK has been going through an unprecedented once-in-a-century epidemic, and he seeks to make comparisons with other countries, which I'm advised are premature because the correct and final way of making these comparisons will be when we have all the excess death totals for all the relevant countries.""We do not yet have that data. I'm not going to try to pretend to the House that the figures when they are finally confirmed are anything other than stark and deeply, deeply horrifying. This has been an appalling epidemic.""Prime minister claims government advice on care homes from March 'wasn't true'During the same Prime Minister's Questions clash, the Labour leader alleged government advice from March saying it was ""very unlikely"" that care home residents would be infected with coronavirus laid bare how the government was ""too slow to protect people in care homes"".Mr Johnson replied: ""No, it wasn't true that the advice said that, and actually we brought the lockdown in care homes ahead of the general lockdown.""​Johnson wrongly claims advice did not dismiss care home riskBut the advice from 12 March states: ""This guidance is intended for the current position in the UK where there is currently no transmission of Covid-19 in the community. It is therefore very unlikely that anyone receiving care in a care home or the community will become infected.""Labour wrote to the PM demanding to return to the Commons to ""correct the record"". Mr Johnson rejected the claims that he had misled MPs, retorting that he was ""disappointed"" with Sir Keir's ""misleading"" use of a quote from the guidance.Matt Hancock claims 'protective ring' around care homes 'right from start'According to the Office for National Statistics, 11,650 people had died with coronavirus in care homes in England and Wales by 15 May.The health secretary said on that day: ""Right from the start, we've tried to throw a protective ring around care homes.""But this claim was disputed. Four Seasons Health Care chief executive Jeremy Richardson described this as ""disingenuous"", telling the BBC: ""That clearly wasn't the case.""The initial focus was on ensuring that there was capacity in the NHS, making sure the NHS was safe and secure. Once that had become apparent, then I think attention turned to the community and care homes as part of the community.""Boris Johnson says 'stay alert' message is 'right way to go' despite polls indicating confusionBoth housing secretary Robert Jenrick and the prime minister dismissed concerns the government's new messaging was confusing, with Mr Johnson insisting it was ""the right way to go"".It came after a YouGov survey found less than a third of people said they understood the message, with 91 per cent saying the previous ""stay home"" slogan was clearer and more effective.This followed foreign secretary Dominic Raab apparently becoming confused by the new rules, with the government forced to clarify people could not meet up with more than one person from other households simultaneously.Government defends abandoning contact-tracing in MarchWhile the WHO urged countries to ""test, test, test"" as the backbone of their response, the government abandoned contact-tracing and moved to test only suspected Covid-19 patients in hospitals.For days afterwards, ministers refused to be drawn on why England's testing strategy was so out of step with other countries. Boris Johnson says if people have been alerted by contact tracing app 'they must stay at home'On 26 March, deputy chief medical officer Dr Jenny Harries said: ""There comes a point in a pandemic where that is not an appropriate intervention."" adding that the wider public could be included if there were ""infinite testing facilities"".Amid allegations that the UK developed a test in January, yet only used one laboratory in London to process tests before eventually enlisting others, Public Health England insisted to the Financial Times: ""The rollout to other parts of the UK is the fastest deployment of a novel test to PHE and NHS labs in recent history, including in the swine flu pandemic in 2009.""Two months later, the prime minister admitted contact-tracing had been abandoned because PHE did not have the capacity, saying the ""brutal reality is this country didn't learn the lessons of Sars or Mers"", and therefore lacked test kits, enzymes and experienced trackers.Mr Hancock added that, while contact-tracing took place initially, ""as the virus raged towards its peak, the number of infections grew so large that we needed a national lockdown.""That was the only way to get it under control. Effectively, everyone in the country was contacted and told to stay at home.""Government says it missed out on EU ventilator scheme due to 'communication problem'No 10 initially said it did not join an emergency EU scheme to help procure ventilators and vital medical equipment because the UK was no longer a member state - prompting outrage the government was putting ""Brexit over breathing"".""We are no longer members of the EU,"" the prime minister's official spokesperson told reporters on 26 March. ""We are doing our own work on ventilators and we have had a very strong response from business. We have sourced ventilators from the private sector and international manufacturers.""Amid mounting criticism, the spokesperson later sought to clarify the reason, claiming the UK had missed the procurement deadline due to a ""communication problem"" which meant the country was not invited to apply in time.However, Brussels dismissed the claim, saying the scheme had been discussed at multiple meetings with UK representatives.Dominic Cummings in 'every respect acted legally, responsibly and with integrity'Durham Police has concluded the aide ""might"" have committed a ""minor breach of the regulations that would have warranted police intervention"" during a 30-mile drive to Barnard Castle he says was to test his eyesight after a suspected bout of Covid-19, on his wife's birthday.Mr Johnson had insisted his aide in ""every respect acted legally, responsibly and with integrity"", and has staked his own reputation on Mr Cummings' job, as well as that of many in his Cabinet.Both the prime minister and his aide have blamed the media for stoking public anger, despite at least 44 Tory MPs calling for his resignation and one minister, Douglas Ross, resigning himself in protest.Scientific adviser Professor Stephen Richer told Wired he hoped the public would use the Cummings story as an example of what not to do, while his fellow Sage subcommittee member Professor Susan Michie urged ministers to rebuild public trust by communicating honestly and openly.",Newspaper; Web Publication
241,Coronavirus: NHS and social care staff set to get antibody tests from next week;The announcement -expected in full later today -is poised to be the first wide-scale rollout of a test to show if you've had coronavirus in the past,"May 21, 2020 Thursday",International,mirror.co.uk,404,404,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,"By, Dan Bloom",Coronavirus: NHS and social care staff set to get antibody tests from next weekThe announcement -expected in full later today -is poised to be the first wide-scale rollout of a test to show if you've had coronavirus in the past,"NHS and social care staff will start being given ""game-changing"" antibody tests as early as next week, the government is expected to announce today.Health Secretary Matt Hancock is poised to unveil the nation's first wide-scale rollout of a test to show if people have already had Covid-19.According to the Guardian, the tests will be offered to ""hundreds of thousands"" of NHS and social care staff from next week.It's understood an announcement was due to be made at tonight's Downing Street press conference.However, it is still unclear how many staff will actually receive a test in the first few days.And it is still too early to know if those who've had Covid-19 have full immunity, or how long that immunity might last.Instead, the tests are -at least at first -set to be used mainly for research purposes and to build up a wider picture of the spread of Covid-19.Unlike the current ""swab"" tests, which show if you currently have the virus, the antibody blood test would show if you had Covid-19 in the past. Current estimates are having to rely on comparisons of people who currently had coronavirus at any one time. Latest figures today suggest 137,000 people in England, outside hospitals in care homes, had coronavirus at some point between May 4-17.That's one in 400 -0.25% of the community.Until recently there was no accurate antibody test to show people who've had the virus months ago.But the government has been negotiating to buy millions of ""100% accurate"" tests from Swiss firm Roche.An announcement on the progress of the deal is expected at tonight's press conference.Separately, Superdrug are also rolling out an antibody test that claims to have 97.5% accuracy.But the government's own scientific advisors have warned it is too early to link the test to immunity.And even if it is linked, there are problems with rolling out immunity certificates or ""passports"" to get people back to work.In a paper on April 13, the scientific pandemic influenza group on behaviour SPI-B warned rogue bosses could give riskier jobs to people who have had Covid-19.They said employers might ""actively discriminate"" against workers who were not shown to have antibodies.And any 'immunity passports' -which have not yet been proven to work -could be hijacked by people trying to ""game the system"".The experts also warned even a small margin for error could lead to large numbers thinking they're immune when they're not.",Newspaper; Web Publication

243,"In private, Tories were dismayed. In public, they rallied to save Dominic Cummings;Pressure is growing inside and outside parliament for the resignation of the No 10 chief adviser after claims that he flouted lockdown rules","May 23, 2020 Saturday",International,The Observer (London),1957,1957,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,"Toby Helm, Robin McKie, Michael Savage and Mark Townsend","In private, Tories were dismayed. In public, they rallied to save Dominic CummingsPressure is growing inside and outside parliament for the resignation of the No 10 chief adviser after claims that he flouted lockdown rules","It was Mother's Day - 22 March - and as Covid-19 spread across the country, Boris Johnson was urging families not to mark the occasion as normal. ""This Mothering Sunday,"" he said, ""the single best present we can give - we who owe our mothers so much - is to spare them the risk of catching a dangerous disease. The sad news is that that means staying away. This time the best thing is to ring her, video-call her or Skype her - but avoid any unnecessary physical contact or proximity.""The following day Johnson imposed a full lockdown on the country. Pubs and restaurants had to close. Johnson banned all but essential travel. The message was crystal clear, and was repeated day after day by government ministers. It was to stay at home wherever possible, however painful and difficult doing so might seem.For weeks beforehand, those suffering symptoms of coronavirus had been ordered to self-isolate, as had anyone with whom they had come into contact. The police had been given powers to impose fines on those flouting the rules. Adults up and down the country stayed away from their parents and grandparents, however old and vulnerable they were. Lockdown was a national sacrifice that had to be made - by everyone.Yet some time the following weekend - 28/29 March - Johnson's closest adviser Dominic Cummings, his wife Mary Wakefield, a journalist who was already suffering from Covid-19 symptoms, and their young child, drove more than 250 miles from their London home to the farm where Cummings's parents live near Durham. Over that weekend Cummings also developed symptoms and became very ill.Without revealing their location and that they had ever left London, Wakefield would later give an account of her husband's Covid-19 experience in an article for the Spectator. ""Dom couldn't get out of bed. Day in, day out for 10 days he lay doggo with a high fever and spasms."" Cummings wrote of his illness too saying: ""At the end of March and for the first two weeks of April I was ill, so we were both shut in together."" Wakefield recalled that when they had both shaken off the virus ""we emerged from quarantine into the almost comical uncertainty of London lockdown"" - a statement her readers could have been forgiven for thinking meant they had never left the capital at all.Late on Friday evening, however, people learned otherwise when the Guardian and Daily Mirror jointly broke the story of the Cummings family's trip north at the height of the lockdown. Durham police said they were made aware that Cummings had travelled from London and was in the area on 31 March. In a statement last night they said: ""At the request of Mr Cummings's father, an officer made contact the following morning by telephone.""During that conversation, Mr Cummings's father confirmed that his son had travelled with his family from London to the North-East and was self-isolating in part of the property.""Durham Constabulary deemed that no further action was required. However, the officer did provide advice in relation to security issues.""A neighbour told the papers of the sighting. ""I got the shock of my life, as I looked over to the gates and saw him. I recognised Dominic Cummings - he's a very distinctive figure.""Similar examples of public officials flouting lockdown guidelines have led to swift resignations with senior Conservatives leading choruses of condemnation. When Professor Neil Ferguson, the leading epidemiologist, quit as a member of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) after admitting he had been visited by his girlfriend, the health secretary, Matt Hancock, said he was ""speechless"" and made much of his willingness to help the police with any inquiries they might make.But this time if Conservative ministers, MPs and No 10 staff were shocked they tried their damnedest not to show it. They took time marshalling defensive lines to save the most powerful and feared man in Whitehall, after Johnson himself. For 14 hours after the revelations caused a storm on social media the government machine seemed stunned into silence. Only a few ""friends"" of Cummings tried to fight back with anonymous comments. Cummings himself can normally spin his way quickly out of the tightest of corners but even he was slow to react.By mid-morning on Saturday, however, as calls grew from opposition MPs for him to quit, No 10 began its fightback. No, he would not resign under any circumstances. In fact the message was more that what Cummings had done deserved respect, and was well within the rules. Officials highlighted a part of government lockdown advice which said people could leave home in exceptional circumstances including to ""provide care or help for a vulnerable person"" - while failing to mention all the other parts which suggested they should have stayed put with their child. The evolving defensive argument was that Cummings's child had needed to be cared for as the parents were suffering or about to suffer from Covid-19.With Labour demanding an urgent statement and clarity, the cabinet suddenly began to sing with one voice and rallied round Johnson's man. Minister for the Cabinet Office Michael Gove, who used to employ Cummings and defends him at every turn, spoke out suggesting those who questioned the controversial adviser were the unthoughtful ones: ""Caring for your wife and child is not a crime,"" he said. Fellow senior cabinet colleagues, the foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, and the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, also weighed in in harmony. ""Taking care of your wife and young child is justifiable and reasonable, trying to score political points over it isn't,"" Sunak tweeted.The script was now decided and No 10 issued a statement saying: ""Owing to his wife being infected with suspected coronavirus and the high likelihood that he would himself become unwell, it was essential for Dominic Cummings to ensure his young child could be properly cared for.""His sister and nieces had volunteered to help so he went to a house near to but separate from his extended family in case their help was needed.""His sister shopped for the family and left everything outside.""At no stage was he or his family spoken to by the police about this matter, as is being reported.""His actions were in line with coronavirus guidelines. Mr Cummings believes he behaved reasonably and legally.""But privately many Tory MPs and ministers were dismayed. The police, while cautious in public, were in private clearly furious. Scientists were incredulous and civil servants confided fears that Cummings was completely out of control. One senior mandarin said the cabinet secretary Mark Sedwill should investigate whether Cummings had breached the civil service code by so clearly going against the spirit of government policy, at a time of and on a matter of, national emergency. ""Someone should be asking if Cummings's behaviour was consistent with the civil service code, and if not what are they going to do about it?"" said the civil servant.Durham's acting police and crime commissioner, Steve White, whose force's account of events was being challenged by No 10,said: ""Given the whole ethos of the guidance and regulations issued from the government was to reduce the spread, regardless of reason, by travelling to County Durham when known to be infected was most unwise.""University College London professor Susan Michie, a member of Sage, told Sky News there was no question that what Cummings had done broke the guidance. ""It appears that three rules have been broken. One is leaving the house when you're symptomatic, another is travelling far distances and staying overnight elsewhere, and the third is having a person - in this case a child - go from one household to another household. The problem about having different rules for different people is that it breaks the trust of the people in those who are issuing the guidelines.""Dean Burnett of Cardiff University took a similar view. ""What Dominic Cummings did was utterly reckless. He knew he could have been infected with Covid-19, yet he drove more than 200 miles to his parents' house. They are in their 70s, the most vulnerable group. It is utterly bewildering.""This is a man who is on the Sage committee and who is influencing government policy on Covid-19 and he behaves like this. It is unacceptable. He should resign.""Burnett added that his own father had died of Covid-19 but he had still respected the rules of lockdown. ""I could not comfort my father as he died and have had to grieve for him on my own. Like the rest of my family, I respected the rules of lockdown. Yet the man who has had key influence in setting up those rules seems to be quite happy to ignore them when it suits him. It is infuriating.""In an attempt to turn the heat on to Johnson himself Labour also demanded to know who in Downing Street had known about Cummings's progress to the north, after officials said several people in No 10 had been aware he had left London, though none had said so before yesterday.Last night as new claims emerged in the Observer about further sightings of Cummings in different locations near Durham, it is clear the prime minister and Tory ministers are united in trying to defend him and keep him in post come what may.But while it would be a humiliation and a severe embarrassment for Johnson to lose Cummings, there are big dangers in keeping him too. This weekend the police are trying to manage expected bank holiday crowds at a time when many people already believe the lockdown is effectively over. They are in danger of losing the battle as their authority has been undermined.Asked whether Cummings's actions would make the work of officers harder, Dorset crime commissioner Martyn Underhill said: ""I'm sure inevitably it will be today, because this is a breaking story and he is a very high-profile person. It is very unfortunate the timing of this, because this is going to be the busiest weekend Dorset's seen this year in a policing sense and a tourist sense.""More broadly there is a prospect that the whole episode will erode trust in the government, which is already on the slide, and lead people simply to ignore rules they see being flouted or bent by those at the top.In the latest Opinium poll for the Observer this weekend, the political dangers for Boris Johnson are clear. For the first time since the Covid-19 crisis began Labour leader Keir Starmer has a higher approval rating than the prime minister for his handling of the pandemic. Some 47% of people approve of Starmer's leadership against 45% who back Johnson's. The government's net approval rating (when the percentage that disapprove is subtracted from the percentage that approves) has fallen from +42% on 26 March to -4% now.The government has opted to try to stand by Cummings. But as it faces the increasingly difficult challenge of attempting to ease the lockdown with more nuanced and complex messages, it will need the public's support to do so.Nick Baines, the bishop of Leeds, told the Observer that if there was seen to be one rule for those in power and another for the rest then the trust on which leadership depends would be lost.""People across the country have sacrificed hugely in order to obey both the spirit and word of government advice. People have missed being with family members who have died,"" he said. ""But now we learn that there is one rule for the people and another for No 10 and the elite. Ministers have clearly been told to tweet support for Cummings. What price conscience? Or integrity? Or credibility? Or competence at a time when leadership can only be rooted in trust?""In a crisis such as the one the country is currently enduring, the last thing any government wants is to no longer be believed by the people it represents.",Newspaper

Roche's test has been proved to be 100% accurate, according to Public Health England.Professor John Newton, the national coordinator of the UK Coronavirus Testing Programme, told the paper: ""Last week, scientific experts at PHE Porton Down carried out an independent evaluation of the new Roche SARS-CoV-2 serology assay in record time, concluding that it is a highly specific assay with specificity of 100 per cent.""This is a very positive development, because such a highly specific antibody test is a very reliable marker of past infection.""Health Minister Edward Argar confirmed the test ""appears to be extremely reliable"" and ministers want it on stream ""as swiftly as we can"".Discussions with Roche are still taking place over mass-buying test kits for use in the UK. Only kits for the validation process are available so far.He told BBC Breakfast: ""We're not in a position yet to roll it out to the public and have those tests ready to go.""A Department of Health and Social Care spokesman said: ""Antibody testing is an important part of our strategy to counter the spread of COVID-19 and to help us understand who has had the disease.""In addition to the recent huge expansion of the UK's swab-based coronavirus testing capacity, we are exploring the use of antibody testing across the NHS and ultimately the wider public.""We are delighted that devices are progressing through validation, and are actively working on our plans for rolling out antibody testing and will make announcements in due course.""

245,"Public baffled by victory messages, claims adviser","May 14, 2020 Thursday",International,The Times (London),306,306,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,Tom Whipple; James Shield,"Public baffled by victory messages, claims adviser","No 10's decision to frame the partial easing of the lockdown as a victory to coincide with VE Day was ""incredibly unhelpful"", according to one of the government's scientific advisers.Steve Reicher, professor of social psychology at the University of St Andrews, and a member of Spi-B, the government's advisory group on behaviour, said that people were now justifiably confused about coronavirus messages. He said that the way Boris Johnson's announcement on Sunday night was described in briefings to the press had led people to believe that a major change was coming, when in fact it was nothing of the sort.""It's not that we are at the end, or near the end, of this pandemic. We are probably 10-15 per cent through the history of Covid-19,"" he told today's Stories of Our Times, The Times' podcast. ""What is happening is that we are changing strategy. We're not relaxing, we're not easing. We're certainly not ending, and we don't have a victory.""Mr Johnson's address shifted the government's slogan from ""stay at home, protect the NHS, save lives"" to ""stay alert, control the virus, save lives"". Professor Reicher said that the sign of a good message was that people understood it, and that in this case polling clearly showed it had failed.""All the headlines which tied the virus to VE day and talked about victory at the end of lockdown [gave] the impression that people could just relax, rush out and mob each other.

What is an antibody test                   As the name suggests, an antibody test looks for antibodies in your blood, which your body makes when it fights an infection.The test doesn't check for the virus itself, but looks to see whether your immune system has already responded to the infection.                     How does the coronavirus antibody test work                   The test requires a blood sample, which is analysed for antibodies to SARS-CoV-2.Roche explained: ""Through a blood sample, the test, which is based on an in-solution double-antigen sandwich format, can detect antibodies to the new coronavirus causing COVID-19, which could signal whether a person has already been infected and potentially developed immunity to the virus.""                     How long does it take to get results                   Roche's coronavirus antibody test is fully automated, and can provide results within minutes.It explained: ""These fully automated systems can provide SARS-CoV-2 test results in approximately 18 minutes for one single test, with a test throughput of up to 300 tests/hour, depending on the analyser.""                     How accurate are the tests                   Roche's test has been proved to be 100% accurate.Professor John Newton, the national coordinator of the UK Coronavirus Testing Programme, told The Telegraph: ""Last week, scientific experts at PHE Porton Down carried out an independent evaluation of the new Roche SARS-CoV-2 serology assay in record time, concluding that it is a highly specific assay with specificity of 100 per cent.""This is a very positive development, because such a highly specific antibody test is a very reliable marker of past infection.""                     How can the tests help in the fight against the coronavirus pandemic                   The production of an antibody test which reliably works is seen as crucial in the struggle against the coronavirus outbreak.The scientific consensus is that people who produce antibodies after catching the coronavirus may develop immunity to the disease.Health Minister Edward Argar suggested the test could be used to send people with ""immunity"" back to work.That is despite the government's own scientists warning we do not know how many people get immunity, how strongly, or for how long.Mr Argar told BBC Breakfast: ""It will make a big difference. Although the science is not 100% settled at the moment, the science is indicating that if you've had the disease you have a degree of immunity from either getting it again or passing it on.""The degree of that immunity is still being scientifically debated.""But what that means is if you have that level of immunity, it can genuinely change how you can work because you can go back to work knowing that you will not get it again and you will not be a risk to others.""If antibody tests can be rolled out on a mass scale, then the Government may be able to launch an immunity passport scheme allowing people to be freed from restrictions on an individual basis.However, the government's own scientific advisors have raised a huge list of problems with the idea of immunity certificates or passports.In a paper on April 13, the scientific pandemic influenza group on behaviour SPI-B warned rogue bosses could give riskier jobs to people who have had Covid-19.They said employers might ""actively discriminate"" against workers who were not shown to have antibodies.And any 'immunity passports' -which have not yet been proven to work -could be hijacked by people trying to ""game the system"".DR HILARY WARNS BREAKTHROUGH COVID-19 ANTIBODY TEST WILL NOT CONFIRM IMMUNITY                     When can you get one                   Unfortunately, it remains unclear when the antibody tests will become available in the UK, and how they will be rolled out.Roche says it is working closely with the NHS and UK government to enable a 'phased rollout of the test as soon as possible.'The pharmaceutical company also said it would be able to provide hundreds of thousands of tests to the UK per week.Health Minister Edward Argar told BBC Breakfast: ""We're not in a position yet to roll it out to the public and have those tests ready to go.""",Newspaper; Web Publication

Evidence produced by the Scientific Advisory Group on Emergencies highlights the wider damage being caused to young people by the halt to their education.Although they admit there is no certainty, a raft of papers suggest that children are less likely to be infected and infectious than adults, and teachers do not seem at heightened risk. The documents, prepared in the weeks up to May 1, float the idea of splitting classes in half and having children attend schools alternate weeks, saying that could slash the effect on the coronavirus 'R' number. Ministers hope publishing the documents will reassure the public about plans to start reopening schools from June 1. But unions insisted the SAGE evidence was 'inconclusive' and demanded delay. Downing Street also effectively conceded that many schools will opt not to bring back reception, year one and year six as Boris Johnson has suggested. The PM's spokesman said they would 'trust' headteachers to make decisions about how to proceed. Tory MPs are increasingly turning on Education Secretary Gavin Williamson over his handling of the situation. One told MailOnline he should have been laying the ground with the unions for weeks as they were known to be 'very belligerent and very left-wing'. 'Gavin is screwing up. There has been a huge eff up here,' the senior MP said.'Boris didn't just bounce him into it in 24 hours.'[related]Leading Cambridge University expert says risk for children catching COVID-19 is 'unbelievably low'  The risk of children catching coronavirus is 'unbelievably low', according to one of the UK's top experts.Eminent statistician Sir David Spiegelhalter said data has also shown that teachers do not have a greater risk of becoming infected. The University of Cambridge professor's testimony comes amid an explosive row over the reopening of schools next month.Professor Spiegelhalter pointed out that just one out of 7million children aged four to 14 in England and Wales has died from COVID-19.He also claimed children carry just a fraction of the viral load compared to adults, which significantly reduces their ability to fall ill or infect others.Professor Spiegelhalter told the BBC: 'There have been, based on the data so far, extremely low risks to children. Out of 7million five to 14-year-olds in England and Wales, so far the number of death certificates revealed with Covid on it is one.'There will be more [that haven't been confirmed], but there is still an extremely low risk. Of course we must remember this group of kids are staggeringly safe in general, less than one in 10,000 die every year. Nobody's ever been safer in the history of humanity than this group of kids.'Professor Spiegelhalter said that at least one child had died from a rare inflammatory illness linked to coronavirus, but reassured parents that the risk of the complication would now be 'much lower now the epidemic in the community is under control.'Asked about whether teachers and parents were being put at risk by schools reopening, the Cambridge professor said data suggested not.He added: 'The Office for National Statistics analysed Covid risks by occupation - some have higher risks, including bus drivers and care home workers.' But teachers were not included in this category, he said. 'Of course people are anxious about the rest of the family, but in healthy young parents aged between 20 and 40, there have only been about 30 death so far out of 30,000 who don't have existing conditions. 'There's about a three in a million chance of risk of death. That's a measurable risk, but in a sense it's a manageable risk... it's not overwhelming at all.' Speaking at the Downing Street briefing this evening, Chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance said reopening schools was likely to push the R rate up.But he stressed that was the case for any change to lockdown, and schools were 'not a high risk area for R'. He said coronavirus was a 'long term epidemic' and 'schools have to get back for education for our young people at some point' Sir Patrick said: 'The risk for children (from coronavirus) is much lower - we know that.'They are at low risk but not zero risk and there have been some serious cases of children, of course, but very few compared to adults and older age groups.'The broader risk in terms of opening schools is that as soon as you introduce any contact, you put pressure on the R and you put pressure on numbers, and that's true of anything we are going to do in terms of changes to contact.'He also delivered a shot across the bows of the government by noting that having test in trace in place was important when you were modifying lockdown. Many of the concerns about schools returning appear to be over the knock-on impact on social distancing, with more mixing of families and parents returning to work. A paper produced for a SAGE subgroup on schools for April 16 warns that 'a cohort of children have experienced a shock to their education which will persist and affect their educational and work outcomes for the rest of their lives'.'Similarly, the current lockdown may lead to an increase in adverse childhood experiences... for example: domestic violence, poor parental mental health,child neglect or abuse.'The report, prepared by experts from University College London, King's College London, the London School of Hygeine and Tropical Medicine, and the University of Exeter, said such experiences were 'associated with worse long-term health outcomes, and will likely exacerbate existing societal inequalities (eg. across deprivation)'. The group said it 'cannot be clear' the extent to which schools can be reopened without fuelling the virus.Although the risk to pupils going back to school was 'very, very small' it was 'not zero'.An assessment of various models of the impact of changes on the R rate shows the impact, on a scale of zero to one, would be 0.24 if classes were split and attended alternate weeks.If half the class went in in the morning and half in the afternoon that would rise to 0.4. The maximum impact of one would be if schools came back completely.A document from a behavioural insight meeting on May 1 said: 'Although not initially one of the options proposed by DfE, options 7b (classes split in two, with children attending on alternate weeks) emerged from the joint discussions as having particular potential merit for further consideration.' The findings will likely add to arguments with unions over whether it is safe for children to return, and if it can be achieved without triggering another flare up of the virus.The files emerged as a SAGE source claimed Government plans to reopen primary schools are grounded in welfare concerns rather than evidence younger pupils are less vulnerable. In the first phase of his back-to-school blueprint, Boris Johnson wants children in England in reception, Year 1 and Year 6 to go back to class on June 1.However, the exact shape of the reopening is being left in the hands of headteachers.Teaching unions have been threatening to boycott the move over safety fears, while a slew of councils have said they will not fall into line. Nicola Sturgeon has said schools in Scotland will not reopen until August, after the usual summer holiday north of the border.According to the SAGE papers, evidence on how likely children are to transmit Covid-19 remains 'inconclusive'.Wider contextual issues - including whether families have black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) members - must be taken into account when assessing the impact of relaxing school closures on transmission.Teachers do not appear to be at a greater risk of catching Covid-19 than other professions - but there is still some risk.Key points from the SAGE documents on school reopening •Evidence on how likely children are to contract and transmit Covid-19 remains 'inconclusive'.•Wider contextual issues - including whether families have black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) members - must be taken into account when assessing the impact of relaxing school closures on transmission.•Teachers do not appear to be at a greater risk of catching Covid-19 than other professions - but there is still some risk.•The Sage papers suggest that younger teachers' attendance in schools could be prioritised in order to decrease the likelihood of infection for school staff in more vulnerable groups.•The documents float the idea of splitting classes in half and having children attend schools alternate weeks, saying that could slash the effect on the coronavirus 'R' number.•A paper produced for a SAGE subgroup on schools for April 16 warns that 'a cohort of children have experienced a shock to their education which will persist and affect their educational and work outcomes for the rest of their lives'.The Sage papers suggest that younger teachers' attendance in schools could be prioritised in order to decrease the likelihood of infection for school staff in more vulnerable groups.The publication of the advice comes after education unions and council leaders called for the evidence underpinning the proposal to reopen schools in England to be released.'Evidence remains inconclusive on both the susceptibility and infectivity of children, but the balance of evidence suggests that both may be lower than in adults,' one paper said. Joint Secretary of the National Education Union (NEU) Dr Mary Bousted claimed the SAGE evidence showed the planned return was 'too soon'.'We think it's just descending into chaos now and it's not funny,' she told Sky News.'The evidence is still not there, we now have the Independent Sage Committee saying give it two weeks then we'll have half as much chance of catching the virus.' Dr Bousted added in a statement: 'This points to a cavalier attitude towards the nation's children.'The fact of the matter is that Sage has only weak evidence as to what extent children can transmit the virus to others... 'If we cannot be certain about the transmission of the virus - and it appears Sage cannot, either - then it is only right to exercise caution.' Meanwhile, a separate study has found children have half the chance of catching coronavirus as adults. University College London researchers analysed 6,000 studies looking into the link between the viral disease and children.They found the risk of catching COVID-19 in children and teenagers was 56 per cent lower compared to adults over 20. The scientists say their findings imply children are likely to play a lesser role in transmission of the disease because fewer of them get infected in the first place. Lead author Professor Russell Viner told a press conference ahead of the paper's publication today that the results show the 'balance of risks for children is strongly towards a return to school'.The UCL team are the latest experts to throw their support behind Boris Johnson amid a furious row about English schools restarting in June.Eminent statistician Sir David Spiegelhalter, from Cambridge University, also claims the risk for children catching COVID-19 is 'unbelievably low'.Yet the PMhas faced ferocious backlash from parents and teaching unions for his plan to get children in reception, year 1 and year 6 back to school on June 1.Scores of councils have refused to reopen amid fears pupils will spread the virus between each other, their teachers teachers and families. In the largest study of its kind, UCL scientists analysed 6,000 international scientific papers looking into children's susceptibility to infection and severity of illness. Of them, just 18 were found to be of high enough quality to be considered in their analysis - half of which had not been peer-reviewed (scrutinised by other scientists). Nine were contact-tracing studies, where researchers tracked close contacts of diagnosed patients.Eight were population-screening studies, whereby random samples of society were tested for the virus.And one was a systematic review of small household clusters, where entire families had been infected.The analysis - yet to be published in a journal - showed that children and young people had 56 per cent lower odds of catching SARS-CoV-2 from an infected person, compared with adults over 20) Researchers did not have sufficient data to examine whether children under 12 differed to teenagers in susceptibility.Under-18s also appear to account for just one in 10 family clusters of the viral disease, although this was based on just one study so the evidence is weak. While children appear less likely to catch the virus from others, once they are infected researchers remain uncertain about how likely children are to pass it on.Lead author Russell Viner, professor of adolescent health at UCL, said: 'There is an increasing amount of data now available on children and COVID-19, and this is the first comprehensive study to carefully review and summarise what we do and do not know about susceptibility and transmission.'Our findings show children and young people appear 56 per cent less likely to contract COVID-19 from infected others. 'Susceptibility is a key part of the chain of infection, and this supports the view that children are likely to play a smaller role in transmitting the virus and proliferating the pandemic, although considerable uncertainty remains.'This new data provides essential evidence to governments around the world to inform their decision-making on whether to reopen schools and reduce or end lockdown measures.' Co-author Dr Rosalind Eggo, an infectious disease modeller at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said: 'It [the study] suggests that children and young people are at lower risk of infection than adults and may therefore play a smaller role in the epidemic as a whole. 'This new evidence will help us better understand the possible effect of school reopening on transmission in schools and in the community.' It comes after a report by the 'Independent SAGE' committee claimed it is not safe to reopen schools on June 1.Sir David King - who chairs the 'Independent SAGE' committee and was Tony Blair's Chief Scientific Adviser when he was prime minister - said it is 'too soon' for children to return.His alternative SAGE committee of experts says delaying schools reopening for two weeks would allow for the Government's 'test, trace and isolate' programme, including its delayed app, to be established. In the first phase of his back-to-school blueprint, Boris Johnson wants children in Reception, Year 1 and Year 6 to go back to class on June 1.An expert on Downing Street's scientific advisory subcommittee on schools claimed that these specific year groups were selected based on worries for their education and wellbeing - not that they are more shielded to the disease. Although age is a factor in how at-risk an infected person is to Covid-19 symptoms, modelling found there was 'no increased risk to one year group over another'.The revelations that there is no difference in the vulnerability of certain year groups will likely whip up anger from teachers' unions, who claim social distancing is much harder to enforce in primary schools.",Web Publication

Asked whether the R rate was ""at best, a guess"", he replied: ""It's an estimate. It's based on all sorts of data sources, all of which are imperfect, and you try to put them all together to get the best idea.""What we need to focus on is improving the data streams. We need to get data much quicker on the number of people infected...that will allow us to have a much more precise idea of what's happening and that we can calibrate the public health response so that we can keep it under control.""A number of scientists on the Sage committee believe that the slow rollout of mass testing has left the UK unable to effectively monitor the spread of Covid-19, it is understood.Sir Patrick Vallance, the chief scientific adviser, said last month of Sage discussions: ""The weaker the evidence, and the more controversial it is, the more heated and prolonged the discussions are, and the more opinion becomes the dominant feature.""Meanwhile, a censorship row between scientific advisers and the government prompted a major U-turn.Scientists had accused ministers of ""Stalinist"" behaviour after key advice guiding the virus response was redacted from a report released to the public.One member of the Government's SPI-B advisory committee, Stephen Reicher, a professor of social psychology at the University of St Andrews, wrote on social media: ""The greatest asset we have in this crisis is the trust and adherence of the public.""You want trust? You need to be open with people. This isn't open. It is reminiscent of Stalinist Russia. Not a good look.""Yesterday, the documents were released in full, revealing that some experts had advised the Government not to impose heavy fines on people who broke lockdown rules.A Government spokesman said: ""Sir Patrick Vallance and No10 agree that such Sage documents relating to Covid should be published in full, in the interests of maximum transparency, with exceptions only for matters relating to national security.""",Newspaper
249,Independent SAGE' claims children have more chance of dying of coronavirus than a road traffic accident if they are sent to school on June 1,"May 22, 2020 Friday",International,MailOnline,3415,3415,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,"Martin Robinson, Chief Reporter For Mailonline",Independent SAGE' claims children have more chance of dying of coronavirus than a road traffic accident if they are sent to school on June 1,"•PM wants children in Reception, Year 1 and Year 6 to go back to class on June 1•Sir David King, who was Tony Blair's CMA, says date should be 2 weeks later•Unions have urged Government to dump the June 1 date once and for all•Gavin Williamson will today publish evidence in favour of school reopening•SAGE source says plan based on welfare not that pupils are less prone to risk                     Primary school children who return to school on June 1 are more likely to die from coronavirus than being killed in a car crash, a committee of scientists led by Tony Blair's Chief Scientific Adviser said today.The 'Independent SAGE' committee's report called 'Should Schools Reopen?', published this afternoon, says the 'extremely unlikely' risk of death from Covid-19 then tips back the other way if children are kept at home until September. Sir David King, who chairs the group of scientists gathered to challenge the Government's own experts, said today it is 'too soon' for children to return and claims 'new modelling' found the risk to children of catching the illness would be halved even if it was delayed for another fortnight.Sir David and his team say they have calculated the risk of death and infection for primary school children based on the Government's own data on coronavirus' spread in the UK and the infection rate among under-10s. The report says: 'Staying at home at all time points is about half as risky as going to school. Schools reopening in September present a slightly lower risk and reopening in June a slightly higher risk to a child than the background risk of a road traffic accident'. The daily chance of being killed in a road traffic accident is about 0.07 per million people in the UK. The coronavirus death rate among children on June 1 is predicted to be slightly higher at 0.23 per million, dropping to 0.02 on September 1. The new research, released on the day Government SAGE papers said evidence on how likely children are to transmit Covid-19 remains 'inconclusive', also claims: •A child who head back to school on June 1 has a 4% of being exposed to Covid-19 and a 1.4% chance of actually becoming ill. The percentages are slashed by at least half if a child stays at home.•On June 15 a child at school then sees the chance of being exposed to the virus drop to 2% with a 0.72% chance of becoming ill.•By September 1 the same risks drop to 0.49% and 0.15% respectively;                     Splitting classes in half and having them attend schools alternate weeks could slash the effect on coronavirus 'R' number                    Splitting classes in half and having them attend schools alternate weeks could slash the effect on the coronavirus 'R' number, government experts believe.Evidence considered by the Scientific Advisory Group on Emergencies (SAGE) suggests the impact on the spread of the disease be a fraction would be dramatically smaller if pupils come back part time.A raft of documents released this afternoon also suggest that children are less likely to be infected and infectious than adults.Many of the concerns about schools returning appear to be over the knock-on impact on social distancing, with more mixing of families and parents returning to work.An assessment of various models of the impact of changes on the R rate shows the impact, on a scale of zero to one, would be 0.24 if classes were split and attended alternate weeks.If half the class went in in the morning and half in the afternoon that would rise to 0.4. The maximum impact of one would be if schools came back completely.A document from a behavioural insight meeting on May 1 said: 'Although not initially one of the options proposed by DfE, options 7b (classes split in two, with children attending on alternate weeks) emerged from the joint discussions as having particular potential merit for further consideration.'The findings will likely add to arguments with unions over whether it is safe for children to return, and if it can be achieved without triggering another flare up of the virus.The files emerged as a SAGE source claimed Government plans to reopen primary schools are grounded in welfare concerns rather than evidence younger pupils are less vulnerable.Sir David spoke out as teaching unions urged the Government to dump the June 1 date and more than 2,200 schools prepared to defy Boris Johnson's plans. The group did, however, have concerns that children who miss school 'do not get the benefit of having face-to-face learning and seeing their friends'.They have suggested opening socially distanced 'catch up' classes held for children over the summer, run by up to 750,000 volunteers, held at 'sports grounds, football, rugby and other stadia' across the country.His alternative SAGE committee of experts says delaying schools reopening for two weeks would allow for the Government's 'test, trace and isolate' programme, including its delayed app, to be established. Paul Whiteman, general secretary of school leaders' union NAHT, said: 'Support for a fixed date for school return is vanishing quickly. What is needed now is local flexibility to determine when it is right for schools to open up to more pupils, informed by evidence of what is happening in their own local area'.And a source on the Government's SAGE committee has also claimed that plans to reopen primary schools are grounded in welfare concerns - including a lack of education for underprivileged children, rather than clear evidence that younger pupils are less vulnerable to coronavirus. Today it was revealed that two thirds of councils have now told parents they cannot guarantee that primary schools will open on time - while the Times Education Supplement reported this morning that some academies who previously backed the June 1 time have performed a U-turn.Only around 20 of England's 150 local authorities have said they are advising headteachers to open again in ten days' time, it was revealed today.Education Secretary Gavin Williamson has promised that scientific evidence in favour of school reopening will be published today - but it appears he is fighting a losing battle. A BBC survey of councils found that of the 99 that responded, 68 'cannot guarantee' parents their children will be back in school at the start of June.15 of those local authorities, mainly Labour councils in the north-west of England, said they had advised to opposed Boris Johnson's plans. 11 said they were still considering their response with just over a week to go and 53 said headteachers could decide. In the first phase of his back-to-school blueprint, Boris Johnson wants children in Reception, Year 1 and Year 6 to go back to class on June 1.An expert on Downing Street's scientific advisory subcommittee on schools claimed that these specific year groups were selected based on worries for their education and wellbeing - not that they are more shielded to the disease. Although age is a factor in how at-risk an infected person is to Covid-19 symptoms, modelling found there was 'no increased risk to one year group over another'.The Sage source told the Telegraph that 'welfare reasons and educational reasons' informed the decision to pick these three year groups as the first to go back.Sage, the Scientific Advisory Group on Emergencies, chaired by Sir Patrick Vallance, will today publish its advice on the safety of reopening primary schools next month. The revelations that there is no difference in the vulnerability of certain year groups will likely whip up anger from teachers' unions, who claim social distancing is much harder to enforce in primary schools.                     Boost for schools reopening as biggest study of its kind finds children are 56% less likely to catch coronavirus than adults                   Children have half the chance of catching coronavirus as adults, leading British scientists have found. University College London researchers analysed 18 studies looking into the link between the viral disease and children. They found the risk of catching COVID-19 in children and teenagers was 56 per cent lower compared to adults over 20.The scientists say their findings imply children are likely to play a lesser role in transmission of the disease because fewer of them get infected in the first place.

Ministers have also come under growing pressure from councils, predominantly by Labour-run local authorities in the north of England, who have ruled out a wider reopening from June 1. A final decision on whether to go ahead with reopening schools is expected to be taken by the government on or before May 28 after the most up-to-date scientific evidence has been reviewed. The Prime Minister's official spokesman said: 'We are continuing to hold discussions with them and to listen to their concerns.' He added: 'It remains our intention to get as many children as possible back into school as soon as we are able, in a way that's safe.' Asked when a decision would be made on the date, the spokesman told reporters: 'I'm not in a position to say to you, definitively, when we will be able to say that.'But 'our intention remains to get as many children into school as soon as possible but in a safe way'.It is likely that local authority-run primary schools in England will look closely at what their council has to say before deciding whether to reopen on the first week of June. The government has also said secondary schools and colleges should aim to offer some 'face-to-face contact' with Year 10 and 12 students who have key exams next year during the summer term.Teachers say they are trying to create a virus-free environment ahead of their schools' partial reopening next month.Charlotte Bayazian, head teacher at La Petite Ecole Bilingue in North London, can be seen rearranging tables to ensure her young pupils can socially distance while learning.Fully masked up, she was also seen (in other photos) covering displays in plastic and marking specific seating plans to prepare for the return of the bilingual school.The government's proposed recommencing of teaching for all Reception, Year 1 and Year 6 classes in England has met resistance from unions and councils, who claim it is still unsafe to return. The union opposing the reopening of schools has written to every head in England warning they face legal action if teachers catch coronavirus.The National Education Union (NEU) said schools could be pursued through the courts as its ups its campaign against the Government's plan to get children back in classrooms from June 1.It comes as the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies releases its safety advice today on reopening schools, which informed the Government's decision. Union critics said the report would 'remove all their excuses' for blocking reopening.NEU boss Kevin Courtney has instructed members to obstruct heads by accusing them of violating the law and 'threatening' to denounce them on social media.Letters have been sent to every school in England claiming the decision to reopen is on their 'shoulders', claiming they could be liable if teachers catch Covid-19 in their schools. 'We will be advising members of their legal rights should any member contract Covid-19 upon returning to school,' the letter warns heads and college leaders.But it was denounced by school leaders, who said it was 'not helpful'. Signed off by the NEU, GMB, Unison, and Unite, it claimed schools that follow Government guidance could be pursued in the courts.                     Social workers deployed in schools                   Social workers will be placed in schools across the country to help identify children at risk of abuse and neglect, the Government has announced.Nearly £10million of funding from the Department for Education (DfE) has been announced for projects aimed at boosting the educational outcomes of vulnerable children and keeping them safe from harm.Of this package, £6.5million will be allocated to What Works for Children's Social Care who will deploy social workers in more than 150 schools to help staff spot the signs of children at risk more quickly.Education Secretary Gavin Williamson said: 'The stark reality is that too many children are growing up at risk of abuse, neglect and exploitation. 'These are the most vulnerable in society, and the ones that most need our help. 'Schools Week reported that the letter said: 'We believe it is important you fully understand the potential liability you are exposing yourself to by following the current deeply flawed guidance.' It also claimed the Department for Education (DfE) 'failed to provide clear and robust guidance that will ensure the health and safety of pupils, staff and the wider community'.Government sources expressed outrage at the missive, saying guidance was informed by Public Health England. A DfE spokesman said: 'The welfare of children and staff has been at the heart of all decision making.'A NEU spokesman said: 'We will advise our members of their legal rights not to work if exposed to serious and imminent danger.' Prince William has warned of the impact that lockdown and being kept away from school could be having on children's mental health.In a video call to care providers, he said he was particularly concerned about the issue, despite families attempting to 'muddle' their way through.He also expressed fears about their anxiety levels as a result of the pandemic generally, as well as the loss of family members to the virus, and highlighted the long-term implications of the economic outlook for school leavers.The prince was talking to five professionals from the Belfast Health and Social Care Trust in a Zoom video call.William said: 'I'm particularly worried as to how the young people are going to cope long term because we're all muddling through this period.'But the long-term implications - of school being missed, anxiety levels, family members sadly dying and the sort of general economic outlook - do you think that will play heavily on your services and what they'll need?'How do plans to re-open state, academy and private schools differ across the UK? Schools, colleges and nurseries across the UK closed more than eight weeks ago due to the coronavirus outbreak, remaining open only for vulnerable pupils and the children of key workers.Boris Johnson unveiled proposals to allow more children in Reception, Year 1 and Year 6 to return to school in England from as early as June 1 as part of his strategy for easing lockdown restrictions.But the devolved administrations in Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales have adopted different approaches to sending children back to the classroom.So what are the plans for the different nations?- ScotlandThe Scottish Government aims to have all children back in schools on a part-time basis on August 11.Teachers will return to school during June to prepare for the attendance of pupils, while there will be support where available for pupils moving into primary 1 or moving from primary to secondary school.Education Secretary John Swinney said parts of the school estate could be expanded to allow social distancing to be observed, and community and leisure centres, conference halls and libraries could be used to allow pupils to spend more time with teachers.Schools will reopen towards the end of the summer holidays in Scotland, but children will return to a 'blended model of part-time in-school and part-time at-home learning' to allow for social distancing.- Northern IrelandAll children are intended to restart classes on a phased basis, involving a mixture of physical attendance and remote learning, in September if enough progress is made in curbing coronavirus.But the education minister has said schools in Northern Ireland could reopen to pupils preparing for exams in the third week of August.Those studying for major public tests and transfer from primary to post-primary schools would be among the first to return to classes under an envisaged phased reopening, Peter Weir said.Exams for entrance to post-primary schools are due to be held two weeks later this autumn to allow more time for primary teachers to catch up on lost lesson time since the school closures.- WalesThe Welsh Government has not given any dates for when the country can expect schools to reopen.Wales' plan to exit the lockdown sets out that restrictions will be eased through three stages - red, amber and green - and each of the stages will see a 'cautious' lifting of measures.If the virus remains under control, the amber zone would follow and include allowing priority groups of pupils to return to school. Further control of the virus would move the country into the green zone, allowing all education to resume.Education minister Kirsty Williams said she would refuse to set an 'arbitrary date' for a return to schools, saying the Government first needed to see more evidence about the disease.- EnglandThe Government expects pre-school children to be able to return to early years settings, and for Reception, Year 1 and Year 6 pupils to be back in school, from the start of next month.Young children could start returning to nurseries and primary schools in England from June 1, with the Government aiming for all primary school pupils to go back for a month before the summer holidays.The Government has also said secondary schools and colleges should aim to offer some 'face-to-face contact' with Year 10 and 12 students who have key exams next year during the summer term.A final decision on whether to go ahead with reopening schools is expected to be taken by the Government on or before May 28 after the most up-to-date scientific evidence has been reviewed.Are there different approaches to reopening among schools in England?- Council-run schoolsMinisters have came under growing pressure from councils, predominantly by Labour-run local authorities in the north of England, who have ruled out a wider reopening from June 1.It is likely that local authority-run primary schools in England will look closely at what their council has to say before deciding whether to reopen on the first week of June.A number of councils, alongside teaching unions, have been calling for the scientific evidence underpinning the decision to reopen schools in England to be published. This is expected on Friday.- AcademiesAcademies, which are state schools that are not run by councils, could follow the advice of their local authority, or they may make their own decisions on whether to stick to the Government's time scale.But already a number of chief executives of academy chains have said schools must reopen soon to avoid 'irreparable' damage to vulnerable children.Steve Chalke, founder of the Oasis Trust, which has 35 primary schools, said the trust plans to admit more pupils to its schools from June 1 as he said it is 'common sense' to create an opportunity for pupils to return to school.Sir Steve Lancashire, chief executive of REAch2, the largest primary academy chain in England, also plans to open all their schools for the priority year groups.- Private schoolsSome private schools may consider keeping children in Year 6 at home when schools reopen more widely, an independent school chief has suggested.Christopher King, chief executive of the Independent Association of Prep Schools (Iaps), which has more than 600 members, said he expects the vast majority of members in England to reopen to more pupils from June 1.But he told the PA news agency that some private schools may decide to remain closed to Year 6 pupils who can continue their virtual learning at home.Mr King also warned that it may be difficult for some independent schools to open if they are located in local authorities advising against a June 1 reopening.",Web Publication
250,Keir Starmer reveals his children have attended school throughout the coronavirus crisis as he calls for classes to resume 'as soon as possible',"May 23, 2020 Saturday",International,MailOnline,1594,1594,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,Alexander Robertson For Mailonline,Keir Starmer reveals his children have attended school throughout the coronavirus crisis as he calls for classes to resume 'as soon as possible',"•Sir Keir Starmer said his own children were still attending school in north London•Both required to go to classes in Camden as their mother Victoria works for NHS•Sir Keir said he hoped schools could return on June 1 but added it must 'be safe'•Called for Boris Johnson to reach a 'consensus' with teaching unions over returnSir Keir Starmer has urged primary schools to reopen in England as soon as possible as he revealed that his own children have attended lessons throughout lockdown.The Labour leader said his 11-year-old son and nine-year-old daughter were still going to state school in north London as his wife Victoria is an NHS key worker. He said he hoped children across England would be able to return to school next month but added that ""its got to be safe"".It comes as British teaching unions on Friday urged the government to reconsider its plans to reopen schools for younger pupils in the week starting June 1.However Sir Keir said it was important for Prime Minister Boris Johnson and those resisting the reopening, led by the hardline National Education Union, to reach a consensus on how to get pupils back in the classroom. Speaking on the Telegraph's Chopper's Politics podcast, Sir Keir said: 'Our children have been in school throughout [the lockdown] and it's a reminder that this perception that schools are shut at the moment and the question of whether we open them is wrong.'They're open at the moment, teachers, staff are on the frontline, every day. The question is, can we increase the numbers of children going back into school, and I want that to happen as soon as it can. But of course it's got to be safe.'Sir Keir added: 'The task of the Prime Minister is to build consensus, to give people confidence. Most of the polling I've seen... show that parents are about 50/50, they're genuinely worried... Rather than accentuating the differences here, the Prime Minister should pull a task force together, and say ""right, we are going to lead from the front"".'Sir Keir's comments came on the day that a major review found children were half as likely as adults to catch Covid-19, with lead scientists saying the results pointed ""strongly towards a return to school"".Researchers at University College London found that under-20s were 56 per cent less likely to contract coronavirus, concluding that ""children are the safest group to be out in the community"". Mr Johnson wants primaries in England in Reception, Year 1 and Year 6 to go back to class from a week on Monday, with others to follow in a ""phased"" restart.But it has sparked concern among some teachers and parents, as the death rate in Britain, at more than 36,000 already the highest in Europe, keeps rising by hundreds each day. Mr Johnson said this week he had 'growing confidence' that a tracing scheme would be in place by June 1, but there remain questions over whether this is possible.Several local authorities in England have said they were unlikely to be able to reopen schools by the start of next month.Education is a devolved matter for the governments in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Yesterday the government's SAGE experts warned the 'shock' of school closures are blighting a generation and suggested children are at low danger from coronavirus. Evidence produced by the Scientific Advisory Group on Emergencies highlights the wider damage being caused to young people by the halt to their education. The documents float the idea of splitting classes in half and having children attend schools alternate weeks, saying that could slash the effect on the 'R' number. Ministers hope publishing the documents will reassure the public about plans to start reopening schools from June 1. But teaching unions insisted the SAGE evidence was 'inconclusive' and demanded delay. Speaking at the Downing Street briefing this evening, Chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance said reopening schools was likely to push the R rate up.But he stressed that was the case for any change to lockdown, and schools were 'not a high risk area for R'. He said coronavirus was a 'long term epidemic' and 'schools have to get back for education for our young people at some point'                      Leading Cambridge University expert says risk for children catching COVID-19 is 'unbelievably low'                    The risk of children catching coronavirus is 'unbelievably low', according to one of the UK's top experts.Eminent statistician Sir David Spiegelhalter said data has also shown that teachers do not have a greater risk of becoming infected. The University of Cambridge professor's testimony comes amid an explosive row over the reopening of schools next month.Professor Spiegelhalter pointed out that just one out of 7million children aged four to 14 in England and Wales has died from COVID-19.He also claimed children carry just a fraction of the viral load compared to adults, which significantly reduces their ability to fall ill or infect others.Professor Spiegelhalter told the BBC: 'There have been, based on the data so far, extremely low risks to children. Out of 7million five to 14-year-olds in England and Wales, so far the number of death certificates revealed with Covid on it is one.'There will be more [that haven't been confirmed], but there is still an extremely low risk. Of course we must remember this group of kids are staggeringly safe in general, less than one in 10,000 die every year. Nobody's ever been safer in the history of humanity than this group of kids.'Professor Spiegelhalter said that at least one child had died from a rare inflammatory illness linked to coronavirus, but reassured parents that the risk of the complication would now be 'much lower now the epidemic in the community is under control.'Asked about whether teachers and parents were being put at risk by schools reopening, the Cambridge professor said data suggested not.He added: 'The Office for National Statistics analysed Covid risks by occupation - some have higher risks, including bus drivers and care home workers.' But teachers were not included in this category, he said. 'Of course people are anxious about the rest of the family, but in healthy young parents aged between 20 and 40, there have only been about 30 death so far out of 30,000 who don't have existing conditions. 'There's about a three in a million chance of risk of death. That's a measurable risk, but in a sense it's a manageable risk... it's not overwhelming at all.' Sir Patrick said: 'The risk for children (from coronavirus) is much lower - we know that.'They are at low risk but not zero risk and there have been some serious cases of children, of course, but very few compared to adults and older age groups.'The broader risk in terms of opening schools is that as soon as you introduce any contact, you put pressure on the R and you put pressure on numbers, and that's true of anything we are going to do in terms of changes to contact.'He also delivered a shot across the bows of the government by noting that having test in trace in place was important when you were modifying lockdown. Many of the concerns about schools returning appear to be over the knock-on impact on social distancing, with more mixing of families and parents returning to work. A paper produced for a SAGE subgroup on schools for April 16 warns that 'a cohort of children have experienced a shock to their education which will persist and affect their educational and work outcomes for the rest of their lives'.'Similarly, the current lockdown may lead to an increase in adverse childhood experiences... for example: domestic violence, poor parental mental health,child neglect or abuse.'The report, prepared by experts from University College London, King's College London, the London School of Hygeine and Tropical Medicine, and the University of Exeter, said such experiences were 'associated with worse long-term health outcomes, and will likely exacerbate existing societal inequalities (eg. across deprivation)'. The group said it 'cannot be clear' the extent to which schools can be reopened without fuelling the virus.Although the risk to pupils going back to school was 'very, very small' it was 'not zero'.An assessment of various models of the impact of changes on the R rate shows the impact, on a scale of zero to one, would be 0.24 if classes were split and attended alternate weeks.If half the class went in in the morning and half in the afternoon that would rise to 0.4. The maximum impact of one would be if schools came back completely.A document from a behavioural insight meeting on May 1 said: 'Although not initially one of the options proposed by DfE, options 7b (classes split in two, with children attending on alternate weeks) emerged from the joint discussions as having particular potential merit for further consideration.' The findings will likely add to arguments with unions over whether it is safe for children to return, and if it can be achieved without triggering another flare up of the virus.The files emerged as a SAGE source claimed Government plans to reopen primary schools are grounded in welfare concerns rather than evidence younger pupils are less vulnerable. In the first phase of his back-to-school blueprint, Boris Johnson wants children in England in reception, Year 1 and Year 6 to go back to class on June 1.However, the exact shape of the reopening is being left in the hands of headteachers.Teaching unions have been threatening to boycott the move over safety fears, while a slew of councils have said they will not fall into line.",Web Publication
251,"The Cummings debacle has exposed Boris Johnson's weakness and dependency;The prime minister is entirely unfit for the responsibility of his office. In cleaving to his special adviser, he looks the servant not the master","May 26, 2020 Tuesday",International,The Guardian (London),1114,1114,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,Polly Toynbee,"The Cummings debacle has exposed Boris Johnson's weakness and dependencyThe prime minister is entirely unfit for the responsibility of his office. In cleaving to his special adviser, he looks the servant not the master","Out of the dark side emerged the power behind the throne. Can the supreme disrupter do humility? Can he grovel an apology in front of those he most despises?No regrets, not sorry, but he tried a kind of plea for pity. The Cummings family plainly had a bad time, but his words may fall on stony hearts among other families who had also the virus, but obeyed the stay-at-home order without travelling 260 miles. The vast majority didn't seek out loopholes, but kept the ""stay at home"" rule in word and spirit. Did the Cummings have no friend in London? Who would take a 30-mile drive to a beauty spot, risking wife and child, as an            eye test ?Everyone wants to interpret the orders their own way but, as someone who sits on the science advisory group (Sage) and as No 10 director of strategy, he makes the rules. Never were these so crystal clear as when lockdown slammed the shutters.Behind front doors people suffered in solitary confinement. The single mother with the disabled child, the cancer patient barred from their children, aged grandparents in care homes who never saw families again. Most heartrending was the 13-year-old boy dying all alone because his parents obeyed the rules to stay away.Everywhere lonely deaths and lonely funerals are seared deep in everyone's thoughts, alongside tales of heroic health and care staff sacrificing their lives, and local groups helping others. Everyone is touched by this national calamity, which will yet leave more pain in its            economic wake with so many jobless, with careers blighted, hopes dashed.Just as well this Thursday will be last the clap-for-carers as the public mood risks turning angry: clap the heroes but beat your saucepans at scoundrels who tell us to do what they say, not what they do. The prime minister's defence of Dominic Cummings' rule-flouting is no Westminster bubble brouhaha, but it drives right to the heart of voters' lived experience. Typhoid Dom and Mary escaped London at peak infection, within talking distance of parents while others pined for family. By clinging on, both Cummings and his leader expose an alienation from public sentiment, after nine weary weeks of isolation with so much grief and ruin. But they have opted to take on a flock of bishops, police, medics, scientists and a flotilla of Tory MPs whose inboxes overflow with public indignation. Any minister would have been rapidly expelled. This is no mere storm in a Westminster bubble: illegally shutting down parliament and lying to the Queen did Boris Johnson no harm in the election because few voters felt personally prorogued. But this is personal.For as long as Cummings stays, Johnson is damaged, burning through political credit when he has very little to spare, sliding in polls that show 52% of voters calling for Cummings to go, only 28% to stay. We know Johnson to be a man without loyalty - not to friend, lover or family, faithful only to himself. So why is Cummings indispensable?This exposes the weakness and dependency of a prime minister who is only an empty frontman, entirely unfit and unwilling to shoulder the job's heavy lifting, relying dangerously on a svengali who has persuaded him of his genius. But as long as Johnson cleaves to him, he looks the servant not the master.Look what else looms as a flurry of devastating analyses of Johnson's mishandling of the epidemic emerges, even from his Tory press. As infections doubled every three days there were ""38 days when Britain sleepwalked into disaster"", the            Sunday Times found, excoriating a lockdown delay that ""cost thousands of lives"". Blithely Johnson ordered ""business a usual"", boasting in true Trumpian style on 2 March that Britain was ""            very, very well prepared "", with ""fantastic testing systems"" and ""amazing surveillance of the spread of the disease"". Radio 4's            More or Less has just demolished the daily lies on testing. It has never been anywhere near 100,000 people a day - in fact, barely half that, once duplicate tests and non-tests are deducted.Cummings doesn't matter. What really matters is the damage done to trust in future official coronavirus messages. This week Johnson will relax the rules further, partly bowing to pressure from the impatient right wing of his party. Persuading people to stick to more complicated rules will be hard while gradually easing out of lockdown.I talked to an experienced contact tracer, now working on the Covid-19 track-and-trace scheme: she describes the chaos of its overcentralised non-functioning computerised system which will certainly not be up and running by next Monday, let alone fulfil Johnson's fatuous promise of a ""world-beating"" system.But here's what worries her most. She will be cold-calling people with no symptoms to order them to strictly home-isolate for 14 days, just as everyone else is easing up. If Cummings couldn't obey this, even with florid infection in his family, how much harder will it be to convince others not infected?""We know there are mountain ranges of surges ahead of us each time there's an easing of rules. We expect rises at the end of June, and the end of July, and just hope there's no second wave in the autumn or winter,"" she says. Freedom from lockdown means chasing down every new Covid-19 case, commanding rigid obedience from all they've contacted, even those who can barely remember meeting the infected person. By defending Cummings, Johnson has demolished a sense of moral obligation, undermining the public spirit that says ""I will if you will"". He has allowed us all to follow our ""instinct"", not the contact tracers' instructions.In a cry of despair, Prof Stephen Reicher, of the Sage behavioural insights subcommittee, says: ""Boris Johnson has trashed all the advice we have given on how to build trust and secure adherence to the measures necessary to control Covid-19."" A government with a majority of 80 is rock solid. But a Tory prime minister is never safe. Leaders in this ruthless party last only so long as they remain winners. After the outrage over her poll tax, even Margaret Thatcher fell under their undying lust for power. It's an impulse that keeps Conservatives in office most of the time - and one which Labour often lacks.The tens of thousands of lives needlessly lost during Johnson's cavalier handling of the epidemic will weigh heavily on his premiership from now on. Indulging one of his own to disobey rules that everyone else followed may linger long in public memories too. They will hope this blows away, but I suspect it will leave behind political scars - yet another signal that we are never ""all in this together"". Polly Toynbee is a Guardian columnist",Newspaper

Union leaders have accused Mr Johnson of sending mixed messages which could have 'lethal' consequences. The GMB's John Philips said: 'We need strict rules on hygiene and social distancing, enough PPE for everyone, and regulations employers can't just ignore if they fancy it.'

Amid concern that the latest slogan and what is meant by ""Stay Alert"" would cause confusion among the public No 10 were forced to issue a lengthy clarificationto the message.A No 10 spokesman said the public could stay alert by ""staying at home as much as possible"", ""limiting contact with other people"" and keeping two metres apart where possible.""We can control the virus by keeping the rate of infection (R) and the number of infections down,"" the spokesman said.This afternoon Boris Johnson tweeted an image of thenew slogan which included ways to stay alert. The image, which had the headline ""we can help control the virus if we all Stay Alert"", listed staying at home ""as much as possible,"" as well as working from home ""if you can"" and a call to ""limit contact with other people"" as ways to stay alert. It also instructed the public to ""keep your distance if you go out"" and ""wash your hands regularly"".

Ms Sturgeon later said the ""stay alert"" message was ""vague and imprecise"", compared to the previous message which was ""clear"".She asked that the new campaign was not deployed north of the border as she said it would be ""catastrophic"" to drop the ""stay at home"" advice. During this afternoon's Cobra meeting it is understood Ms Sturgeon accused Michael Gove of not giving the devolved nations the whole picture as she said the first she heard of ""the PM's new slogan"" was in newspaper reports.Mark Drakeford, Wales' First Minister, seconded Ms Sturgeon's response as he said ""staying at home remains the best way you can protect yourself and others,"" as he cautioned against ""fundamentally different rules because that is confusing for people and it makes the basic message harder to convey"". Northern Ireland's First Minister, Arlene Foster, also urged the region to stick with the ""stay home, save lives"" message.""On the whole, the message is to stay at home. We will say we are not deviating from the message at this time,"" she told BBC Northern Ireland radio. Jeane Freeman, the Scottish Health Secretary, added that the new slogan was ""not a change that we would agree with"". ""I think the First Minister was really clear last week that the 'stay at home' message was the right message and if I'm perfectly frank, I have no idea what 'stay alert' actually means,"" she told BBC's Politics Scotland.Ms Freeman said the population would be ""at a disadvantage"" when adhering to the guidance if communications from the Government were not clear.""We're asking the public to do a very great deal here and the least we can do is be consistent and clear in the message that we're sending and 'stay at home' is the right message,"" she said. Behavioural expert Professor Susan Michie, who is a member of the scientific advisory group for emergencies (Sage), said Mr Johnson's new messaging is ""a long way"" from being clear and consistent.""Dropping the 'stay at home' message from the main slogan in favour of generalised alertness may be taken as a green light by many to not stay at home and begin socialising with friends and other activities that increase the risk of transmission,"" she said. ""This could potentially undermine the good work over the last few weeks that has seen impressively sustained high levels of adherence by the public in what for many are very challenging situations.""However Robert Jenrick, the Communities Secretary, defended the ""broader"" slogan which he said was needed for the Government to restart the economy.""I think that's what the public want and that they will be able to understand this message, which is that we should be staying home as much as possible but when we do go to work and go about our business we need to remain vigilant, we need to stay alert,"" he told Sky's Sophy Ridge on Sunday. He later insisted that the Government was not ""going to take risks with the public"" but said ""we want now to have a message which encourages people to go to work"".Meanwhile Jonathan Ashworth, the shadow health secretary, urged the Prime Minister to provide ""clarity"" over what the new slogan means. ""There is no room for nuance in this, this virus exploits ambivalence, it thrives on ambiguity,"" he said.Mr Ashworth warned that people would be ""slightly puzzled, questioning what does it mean to stay alert, what are the government saying with that?"" ""I think the stay at home message is easily understood and that is the strength and beauty of that message,"" he said. It comes after large numbers of people were seen enjoying parks on Bank Holiday Friday, including a rise in road traffic and an increase in Coastguard call-outs, causing mounting concern people continue to flout the clear ""stay at home"" advice. Ed Davey, the acting leader of the Lib Dems, said by dropping the 'Stay at Home' slogan the Government had made the job of the police ""near impossible"". ""Ministers risk sowing confusion and losing public trust with this muddled communications strategy and lack of transparency,"" he said, as he called on ministers to publish the ""evidence they are relying on to make these decisions"".

It includes tests that were posted out. We're told 31,587 people have died. No they haven't. It's far more than that."" The professor, also chair of the Winton Centre for Risk and Evidence Communication at the University of Cambridge, continued: ""I think this is not a trustworthy communication of statistics. It's such a missed opportunity. There's a public out there who are broadly very supportive of the measures, they're hungry for details, for facts, for genuine information.""And yet they get fed this, what I call number theatre, which seems to be coordinated really much more by No 10's communications team, rather than genuinely trying to inform people about what's going on.""He added: ""I just wish the data was being brought together and presented by people who really knew its strength and limitations and could treat the audience with some respect.""When asked by Marr later on the programme whether, in response to the criticism, the government would rethink the way they present the numbers, communities secretary Robert Jenrick said: ""Well, I'm sure there's ways we can improve these press conferences. ""They continue to get large audiences, but they're designed to inform the public. If there are better ways of presenting the numbers - and I very strongly respect the professor - if we can do that, we should and will do that.""Ministers have cited the views of Professor Spiegelhalter a number of times during the pandemic. When questioned about the death toll by Labour leader Keir Starmer during prime minister's questions on Wednesday last week, Boris Johnson said: ""I would echo what we've heard from Professor David Spiegelhalter and others: that at this stage, I don't think that international comparisons and the data is yet there to draw all the conclusions that we want.""The message the government is putting out to the public on the pandemic has also been criticised by another member of Sage, behavioural expert Professor Susan Michie who said dropping the ""stay home"" slogan risked giving people the green light to socialise, jeopardising the gains made by the coronavirus lockdown in.Prof Michie said Mr Johnson's new messaging was ""a long way"" from being clear and consistent, adding: ""This could potentially undermine the good work over the last few weeks that has seen impressively sustained high levels of adherence by the public in what for many are very challenging situations.""It comes as the prime minister is expected to unveil a new colour-coded alert system as he eases some lockdown restrictions in Sunday night's daily briefing. It is thought he is going to drop the government's ""stay at home"" messaging in favour of ""stay alert"" - sparking further accusations of mixed messaging and immediate rejections from Scotland and Wales.",Newspaper; Web Publication

I'm interested that, today in France, they've gone for a slogan that is roughly the same sort of thing as our message, and it's the way to go."" It came as a You Gov survey found that only three in 10 Britons said they knew what ""Stay Alert, Control the Virus, Save Lives"" is asking them to do.Most Britons (91 per cent) said the previous slogan - ""Stay Home, Protect the NHS, Save Lives"" - made it clear what they were supposed to do, while just 30 per cent said they think they know what the new mantra means.On Sunday, before Mr Johnson gave his 7pm televised address to the nation, Ms Sturgeon condemned ditching the slogan that has brought the UK to an effective standstill since March 23.Revealing that she had not been informed about the change, she insisted the original guidance would remain in force in Scotland. Her Welsh and Northern Irish counterparts, Mr Drakeford and Arlene Foster, also indicated they would keep telling people to stay at home. Ms Sturgeon said the new catchphrase was ""vague and imprecise"" and added: ""I don't know what 'Stay Alert' means."" She warned that ""people will die unnecessarily"" if the progress made against coronavirus is ""squandered"" by ""easing up too soon or by sending mixed messages that result in people thinking it is OK to ease up now"".One of the Government's advisers, behavioural expert Professor Susan Michie, joined the criticism, saying the shift risked ""undermining the good work over the last few weeks"".In the face of the backlash, Mr Johnson posted a fuller version spelling out that people are still being urged to ""stay at home where possible"" and ""stay alert"" when they do go out.On Monday, Ian Blackford, the leader of the SNP in the Commons, questioned why Scotland had learned about the new ""Stay Alert"" message from The Telegraph.Mr Johnson insisted it was a ""valid piece of advice - indeed, so is stay at home if you can"". Liz Saville Roberts, the Plaid Cymru leader, said there was ""now a three nation approach"" and asked Mr Johnson to confirm that he is acting as the Prime Minister of England. He replied: ""I reject that completely,"" but added that there are differences in some areas because there are different 'R' rates, adding that different measures would be applied in different places ""locally, regionally and nationally"".",Newspaper; Web Publication

261,"We'll stick with our stay at home plea, says Sturgeon","May 11, 2020 Monday",International,The Times (London),500,500,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,Oliver Wright,"We'll stick with our stay at home plea, says Sturgeon","The leaders of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland rejected Boris Johnson's ""stay alert"" coronavirus advice last night, warning that it could jeopardise efforts to control the pandemic.The heads of the three devolved administrations said that they would not be changing their official ""stay at home"" guidance for at least three weeks and rejected plans to allow unlimited travel to parks and beaches from Wednesday.Downing Street said last night that people living near the Welsh border might not be allowed to travel into the country for exercise. The Welsh government is concerned that the easing of restrictions could result in a flood of visitors in the coming weeks.Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland's first minister, suggested that the stay-at-home advice would remain the same north of the border. After a Cobra meeting with the prime minister and devolved leaders, Ms Sturgeon told the government not to deploy the stay-alert message north of the border, warning the ""vague and imprecise"" slogan could be ""catastrophic"". She said she did not know what ""stay alert means"". ""Presumably we all live our lives in normal times staying alert to danger.""Mark Drakeford, first minister of Wales, told Sky's Sophy Ridge on Sunday that the stay-home message had ""not gone away"". ""The message I will be giving is while [people] must be alert to the danger of coronavirus, if you're not out of your house for an essential purpose - and that does include exercise, shopping and going to work for people who can safely do so - staying at home remains the best way [to] protect yourself and others,"" Mr Drakeford said.The Northern Ireland executive released a slogan telling residents to ""keep staying at home, keep protecting the NHS, keep protecting lives"". Arlene Foster, the first minister, made clear it would not be taking its lead from Westminster.Scientists also expressed their concern about the latest approach. Professor Dame Til Wykes, vice-dean of the Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience at King's College London, said: ""The one thing that helps the population is clear, concise and accurate messaging. This one is concise only. The previous message to stay home was at least clear. What does stay alert mean?"" Professor Susan Michie, a member of the scientific advisory group for emergencies (Sage), said that the new slogan was ""a long way from"" being clear and consistent.""Dropping the stay-at-home message from the main slogan in favour of generalised alertness may be taken as a green light by many to not stay at home and begin socialising with friends and other activities that increase the risk of transmission,"" she said.Robert Jenrick, the housing secretary, insisted that stay at home would remain an ""important part of the message"" in England. ""We want people to stay at home as much as possible.""Jonathan Ashworth , the shadow health secretary, called for Boris Johnson to give ""crystal-clear clarity"" on how the public must behave, saying the virus ""thrives on ambiguity"".",Newspaper

What the hell is 'stay alert' supposed to mean?"" she asked.The behavioural expert Professor Susan Michie, a member of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), said the slogan is ""a long way from"" being clear and consistent.

I am not sure how this answers that.""Jo Maugham of the Good Law Project said: ""'Stay alert' is the pandemic's 'Take back control'. Its meaninglessness is its very point. It permits each of us to act just as we desire. And allows Government later to deny permitting that which turns out to be bad [and] assert it urged that which turns out to be good.""",Newspaper
263,I went from being married and owning a home to sleeping rough for 10 years',"May 11, 2020",International,i - Independent Print Ltd,533,533,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,Vicky Spratt,I went from being married and owning a home to sleeping rough for 10 years',"The coronavirus pandemic has exposed Britain's growing homelessness crisis, with an estimated 165 per cent increase in rough sleeping over the past decade and the return of homeless people living in tents.The Government is putting money behind emergency measures to house homeless people in hotels, hostels and B&Bs in a housing-led attempt to prevent Covid-19's spread. But, imagine if a radical housing initiative could end homelessness once and for all, not just in a national emergency? There is. It's called Housing First and it's the reason why Barry Lockhart, a former borehole driller who was living on the streets until recently, is speaking from a one-bedroom maisonette in Hungerford, Berkshire, where he has lived since December. Mr Lockhart, 67, moved around for years, making bus shelters and benches his home.""Things happen. You are not working, you are drinking, and one thing leads to another,"" he explains. Mr Lockhart became homeless after the breakdown of his marriage. He had owned his home with his ex-wife and rented privately after they split but could not keep up with his rent.The Housing First scheme which helped him is operated by Sovereign - the largest housing association in the south of England - in partnership with Two Saints, a homelessness support group, and West Berkshire council. His rent is paid through universal credit to Sovereign his landlord. He has two support workers to assist him with repairs, paying rent, universal credit administration and physical or mental health issues.Sovereign is one of a handful of housing associations in England trying Housing First, which has been successful in Scotland.The premise is simple.Developed in Finland, where street homelessness has now been effectively eradicated in its capital Helsinki, the idea is you house homeless people immediately, regardless of their needs. There are no caveats - they are not told to stop drinking, using drugs or told to get a job - they are simply given a home and, simultaneously, given any treatment or social support needed to get back on their feet.The evidence from Finland and other countries which have adopted it, speaks for itself. In 2013, 97 per cent of the high-need homeless people using Housing First in Amsterdam were still in their homes after 12 months and in Glasgow, the Turning Point Housing First's rate was 92 per cent.Dr David Halpern writes in a book published by the Centre for Homelessness Impact: ""Housing first is one of the few interventions to have rigorous evidence behind it."" So, why hasn't it been rolled out nationally? Dr Halpern says it comes back to questions of ""costeffectiveness"" and the data just isn't quite there yet, allowing leaders to fall back on their outdated ideology that presents homelessness as the individuals' fault.While true that family or relationship breakdown can be a cause of homelessness, drink and drug use tend to be side effects. The single biggest cause of homelessness in England is actually the ending of private tenancy through eviction.Arguments against are often that it will cost those managing it money and rises in rent arrears or antisocial behaviour. Sovereign says this has not been the case for it.",Newspaper
264,"If the BBC picks a side, it will already have lost;Auntie should aspire to help the country become less polarised, not more","May 31, 2020 Sunday",International,The Sunday Times (London),1145,1145,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,Matthew Syed,"If the BBC picks a side, it will already have lostAuntie should aspire to help the country become less polarised, not more","The fabric of our political culture is unravelling. The serial editorialising of Emily Maitlis, the cronyism accusations against Robert Jenrick and the spat between Donald Trump and Twitter are merely symptoms of a malaise that future historians will look back on as posing a greater threat to open societies than anything conjured by Covid-19. The cracks are getting wider, the dangers more stark.Too often, we conceptualise the growing polarisation in western democracies as the consequence of echo chambers. The digital world has supposedly given citizens the opportunity to personalise their consumption of news, a bespoke information stream that has cut off alternative sources of ""facts"". These tendencies have supposedly been exacerbated by the algorithms that underpin Google search, which invisibly filter information to give us more of what we want to see.The consequence, the story goes, is two distinct ideological camps, one surrounded (in the American case) by Fox News and alt-right feeds, the other by the liberal New York Times, CNN and the left-wing precinct of Twitter. They hate each other because they are detached from one another. As the legal scholar Cass Sunstein put it: ""Though millions of people are using the internet to expand their horizons, many people are doing the opposite, creating a Daily Me that is specifically tailored to their own interests and prejudices.""This analysis is, I think, deeply mistaken.As far as I can tell, each side of the political divide is perfectly aware of what the other is saying, which is why you see so many piling into tweets with which they disagree. The internet is awash with diverse sources of information, making it almost impossible to avoid them. This is corroborated by research that shows, as one paper put it: ""Social networks and search engines are associated with an increase in an individual's exposure to material from the other side of the political spectrum."" Indeed, echo chambers were probably more real 40 years ago when people received news from the BBC and, at most, a single newspaper.No, the distinctive aspect of the digital age is not that political groups are isolated from one another, but what happens when they engage. According to Sunstein, this should lead to moderation. When people are exposed to the opinions of people with whom they disagree, they should see that political issues are often complex, with arguments on both sides. In fact, the opposite happens. The more the two sides engage, the more polarised they become. A study by Duke University in North Carolina recruited Twitter users to follow a bot that retweeted views from across the political spectrum. Far from becoming more balanced, users retreated ever deeper into their own prejudices.Or take the troubles of Ferguson, Missouri, in 2014, after Darren Wilson, a police officer, shot and killed a black man, Michael Brown. In an uncanny prelude to what is unfolding today in Minneapolis, the internet metastasized into two factions. One side was aghast at the shooting and condemned the police response, while the other side argued the officer was being scapegoated and the protesters were all looters. Engagement between the two sides did not lead to increased empathy or understanding, still less consensus over policy. Instead, it inflamed mutual hostility.The UK isn't yet as polarised as America, but distinct fringes increasingly dominate the online world. The alleged bullying by Priti Patel was seized upon by one side as evidence of her awful character and by the other as the reasonable actions of a determined woman. The decision of the Supreme Court on prorogation was seen by one side as principled, by the other as outrageous. Much of the noise around the government's response to Covid-19 has split down these lines, too. And, as in the case of America, the more that each side is exposed to the opinions of the other, the more they retreat towards alternative versions of reality. Dare I also mention Brexit? Look at Twitter and you will see this phenomenon unfolding in real time. Users no longer engage their brains to determine whether to retweet and thus amplify an opinion. Instead, they mindlessly retweet the flag-wavers of their side - whether Owen Jones and Carole Cadwalladr on the left or Tom Harwood and Darren Grimes on the right. Alternative views are not considered on merit but attacked in more or less ad hominem ways. These tendencies have been exacerbated by the rolling tyranny of 24-hour news where editors invite flag-wavers to do theBB equivalent of shout at each other across a crowded bar. They call it ""balance"". But these are not commentators in any meaningful sense; they are the creatures of polarisation, posting ever more inflammatory remarks to generate maximum amplification from their own side. They then confuse the popularity of the tweet with its cogency.A critical mass of British voters can see these fringes for what they are: relatively small ideological sects increasingly detached from empirical reality. Many people are not on Twitter (how I envy them), which is why they are flummoxed by the popularity of pundits whose views are so conspicuously prejudged. But we shouldn't be complacent. The distorting effect of the internet - the way that people coalesce into more or less cohesive groups, the way they develop a sense of identity by retweeting fellow insiders and demonstrate loyalty by needling outsiders - has contaminated our political culture. You only have to look at what is happening in America to see how polarisation, left unchecked, can destabilise a democracy.This is why the corrosion of the BBC's reputation for impartiality is of unusually grave importance. I happen often to agree with the editorial stance of Newsnight, but even I can see how its bias is wrecking the credibility of the entire institution. This isn't about the coverage of Dominic Cummings per se, but a slow-motion car crash that has been unfolding for months, its journalists making the tragic (but common) mistake of conflating the virality of its social media posts with the credibility of its analysis. This could yet destroy the BBC itself, turning a great organisation into a facet of polarisation rather than a bulwark against it.It isn't too late. A revitalised BBC is not an unrealistic hope, nor a vigorous free press that more adequately holds power to account. But perhaps the most important thing is a population with the capacity to detect ad hominem fallacies along with the other question-begging tropes of the digital world. Socrates argued that when citizens assess arguments on merit rather than through the prism of ideology, democracy flourishes. More than 2,000 years later, his words ring truer than ever.@MatthewSyedNewsnight makes the mistake of conflating the virality of its social media posts with the credibility of its analysis",Newspaper

Doctoroff, the CEO of Sidewalk Labs (a company held under Google's parent company Alphabet Inc.) said in a blog post that it will ""no longer pursue the Quayside project.""Doctoroff said the reason was due to the coronavirus pandemic, which he describes as ""unprecedented economic uncertainty [which] has set in around the world"". The project, which would have spanned 12 acres, apparently became ""too difficult"". This is after Google scaled back its original proposal, which would have developed 190 acres of property and was hotly contested by the development agency Waterfront Toronto.""I believe that the ideas we have developed over the last two-and-a-half years will represent a meaningful contribution to the work of tackling big urban problems, particularly in the areas of affordability and sustainability"" Doctoroff also said.                     The development between Google and Totonto to create the new town - named Quayside - was intended to be ""a blueprint for the 21st-century urban neighbourhood"". Innovations included retractable canopies, heated bike and pedestrian paths which would melt snow, and buildings that would ""block wind in winter but not during the summer"".However, many criticised Google's intentions in the project. US venture capitalist Roger McNamee said last year that: ""The smart city project on the Toronto waterfront is the most highly evolved version to date of ... surveillance capitalism"", and suggested that Google would use ""algorithms to nudge human behavior"" in ways to ""favor its business"".""No matter what Google is offering, the value to Toronto cannot possibly approach the value your city is giving up,"" he also wrote. ""It is a dystopian vision that has no place in a democratic society."" The year before Jim Balsillie, co-founder of the company behind BlackBerry, Research in Motion, said that the project was ""a colonizing experiment in surveillance capitalism attempting to bulldoze important urban, civic and political issues"".Sidewalk Labs had previously said that a ""data trust"" would be used, so that ""urban data"" collected would not be shared by third parties, and that it would use ""open standards for any digital infrastructure and services it provides""In a recent interview about the closure of the project John Tory, the mayor of Totonto, said that he was ""disappointed"" but that ""everyone acted in good faith"" even though the project ""got off to a bad start"".",Newspaper; Web Publication
