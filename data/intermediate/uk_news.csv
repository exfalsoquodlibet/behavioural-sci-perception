0,I'm the person Dominic Cummings is looking for - but I won't be applying,"January 23, 2020 Thursday",International,thetimes.co.uk,581,581,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,Leigh Caldwell,I'm the person Dominic Cummings is looking for - but I won't be applying,"Dominic Cummings started 2020 with a job ad containing an eccentric set of skills for shaking up government forecasting and decision-making. Is this pure disruption, or do those topics and technologies offer a clue to his plans?The keywords lay a very specific trail of breadcrumbs. Prediction science, cognitive technologies, Cialdini, Pearl's calculus of causation. Agent-based models, storytelling, the Neo4j database his programmers will use. What could this collection of buzzwords mean?I have a pretty good idea, because the expertise Dom wants is a near-perfect description of my work. But I'm unlikely to apply.For a decade I've used exactly this combination of mathematical, economic and computing disciplines to model the economy and the human imagination, giving me a distinctive insight into what Cummings might be up to. I believe he has two ambitious plans - but a critical third step is missing.The first is advanced data science. Finding cause-and-effect levers in huge datasets; approximating when perfect decisions aren't possible. Programming languages, machine learning: essential tools of modern life. Nothing wrong with the civil service getting better at that.The second step is less neutral. Agent-based models are a tool (which I endorse) for running computer simulations of society and testing new policies. Behavioural economics and persuasion technology can sell ideas to a sceptical population: this is what made Cummings famous.But ten years of doing this has taught me a third component is indispensable. It's absent from Silicon Valley's move-fast-break-things philosophy, and from Dom's blog post. The third element is values.For humans, values are our motivation to solve problems and a measure of whether we've succeeded. AI has motivations too. Nudge theory says 'there is no neutral choice architecture', and there is no neutral goal for an algorithm. If you don't give it values, it will inherit them by default.Programmers and economists (I've been both) prefer simple values. The greatest happiness for the greatest number: the perfect algorithmic principle? Until you start to ask: are UK-resident, taxpaying EU nationals included in ""the greatest number"", or only British citizens? If someone needs £30,000 for mobility support or cancer treatment, how is that weighed against the 30 people who'll give up £1,000 to provide it?Until we give values to machines, they can't apply the good judgement that is essential to policy design.Traditional economics seeks the best way for people to get what they want. Dom's ideas will optimise that process. The next step needs cognitive economics: the study of how our brains decide what we want, before we ask how to get it. We are just starting to answer that for humans, let alone AI.To give values to algorithms, we must agree on those values. That means democratic debate, not civil service rules. Only then can we let AI loose on running the country. Policy is not just an optimisation problem, it's a set of choices about the society we want to live in. And until Cummings - and his boss - have shown us what their values are, I'm not ready to help implement them.

1,"Can We Be Happier? by Richard Layard review - a breathless tribute to the ""science of happiness"";This hard sell from the former 'happiness tsar' may be a work of passion but it is slapdash, paternalistic and liable to cause some misery","January 23, 2020 Thursday",International,The Guardian (London),1289,1289,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,Richard Seymour,"Can We Be Happier? by Richard Layard review - a breathless tribute to the ""science of happiness""This hard sell from the former 'happiness tsar' may be a work of passion but it is slapdash, paternalistic and liable to cause some misery","Almost any product can be branded, in the wearisome idiom of advertising, a ""revolution"". So it is with the happiness industry which, in Richard Layard 's brash sales pitch, is both a ""happiness revolution"" and a ""world happiness movement"". This book is a long-form advertisement that brooks no dissent - a breathless tribute to the ""science of happiness"", encompassing ""mind-training"", cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), and behavioural economics. No one could be better placed to write this than New Labour's former ""happiness tsar"".It was Layard, as he reminds readers, who persuaded New Labour to offer CBT to depressed and anxious patients on the NHS. Despite a glut of studies challenging the efficacy of the treatment, he has lost none of his confidence in it. Indeed, far from engaging with the bad news, he now suggests it can treat everything from schizophrenia to domestic abusers. Neither the backlash against the happiness industry, nor questions about the integrity of mindfulness - a bowdlerisation of Buddhist meditation - are acknowledged, much less allowed to check his enthusiasm. The book approaches even its most cliched subjects, from 18th-century moral philosophy to New Age thought, with new-born astonishment.                     Can We Be Happier? is a work of passion, a culmination of decades of research. It groans with statistics, factoids and allusions to neuroscientific studies. It is extensively bullet-pointed, leavened with cartoons and laden with diagrams of the simplest points - lest the reader fail to grasp that Jane's behaviour can affect both her own happiness and that of others. It concludes with a blank square, slightly larger than a business card, inviting the reader to fill in ""My Personal Manifesto to Myself"". This book has exceedingly low expectations of its audience.The ""movement"" whose virtues it carols consists of ""enlightened teachers, managers, community workers and volunteers"" all working towards one key idea. Happiness, they agree, is the goal of every society. It can be measured and explained, and changed by policy. Societies must be judged by the happiness of their citizens, especially the least happy. Policy must be informed by this ""ethics of happiness"", and it must avail itself of ""the science of happiness"" and the emerging discipline of ""mind-training"". Crucially, economists should get ""actively involved"" in all areas of happiness and unhappiness because ""they have the right analytical tools for the job"". This is understandable, since Layard is an economist. It is, though, decreasingly apparent that economists have the right tools to analyse the economy, let alone feelings. And one wonders if this is really the moment for another exercise in the imperialism of economic reason.The founding dogma of this book is that happiness - and not, say, serving God, or enlightenment, or social revolution - is the goal of all human endeavour. Whatever is good makes people feel better in some way. This is alarmingly close to the economist's recursive reasoning wherein everything that is good adds ""utility"". The persuasiveness of such statements depends on no one unpacking exactly what ""utility"", or ""happiness"" for that matter, consists of. Yet Layard's expedient sweeping of big questions under the rhetorical rug gives rise to methodological incoherence. He relies on world happiness surveys as the basis of his data, and all the correlations and causal inferences he extrapolates. How can happiness be meaningfully measured across all countries, regions, classes, genders, religions and ethnicities, and always mean the same thing? Layard says that we can trust people's statements about their mental state because there is a ""good correlation"" between what they say, and ""objective measurements taken from the brain"". This, the footnote suggests, refers to a 1990 neuroscientific experiment by Richard Davidson: test subjects were shown short emotional films and the electrical activity in their brains measured. Yet this concerns not the background ""life satisfaction"" that Layard is trying to assess, but transitory emotional responses to a stimulus. It doesn't back up Layard's methodology. It just invokes, as the book often does, the irresistible authority of brain science.Layard is no less slapdash in drawing his inferences. Where he finds a correlation, he immediately infers causation. Findings show that a child's happiness is strongly correlated with which primary and secondary school she attends. The author concludes that teachers and classroom methods are the main drivers of childhood happiness. He does not entertain the alternative hypothesis that attendance at a specific school is correlated with other social factors giving rise to emotional problems, such as poverty. This approach becomes jarringly recursive. We are told that mental illness, defined as being diagnosed with depression or anxiety, is a strong cause of unhappiness. This is to say, suffering is caused by suffering. Layard goes further, asserting that mental illness is a bigger factor in unhappiness than low incomes. He declines to consider whether, mental illness being correlated with low incomes, poverty brings with it circumstances that make people unwell. By the time he is trumpeting the alleged successes of CBT, Layard's handling of the data is verging on propagandistic.What, though, is the hard sell in aid of? Politically, it seems, the answer is third way communitarianism. Layard rejects ""extreme liberalism"" in favour of ""reciprocal obligation"". The ""decline of deference"" may have gone too far, contributing to the rise of ""populism"". ""Healthy competition"" is ""healthy"" but not the ""be-all-and-end-all"". Redistribution is good, but ""the proportion of GNP which is raised in taxes has to be taken as given"" - no raising taxes on profits or wealth. The poor should be given services, not cash transfers, since ""people's choices are inefficient - they fail to choose what will in fact make them happiest"". Welfare should be workfare. The author celebrates his role in persuading New Labour to offer young people low-paying jobs on pain of losing benefits, as this would make them happier than the rut of dependence.One byproduct of the author's breezy confidence that ""we"" know what happiness is, and that it is what life is for, is thus a creeping paternalism. This extends from the workplace to the home. Layard is astonished to find that people are least happy in the company of the boss, and that work is among the least pleasurable things we can do. He blames the problem on management philosophy. Bosses should inspire, value and pursue employee wellbeing. They should be trained to notice and inquire about possible mental health issues. As though employees might not dread that conversation. Or worry about bosses extending their reach into what William Davies calls the ""surveillance, management and government of our feelings"". The obviously diverging interests of labour and capital are tellingly elided in this book. As to the potentially diverging interests of wives and husbands, the book genuinely suggests that not only can CBT solve marital grief, but it can also fix domestic abuse. The state, that is, should prescribe CBT to keep violently abusive relationships together. Much else in the book is humane, but this is verging on sinister.Lynne Segal has suggested that the ""happiness agenda"" ought to be named the ""misery agenda"". She reasons that it adapts citizens to the causes of their misery, rather than addressing them. This book seems determined to prove that point.

2,"The salary sweet spot that could save your relationship;As a poll reveals that many high earners have problems at home, Alex Holder asks how much money really equals happiness","January 23, 2020 Thursday",International,The Daily Telegraph (London),1136,1136,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,Alex Holder,"The salary sweet spot that could save your relationshipAs a poll reveals that many high earners have problems at home, Alex Holder asks how much money really equals happiness","Chances are the person driving that sleek, blacked-out Range Rover is in an unhappy marriage. In all probability, the person supping champagne in business class is considering separating from their partner. While society perpetuates the idea that rich people are happy people - that those sitting at the front of the plane or the head of the boardroom have perfect lives - a recent survey of 500 high-fliers found that more than two thirds of those earning £100,000 or more confessed to having ""significant"" problems in their private relationships.In comparison, only 20 per cent of the general population admit to similar issues with their partner. Out of those top earners surveyed - many of whom were business owners, board members and managing directors - 46 per cent blamed long working hours for their romantic troubles.We've all seen the studies. And we know that our health and relationships matter more to our wellbeing than our earnings. Yet most of us would find it difficult to say no to a pay rise, even when it's offered in tandem with a more stressful position that will inevitably keep us in the office for longer. We still think more money will make us happier, and don't stop to consider what the pursuit of it could cost us: the late nights, the time away from family, the anxiety that comes with responsibility, and never having time to book a doctor's appointment or schedule a date night.So what are the happiest people earning? Is there a salary sweet spot? Every year, the Office for National Statistics studies 200,000 British people with the aim of answering the question: ""What matters most to our life satisfaction?"" While their most recent study found that earning less than £400 per week increases the chances of being in the most miserable one per cent, they also found that once your basic needs and wants have been met, more money doesn't necessarily make you any happier. In fact, it can have the opposite effect.Paul Dolan, a professor of behavioural science and author of Happy Ever After, says that peak happiness can be found with earnings of £40,000 to £59,000 per year; after that it begins a downward trajectory.So why aren't high salaries having a positive trickle-down effect on the rest of our lives - especially our relationships? Take a moment to picture the richest person you know: are they sunning themselves by a pool or sitting at a desk? Are they chilled or stressed? Do they see their family and friends much? How often do they just go for a stroll? It used to be thought that money was the gateway to a life of leisure, but that's no longer the case - elite men in the US now work longer hours than poorer ones. Put simply, the pleasures that come from having loads of money are often depleted by the process of actually earning it. Rich people are essentially finding their happiness in negative equity.I recently spoke to a 40-year-old man in the middle of divorcing his highearning wife. When I asked why they were separating, he said her long hours in the office had meant, ""She never saved a smile for me.""Little wonder. The moment we get a pay rise is the moment many of us are offered more debt. People cite money as freedom, but when a salary is sustaining a mortgage, it can become more trapping than freeing.Recent research conducted by YouGov and First Direct, found that financial worries do not discriminate: anxiety over cash flow affects 48 per cent of UK adults irrespective of income, with 32 per cent of people struggling to sleep at night because they have money on their minds. And if there's anything guaranteed to affect your personal relationships, it's exhaustion.So how can we balance earning enough to give us security and some pleasures in life without inviting in the problems of earning too much, such as guilt because you never put your children to bed? Or the kind of stress that can really tear couples apart - especially if one half feels more burdened than the other when it comes to domestic life? The first step is understanding the concept of ""enough"". Helen Russell, the author of The Atlas of Happiness - a study of how different nations achieve bliss - says that other countries might be better at this than we Brits.""The Swedes have lagom - the idea of 'just enough' - that applies to life, work and pretty much everything, so earning more money is less of a priority for them than living a good life,"" she explains. ""The Danes have arbejdsglæde, from arbejde, the Danish for work, and glæde, from the word for happiness. It literally means 'happiness at work'; something that's hugely important in Denmark and means that a decent work-life balance is prioritised over a big pay cheque.""What we should take from this is that happiness isn't all about success, achievement and material things, but is found in contentment and peace… and a happy home life.In our society, things that aren't monetised are often underrated: pottering about, tidying up, spending time with children, or grandchildren, making someone you love a cup of tea, calling your parents. Spoiling yourself isn't always about putting your credit card down, sometimes it's about having time to water the plants or make a delicious cup of coffee.""When I earned six figures I would constantly buy new clothes because I didn't have time to wash the ones I had. I would take cabs everywhere and never had time to cook,"" says a former advertising executive who quit to spend more time at home.""Now that I earn less I can't afford to get a taxi or takeaway every night, but I've realised that cooking and walking and living at a slower pace actually make me happy.""Also key to leading a happier life is not buying into the cult of comparison. We no longer just measure our affluence by pitting our lives against those of our friends; now we compare ourselves with Hollywood celebrities.Of course, it's nice work if you can get it. Earning £50,000 - the apparent salary sweet spot - would put you into around the 90th percentile of earners in the UK. As Prof Dolan points out: ""For the vast majority of the population, earning more money should alleviate misery. This is an important point that is often overlooked by relatively wealthy academics and commentators who say more money doesn't matter.""Ain't that the truth? Acknowledging the results of these studies isn't about rejecting money and the power it has to transform our lives; perhaps the real takeaway is this: it's not a ""healthy salary"" if it comes at the expense of your health.Open Up: Why Talking About Money Will Change Your Life by Alex Holder (Serpent's Tail, £12.99).

3,Backlash grows over blueprint to protect children's data online;Information Commissioner,"January 23, 2020 Thursday",International,"Financial Times (London, England)",633,633,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,MADHUMITA MURGIA,Backlash grows over blueprint to protect children's data onlineInformation Commissioner,"The UK will introduce sweeping new regulations to protect children's data online, including in effect walling off swaths of the web to under-18s, despite widespread criticism from companies that operate online services.The rules, proposed by the Information Commissioner's Office, seek to limit practices that might harm children, such as location tracking, content personalisation and tailored behavioural ""nudges"" such as YouTube recommendations and targeted advertisements. Companies would need to either make all of their services ""childfriendly"" - by turning off default functions such as geolocation and personalisation - or ""age-gate"" their websites, requiring users to verify their age.The regulations, which could fundamentally reshape scores of online businesses, would apply to any company with online services that a child might use, ranging from ecommerce sites such as Asos to search engines, news sites and social media platforms, the ICO said.If implemented, they would carry the same potential penalties as the EU's General Data Protection Regulation - including a fine amounting to 4 per cent of global turnover.The UK has been one of the first movers in looking to safeguard children's privacy online. However, there are concerns the ICO's new regulations may bring in excessive constraints, while unfairly advantaging bigger companies.""The UK has been pioneering in relation to its protection of children on the internet, particularly its move toward protecting children's data online, which is very fresh,"" said Victoria Nash, deputy director of the Oxford Internet Institute and an expert on children's use of digital services.""However, my two concerns are that this wide-ranging regulation tends to increase monopoly power of big tech firms, rather than decrease it. The second is a slight residual concern that it focuses on specific features or tools [like geolocation], which aren't in themselves always problematic."" Ms Nash's concerns were echoed by tech representatives from large and small companies, whose objections ranged from the ICO's indiscriminate targeting of all online business, to its potential to strangle start-ups and its conflation of issues of inappropriate content with data protection.""[The new framework] was developed by the ICO to a tight deadline with less industry engagement than is normal for an initiative of this scope,"" said Antony Walker, deputy chief executive of TechUK, an industry group representing Google, Facebook, Amazon and others. ""In particular, we are concerned that it could lead to some unnecessary age-gating of online services.""Others working for digital start-ups worried the regulation was trying to solve the problem of harmful content through a broad-brush approach that would hit smaller companies.""This discussion started around how social media companies are acting, but it hits the whole digital economy. And you are actually going to drive traffic to the big tech companies that are financially able to build products that comply with this code,"" said a person close to the start-up industry, who did not wish to be named. ""The breadth of the code, the age verification issue, it's just a badly drawn piece of legislation.""In a draft of the regulation published in May, the ICO said it expected all companies to collect users' personal information in order to verify their age. However after a backlash, it has softened its stance, saying it will review the requirements for verification depending on the type of data being processed.Elizabeth Denham, the Information Commissioner, who was responsible for drafting the rules, said: ""There are laws to protect children in the real world: film ratings, car seats, age restrictions on drinking and smoking. We need our laws to protect children in the digital world too.""",Newspaper
4,Top universities 'not being chosen by low-income students';The disadvantaged with good A-levels more likely to pick lower-ranking institutions than richer pupils,"January 26, 2020 Sunday",International,The Observer (London),506,506,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,Jamie Doward,Top universities 'not being chosen by low-income students'The disadvantaged with good A-levels more likely to pick lower-ranking institutions than richer pupils,"Poorer students with good A-level grades are significantly more likely to opt for less prestigious universities than those with similar results from more advantaged backgrounds.This is the standout finding from major research that throws into question how effective higher education is in equalising opportunities.Successive governments have spent heavily to encourage disadvantaged students to go to university. The Office for Students in England recently set ambitious targets for wider access. But a team at the UCL Institute of Education saytheir research, published by the Centre for Economic Performance, throws into question whether simply getting poor students into university is enough.They examined the ""quality match"" between students and the courses they attend, using data on a cohort who enrolled in university in 2008. A student was considered well-matched if they had similar A-level scores to others on their course.They were deemed under-matched if they attended a course where fellow students had lower grades - suggesting they could have attended a more academically prestigious course; and over-matched if other students on the course had gained higher grades than they had.Courses were also ranked based on the average earnings of their graduates five years later. A student was considered well-matched if their course had a similar ranking to their individual ranking based on their A level results.The research reveals that almost a quarter (23%) of students were found to be under-matched and a similar proportion were over-matched. Significantly students from low socioeconomic backgrounds were more likely to be under-matched than those from rich backgrounds.""It could well be that students from disadvantaged backgrounds might not feel that they fit in at more prestigious places,"" said Gill Wyness, professor of economics, who led the research.She added that multiple factors could be at work. There has been speculation that poorer students might tend to pick the closest university to home to save money. But Wyness said the research suggested the picture was more complicated than that.""You're much more likely to go to your local university if you are from a poorer background. But if you look at all the students who go to a university that is near them, the disadvantaged kids will still go to a lower-quality university than the advantaged kids. Take London, for example, the rich kids will go to the Russell Group, they'll go to UCL, and the poorer kids will go to South Bank. Geography doesn't seem to be the driver of mismatch - the poorer students are still going to lower-quality universities.""Wyness said this suggested poorer students would benefit from more outreach work from high-ranking universities.She cited the example of No 10's behavioural insights team, also known as nudge unit, which conducted an experiment The team also found female students attended courses with lower future average earnings than men, something the researchers said had implications for closing the gender pay gap.",Newspaper
5,"A car-free future? How UK cities are moving towards a pedestrian age;With York announcing plans to ban private vehicles from its centre, Colin Drury asks: Is it a blueprint for a better urban life?","January 26, 2020 Sunday",International,The Independent (United Kingdom),996,996,England & Wales,Colin Drury,"A car-free future? How UK cities are moving towards a pedestrian ageWith York announcing plans to ban private vehicles from its centre, Colin Drury asks: Is it a blueprint for a better urban life?","Rush hour, York city centre, sometime around the end of the decade. Stress-free commuters glide by on bicycles, community gardens are tended by volunteers as they leave work, and early evening diners spill outside on to table-filled squares.Over in Fossgate, a mid-week street festival is just beginning. At the station, a line of on-demand driverless pods quickly and quietly whisk arriving rail passengers to their end destinations.Such any idylic vision is what this North Yorkshire city could look like if proposals approved by the council to make the centre car free by 2023 come to fruition. Or so say advocates.Others, including the chamber of commerce, are not entirely convinced. There are concerns that less vehicles could ultimately mean reduced footfall leading to a nosediving economy, struggling businesses and plummeting job opportunities.It is, in many ways, says one councillor, a fight for the heart and future of the city.Yet this is not a battle which will be confined to York over the next decade.As more calls are made for the country to reduce carbon emissions and congestion amid the ongoing climate crisis, the debate over the large-scale pedestrianisation of our urban centres is set to become one of the defining arguments of the 2020s.York is aiming to have a car-free city centre by 2023 (AFP/Getty)Already, Birmingham has announced an aspiration to stop private vehicles driving through its centre;            Sheffield,            Leeds and            Edinburgh have experimented with (albeit limited) car-free days; and            Bristol is to ban diesel vehicles next year. Already, too, opponents in all those places have voiced misgivings.All of which perhaps raises two questions.Can the UK city - an environment that has been designed almost entirely around the automobile for close to a century - really pivot to pedestrians and public transport? And what would car-free cities here look like anyway?A sprawling car park outside a sprawling shopping centre on the outskirts of Bristol is probably not the obvious place to find the answer to either of those questions.But at the Mall at Cribbs Causeway this week a team of developers, software engineers and transport academics were here hoping to offer a small glimpse into the future.They were road-testing a £5.6m driverless pod - the sort of electric sci-fi buggy some strategists hope could one day zip people around car-less city centres.But, as is the way of these things, not everything ran smoothly.After more than two years state-of-the-art development - radar, lidar and vision processing are all key - the buggy, called Capri, kept being rendered immobile by the, er, sun.                     Cars haven't been banned but the city has been remodelled bit-by-bit to discourage their use: almost 1,000 car parking spaces have been removed while previous arterial routes have become one-way or blocked altogether to all but buses, emergency vehicles and those with special permits. As in Groningen 40 years earlier, it has been made so cars are essentially the least efficient way to travel.""There was opposition when we started,"" says Marcussen. ""We had to say to those people that, I'm sorry, this is happening, it will not change. But work with us, let's have dialogue, and we will address your concerns.""Mainly, she says, it was businesses worried about footfall. In the event, it has gone up by 14 per cent in streets where work has been done. Biking now equates to seven per cent of all journeys made and public transport 29 per cent.""But we expect those figures to rise further as there is a cultural shift,"" she adds.Certainly, residents appear to have bought into the scheme: at the 2019 city elections, the Greens, which have driven the change as part of the council's ruling coalition, doubled their number of seats.What is her advice for UK cities hoping to achieve something similar? ""Do it,"" she says. ""Once people experience cities like this, they are enthused.""It is a thought that echoes those of Steve Melia.Back at the Centre for Transport and Society in Bristol, both he and Graham Parkhurst are also keen to stress that government - as well as city authorities - must also help drive change.Nudge theory tactics such as tax breaks on buying bikes and altering planning policy to reward developments discouraging private cars would help, they say. So too would the ""gamification"" of walking - schemes where city residents can win rewards for using their legs instead of wheels.""A relatively small amount of money going into something like that would make it back in a reduced health service bill because you have a fitter, more active population,"" says Parkhurst.The reduced air pollution, he adds, would help the NHS too.One in 19 deaths of people living in urban areas is caused by pollution according to a new study by the Centre for Cities. Strip away the main polluter - cars - and that number goes down. Put simply, people live longer.The challenge, of course, may be how to do all this while ensuring such places remain accessible to those with mobility difficulties.Blue badge access, priority for mobility scooters, better (electric) bus services and the development of those automated pods would all help ease potential issues, experts say.""I think the argument that a city with fewer cars is somehow less inclusive is a misnomer,"" says Melia again. ""It would be the opposite.""Streets, he says, would become more spacious and wheelchair-friendly; public transport would be more reliable and efficient without so much traffic; and those granted blue badge permissions would have a clearer run of roads.As the conversation draws to a close, talk turns to how York might look in a decade. Could he imagine a scene like that described at the beginning of this article?""It has to go that way,"" he says. ""It needs political will but we can't just keep building roads and pumping out more emissions. Our cities need to change. The future has to be different.""",Newspaper; Web Publication

And what would car-free cities here look like anyway?A sprawling car park outside a sprawling shopping centre on the outskirts of Bristol is probably not the obvious place to find the answer to either of those questions.But at the Mall at Cribbs Causeway this week a team of developers, software engineers and transport academics were here hoping to offer a small glimpse into the future.They were road-testing a £5.6m driverless pod - the sort of electric sci-fi buggy some strategists hope could one day zip people around car-less city centres.But, as is the way of these things, not everything ran smoothly.After more than two years state-of-the-art development - radar, lidar and vision processing are all key - the buggy, called Capri, kept being rendered immobile by the, er, sun.The onboard sensors repeatedly mistook the morning glare for an object in the vehicle's path, causing it to repeatedly brake.""Teething issue,"" noted George Lunt, technical director at Aecom, the infrastructure company leading the public-private project. ""Better it stops when it shouldn't, than it keeps going when it should stop.""Such hiccups aside - and, by the end of the week, it appeared resolved - the government is seemingly committed to such driverless technology.It has invested an estimated £250m in similar research projects since 2015 and has said it would like autonomous vehicles appearing on roads by next year. Indeed, if current tests in Scotland run smoothly, transport company Stagecoach says the UK's first driverless bus could be scheduled between Edinburgh and Fife in early 2021. Albeit, a driver would actually remain on board at all times.""It's ambitious,"" says Lunt as the Capri tootles about like something from Mos Eisley, the fictional spaceport town in Star Wars. ""But there are so many benefits in terms of reduced environment impact, economic development and improving road safety. It would revolutionise the way we move around.""Nonetheless, here in this car park such a future feels an awfully long way off. Technological issues, public scepticism about safety and the sheer cost of development could all prove significant roadblocks before such pods are seen in our cities.In the meantime, many strategists argue, there is a rather cheaper, older bit of kit which, in fact, should be the focus when it comes to transforming how we travel: the bicycle.The Netherlands may today be the bike capital of the world but it was not inevitable it would be so.In the Sixties, the place was as in thrall to the automobile as the rest of the western world. Entire neighbourhoods in cities like Amsterdam and Eindhoven were bulldozed for highways.But, partially motivated by sky-rocketing motoring deaths - including 400 children in 1971 alone - a political decision was made that would transform the country: here, almost uniquely in Europe, cyclists would be prioritised over cars.Money was pumped into creating bike-friendly paths, nation-wide car free days were held (photos show children playing on deserted motorways), and schools ordered to give mandatory safety lessons.As early as the mid-Seventies, the northern city of Groningen was already turning virtually car free. There, a 24-year-old councillor, Max van den Berg, had been placed in charge of urban planning, and used his portfolio to push through measures redirecting cars around - rather than into - the historic centre. Roads were blocked off - initially with rubble - and dedicated cycle lanes laid out around restored buildings. Four local politicians resigned over the scheme and the city's chamber of commerce petitioned the Dutch queen to stop it.Yet almost 50 years on, Groningen is widely considered one of the most liveable cities in a country full of them. The chamber of commerce now credits the pedestrianised streets - and the sociability they encourage - with allowing independent business to thrive.""But the point is that there is no special low countries gene which makes people there more inclined to cycling,"" says Dr Steve Melia, a senior academic with the Centre for Transport and Society at the University of the West of England, in Bristol. ""Cycling is prioritised there because a decision was made in the Sixties. There is absolutely no reason that same decision can't be made here.""No one, he adds, visits Amsterdam and says: ""You know what it needs? More cars!""He is worth listening to on this stuff.Melia has spent two decades researching and advising both local and national government on transport infrastructure development. His 2015 book Urban Transport Without the Hot Air, saw him cycle across seven European countries to assess how urban travel could be made more sustainable. He himself neither drives nor flies. He was, for what it's worth, fined last year for taking part in Extinction Rebellion protests.Nonetheless, his overriding conclusion across 20 years of research is that the only realistic way of reducing congestion and pollution in the UK is to undergo a similar transformation as in the Netherlands.Politically, he suggests, this could be easier than often imagined.That's because small-scale pedestrianisation schemes, while often controversial when first mooted, are almost always overwhelmingly popular after completion. Queen Square in Bristol, Briggate in Leeds, and Cornmarket Street on Oxford are all well-known local examples of once traffic-clogged areas thriving after being made car free.""Once these changes are made, with very few exceptions, the consensus quickly becomes that it was unthinkable vehicles were ever allowed there,"" says Melia, adding that pedestrianising entire city centres would be met with the same long-term reaction: once done, future generations would look back and see the 80 years of car dominance as a bizarre historic anomaly.His colleague at the centre, Professor Graham Parkhurst, agrees.He points out that it took 50 years to build the majority of the UK's motorway network, and about the same for the railway system.""There's no reason you couldn't create a biking infrastructure in a similar time frame,"" he says. ""And, crucially, you would be able to do that at a fraction of the cost it takes to build the same amount of road infrastructure.""This, roughly speaking, is what York is aiming to do.Cars will not quite be banned here but more likely a series of measures taken to make driving more difficult. Access roads into the centre - already limited because of the surrounding medieval walls - will probably be restricted to just a couple of inlets; parking spaces hugely reduced; and swathes of road turned over exclusively to walkers and bikers.To accompany this perceived stick, the carrot.Cycling, walking and mobility scooter infrastructure could be improved using the windfall that comes from not having to expand and build more roads, while streets would be beautified through planters, parklets and public seating. Permits for events - such as outdoor cinema or mini markets - would be made easier to acquire to encourage footfall. Restaurants and bars may be given presumed permission to set up tables outside. Mobile charging points and free wi-fi would be installed to boost ""linger power"".""I felt as a council, we'd been making a great play of declaring a climate emergency but there was no real action being taken,"" says Jonny Crawshaw, the Labour councillor who first proposed the now-approved motion to restrict all non-essential vehicle access. ""We're living at a time when people, especially younger people, want to have less impact on the environment so there is a real opportunity to do something truly transformational.""The reaction since the policy was approved has been largely positive, he says - though not universally so.Comments on the York Press website have expressed concerns about the potential economic impact and practicalities of enforcing such a scheme, while the York and North Yorkshire Chamber of Commerce - though keen not to dismiss environmental considerations - has asked for an urgent meeting with council leader Keith Aspden. ""Our members have many questions,"" notes president Andrew Digwood.All the same, with its ancient walls providing a natural exclusion zone and an economy with a heavy tourism base - and with a progressive council coalition of Lib Dems and Greens - this does feel like a proposal with momentum.""There is appetite for change,"" says Crawshaw. ""If we're bold, we can make York a model for others. If we don't lead the way, others will.""In fact, others already have. Just not in the UK.An initiative to transform Lyon, in France, has seen swathes of former roads made traffic free and a sprawling car park adjacent to the city's Saone River replaced with an actual park. In Freiburg, Germany, meanwhile, a neighbourhood of 5,000 people has been built without drives or parking spots. Cars that use the area's deliberately narrow roads have to stick within a speed limit of 3mph.But it is Oslo that perhaps the most significant change is happening.A wide-ranging transformation first launched in 2015 is incrementally turning the Norwegian capital into what will be the first major European capital entirely without cars.Although, says Hanna Marcussen, the city council's deputy leader for urban development, ""if I was to start all over, I wouldn't call it car free. I personally hear that and imagine lovely streets. But a lot of people hear it and think we're taking something away"".What would she call it instead? ""Perhaps people-friendly city?"" the Green Party member says. ""This is what it is.""Certainly, public space now hums with (non-motorised) life. Streets have been rebuilt for walkers and cyclists, with the emphasis on more trees, more benches and, for those using public transport, more live information boards.In summer, there are open-air art exhibitions and food markets in roads previously jammed with traffic; in winter, ice rinks and skiing tracks. The iconic city hall, previously hidden behind a roaring roundabout, has now been opened up.Cars haven't been banned but the city has been remodelled bit-by-bit to discourage their use: almost 1,000 car parking spaces have been removed while previous arterial routes have become one-way or blocked altogether to all but buses, emergency vehicles and those with special permits. As in Groningen 40 years earlier, it has been made so cars are essentially the least efficient way to travel.""There was opposition when we started,"" says Marcussen. ""We had to say to those people that, I'm sorry, this is happening, it will not change. But work with us, let's have dialogue, and we will address your concerns.""Mainly, she says, it was businesses worried about footfall. In the event, it has gone up by 14 per cent in streets where work has been done. Biking now equates to seven per cent of all journeys made and public transport 29 per cent.""But we expect those figures to rise further as there is a cultural shift,"" she adds.Certainly, residents appear to have bought into the scheme: at the 2019 city elections, the Greens, which have driven the change as part of the council's ruling coalition, doubled their number of seats.What is her advice for UK cities hoping to achieve something similar? ""Do it,"" she says. ""Once people experience cities like this, they are enthused.""It is a thought that echoes those of Steve Melia.Back at the Centre for Transport and Society in Bristol, both he and Graham Parkhurst are also keen to stress that government - as well as city authorities - must also help drive change.Nudge theory tactics such as tax breaks on buying bikes and altering planning policy to reward developments discouraging private cars would help, they say. So too would the ""gamification"" of walking - schemes where city residents can win rewards for using their legs instead of wheels.""A relatively small amount of money going into something like that would make it back in a reduced health service bill because you have a fitter, more active population,"" says Parkhurst.The challenge, of course, may be how to do all this while ensuring such places remain accessible to those with mobility difficulties.Blue badge access, priority for mobility scooters, better (electric) bus services and the development of those automated pods would all help ease potential issues, experts say.""I think the argument that a city with fewer cars is somehow less inclusive is a misnomer,"" says Melia again. ""It would be the opposite.""Streets, he says, would become more spacious and wheelchair-friendly; public transport would be more reliable and efficient without so much traffic; and those granted blue badge permissions would have a clearer run of roads.As the conversation draws to a close, talk turns to how York might look in a decade. Could he imagine a scene like that described at the beginning of this article?""It has to go that way,"" he says. ""It needs political will but we can't just keep building roads and pumping out more emissions. Our cities need to change. The future has to be different.""",Newspaper
7,"She can't say no': the Ugandan men demanding to be breastfed;A study is looking into the coercive practice in Uganda, amid calls for the government to address the issue","January 28, 2020 Tuesday",International,The Guardian (London),756,756,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,Louise Hunt,"She can't say no': the Ugandan men demanding to be breastfedA study is looking into the coercive practice in Uganda, amid calls for the government to address the issue","Jane's* husband likes breast milk. ""He says he likes the taste of it, and that it helps him in terms of his health. He feels good afterwards,"" said the 20-year-old from Uganda, who has a six-month-old baby.Jane said her husband started asking for her milk the night she came home from the hospital after giving birth. ""He said it was to help me with the milk flow. I felt it was OK.""Men drinking their partners' breast milk is not uncommon in some areas of Uganda, and in parts of Tanzania and            Kenya. It is now being linked to gender violence and coercive behaviour and there are concerns over the impact on babies' nutrition. Little was known about the practice until Uganda's minister of state for health, Sarah Opendi,            broke the silence in parliament in 2018 and warned against ""a growing culture of men demanding to suckle, which was becoming a problem for some breastfeeding mothers and their babies"".The reasons for the phenomenon, and its consequences, are now the subject of what is believed to be the first preliminary study into the practice, by Kyambogo University in Kampala and Britain's University of Kent, supported by the Global Challenges Research Fund.""It was very much an exploratory mission. We didn't know if we would find anybody willing to talk to us who admitted to doing it. We didn't even really know if it was real or not,"" said Dr Rowena Merritt, a British behavioural scientist who specialises in public health, and a lead researcher on the project.The study focused on the rural Buikwe district, in the central region, where the behaviour is reported to be common.Anonymised interviews were conducted with a group of four men who worked as ""boda boda"" motorcycle taxi drivers.""One said: 'I know other men do it, but we've never talked about it.' So that to me would suggest that it is a common behaviour, but it isn't socially accepted,"" said Merritt.The preliminary research suggested that men often drink before the child is fed, usually once a day, sometimes more frequently, and for about an hour at a time.The men said they found it energising. ""It sustains me, I come home for lunch and it relieves stress in the middle of the working day,"" said Thomas*.""There is a belief in some communities that breast milk has energising and curative powers, even curing diseases such as HIV and Aids and cancer,"" said Dr Peter           Rukundo, a senior lecturer at Kyambogo University who assisted with the research.The men also said it was a way of initiating sex and showing affection. ""But then it is happening to women who have just given birth,"" he added.One man told the researchers: ""When breastfeeding, I feel like I'm being looked after like a child, and this becomes addictive. I feel like a prince.""Women did not seem to have much choice in the matter. ""It appears to be a hugely coerced behaviour from the people we spoke to,"" added Merritt.When asked what might happen if she said no, one woman replied: ""I fear that my husband might go elsewhere if I wouldn't let it happen.""Thomas admitted that resistance could result in the women being beaten. ""She can't say no because you become obsessed, it's hard to stop. If women say no it can cause violence, it's a big issue,"" he said.The behaviour has been linked to gender-based violence in the Karamoja region in north-east Uganda. ""The principal nutritionist has claimed that it is a common practice there in the form of violence, that when the men get drunk some went for the breasts forcefully,"" said Rukundo.Health professionals, including midwives and nutritionists, told researchers about cases where babies had to be given formula milk because partners wanted the breast milk, and where women came to clinic with infected or bitten nipples caused by a man suckling. There are also risks to babies of cross-infection from the man's saliva.""There is a gap in public awareness of the risks in such practices. But the challenge is we don't have the evidence of the magnitude of this behaviour. We need a survey on prevalence,"" said Rukundo.He also called on government and development partners to work together to mitigate harm. ""We don't have any clear message or deliberate effort, despite the health minister saying the issue is there. So, in a way, it is denial. If they remain silent, the issue will remain underground,"" he said.Merritt added: ""The fear for me, is the longer that this continues it will become part of the culture and tradition for the next generation. I see parallels with FGM.""*names have been changed",Newspaper

Contestants seem less bothered about coupling up than they are about the fact that they are on what is, essentially, a free holiday - one where they get to lounge by a pool removed from an outside world where climate change, Brexit and Mrs Brown's Boys are all still horribly relevant. In the latest episode, literally nothing happened. I don't mean barely anything, I mean: Nothing Happened. Contestants were tasked to the bare minimum of human functions: eating, drinking and talking to one another, mostly in monosyllables or nonsensical slang terms. In one scene, a contestant could barely muster the energy to fork a single piece of tomato into his mouth, as his date asked, for the millionth time, ""So what are you looking for in a relationship?"" In another, contestant Leanne realised she felt no attraction whatsoever to would-be-boyfriend Mike, and promptly dumped him. So far, not one of these ""couples"" look likely to last five seconds outside of the show.Last year, we were bombarded with headlines about how young people - mostly millennials - were ruining everything for everyone else: avocado shortages, the property market, politics, tea, an ailing diamond industry, paper napkins, bars of soap, golf, the 9-5 work day, and the death of boxed cereal. In between, there were further articles asking why young people had fallen out of love with: the British cuppa, Jeremy Corbyn, safe sex, cars, and meat. What they haven't asked, yet, is whether young people have fallen out of love with love itself.Studies have suggested that younger generations are drifting away from what were once considered the ultimate aspirations: University, job, marriage, children, retirement. Last year, a viral article inThe Guardian interviewed a behavioural scientist, or ""happiness expert"", who said women were happier without children or a spouse. The year before, a study by the Pew Research Center, millennials are three times as likely to never get married, compared to their grandparents. If they do marry, millennials are taking their time, and spending longer to get to know one another. Is it really surprising, then, that we struggle to identify with the contestants on Love Island, whose only priority seems to be finding ""the one"" in a matter of weeks?I'd rather see more producers following The Masked Singer's example, ergo, come up with the most ludicrous, insane idea ever and turn it into a TV show. Twenty-year-olds competing against one another to see who can get out of their student overdraft first. Big Brother, but with journalists trying to do Dry January.

Boris Johnson trying to live on Universal Credit for a month...A lack of imagination is what's been slowly killing reality TV for years.

9,Phone app checks if students go to class,"January 29, 2020 Wednesday",International,thetimes.co.uk,273,273,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,"Will Pavia, New York",Phone app checks if students go to class,"Tracking devices installed in lecture halls to monitor student attendance have raised fears of Big Brother intrusion at dozens of universities across the United States.The technology, which registers a signal from an app on the students' phones, was meant to ensure that athletes on scholarships were attending classes. Some devices, however, go further.Mitch Daniels, the president of Purdue University, said that staff could draw on ""a massive amount of fascinating information"" about students' lives, and might study how gym attendance, or meals with certain other students or a pattern of internet browsing might affect academic performance.In an article for                    The Washington Post                    he warned that ""with the best of motives, schools like ours will feel the urge to use more and more personal data"". He compared the hopes some would have of ""nudging"" students' behaviour to China's social credit system, in which citizens and businesses receive a rating for their conduct and trustworthiness.Aaron Benz, the founder of Degree Analytics, one of the companies involved, said that the idea was based partly on his own experiences: while at college he had cancer diagnosed and chemotherapy left him bedridden in his dorm for several days.""If it were left to my own devices, I would have dropped out,"" he said on his company's website. He did not, because he had professors and friends checking up on him.He argued that Degree Analytics lends universities the same vigilance, allowing them to track patterns of behaviour and check on students whose habits change abruptly, or who never leave their dormitories.",Newspaper; Web Publication
10,An equivocal book for a polarised world,"February 3, 2020 Monday",International,"Financial Times (London, England)",715,715,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,GilesWilkes,An equivocal book for a polarised world,"This is a brave time to publish a book laying bare the techniques of public policy. Affection for the technocracy is at a low ebb. The policy wonk is often mocked as a Gradgrindian calculator blind to all that really matters - sovereignty, identity, a sustainable environment - yet oddly powerful.So populist revolts from Brexit and France's gilets jaunes to Extinction Rebellion and the election of US president Donald Trump are portrayed as a people's rebellion against policy experts, whose blind spots are blamed for the 2008 financial crisis, global warming, soaring inequality and more.But there is already an academic field devoted to studying the failure of economics. They call it ""economics"". It is a discipline that progresses through a constant, anxious appraisal of its own flaws and gaps, and speaks much more loudly about what we don't know than what we must do.This book has a self-confident title. But in its pages, Diane Coyle, the professor of public policy at Cambridge university, appends to every conclusion an intelligent caveat. Uncertainty and malfunction abound. Markets fail for a long list of reasons - incomplete information, perverse incentives, externality and power - and so governments intervene. But they fail too, beset by the same biases that sabotage markets. And at their heart sit people: irrational, fallible, stubbornly social animals, refusing to act as the model dictates.Faced with this mutually reinforcing maelstrom of dysfunction, you might wonder whether any policymaker has a better than random chance of improving things.Worse, apparent professional diffidence might be taken as an excuse to substitute whatever solution fits the political urge. But policymaking does not aim for perfect solutions. Instead, what we have is a guide to the tools and instruments: how they work, and where they fail. A market fundamentalist might look for answers in the creation of property rights to address, for example, the overfishing of oceans. But we also learn that too narrow an approach can impede better processes of collective management. When it comes to ""positional goods"", like a coveted place at college or an exclusive address, property rights can even be what causes the problem, driving the market towards artificial scarcity.A good economist makes it their job to understand the market, but not to force a market solution on to every problem. Often their insights will lead them the opposite way. There is no better example than the UK's attachment to its National Health Service, a massive, progressive system of rationed healthcare and a beautiful contrast to the market-failure-ridden monstrosity found in the US.Coyle's determination to avoid easy answers shows in her discussion of the well-hyped topic of behavioural economics. Of course behavioural context matters, but next to the commercial world, government is a hopeless amateur at nudging us to the right behaviour. Too often politicians judge a policy on how it sounds.The tension between the gut of politics and the brain of technocracy is a running theme. We must never forget that economics does not capture everything: we also value the freedom to make our own mistakes, and to punish bad behaviour even if it hurts us to do so. Such considerations are why context is everything in deciding the right course, and also why the best advice is often the ""zero option"" - do nothing.I finished this book feeling more positive about economics as a force for good. Life would be better if it sat beside the desk of every special adviser in government. But no one campaigns on a platform of correcting market failures, or vows to sit tight until the randomised controlled trial is done. Powerful politicians arrive with their conclusions already written down, and gather around them the officials willing to provide the right workings. The downside of a flexible, humble profession is that it can make an argument for almost anything.US president Harry Truman longed for a one-handed economist, because ""All my economists say 'on one hand' then 'but on the other'."" He was wrong to. Equivocal books do not usually do well in a polarised world. This one deserves to buck the trend.The reviewer is specialist partner at Flint Global and senior fellow at the UK's Institute for Government",Newspaper
11,"EU urged to adopt meat tax to tackle climate emergency;Levy would help offset impact of farming by raising price of steak in UK by 25%, says report","February 4, 2020 Tuesday",International,The Guardian (London),784,784,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,Damian Carrington Environment editor,"EU urged to adopt meat tax to tackle climate emergencyLevy would help offset impact of farming by raising price of steak in UK by 25%, says report","A ""sustainability charge"" on meat to cover its environmental damage could raise billions to help farmers and consumers produce and eat better food, according to a report.The levy, which would increase the price of a steak by about 25%, would be phased in over the next decade. The report focuses on EU countries and was produced for the Tapp Coalition of health, environment and animal welfare organisations. It says ""fair pricing"" for meat should be included in the forthcoming European ""green new deal"" and so-called farm to fork strategy.The report, produced by environmental research group CE Delft, analysed the costs of greenhouse gas emissions, other air and water pollution, and losses of wildlife associated with livestock production. It estimated that covering these costs would increase the price of beef by (EURO)0.47 (40p) per 100g. This would increase the cost of a 227g supermarket steak in the UK by about 25%.The levy on pork and chicken would be lower owing to their smaller environmental impact, at (EURO)0.36 (31p)/100g and (EURO)0.17 (14p)/100g respectively. The report suggests such charges could reduce consumption of beef in the EU by 67%, pork by 57% and chicken by 30% by 2030.As well as reducing emissions by 120m tonnes a year, the charges would raise (EURO)32bn a year for EU member states, according to the report.The Tapp Coalition said about half of this should be given to help farmers move their production away from meat, which could increase individual farm incomes by thousands of euros per year.The rest should be used to reduce the cost of fruit and vegetables, support poorer families and help developing countries deal with the climate crisis.Jeroom Remmers, a Tapp Coalition director, said: ""Europeans eat roughly 50% more meat than is recommended in dietary health guidelines. [So] we could also save billions of euros every year in lower healthcare costs.""In November, three European health associations wrote to Frans Timmermans, the senior European commissioner leading the green new deal initiative. They said: "" Numerous studies in recent years have shown that a shift to healthy, more plant-rich diets can deliver important health, environmental and economic benefits.""A carbon tax on high-impact food is also backed by a second report, from the Behavioural Insights Team (Bit), a social purpose company part-owned by the UK government. It further suggests making plant-based food the default choice at catered events or on flights.Recent research has shown that a huge reduction in meat-eating in rich nations is essential to tackle the climate emergency. Other work indicates that avoiding meat and dairy products is the            single biggest way to reduce your environmental impact on the planet.""Including the environmental cost of animal protein in the price is a crucial element of meeting EU targets for climate, biodiversity, public health, and animal welfare,"" said Prof Pier Vellinga at Wageningen University in the Netherlands and chair of the Tapp Coalition.The report from Bit, also known as the ""nudge unit"" set up by David Cameron in 2010, examines how governments, the food industry and campaign groups can help shift diets away from meat.As well as supporting a carbon tax on high-impact food, it says governments could lead by example, by ""removing or reducing unsustainable foods from public canteens in hospitals, schools and government offices"". It also says practical cooking skills could be taught in schools and colleges.Food companies could make plant-based products the default choice, for example at catered events or on flights, the Bit report said. It also suggested marketing plant-based food as ""delicious, normal, and satisfying, not as light, abstemious, or overtly healthy or vegetarian"". Another proposal is placing veggie burgers alongside their meat counterparts instead of separating them on menus or in supermarket aisles.The report said campaign groups could reduce the perceived complexity of sustainable eating by promoting clear rules of thumb, such as ""red meat's a treat"".Toby Park, the head of energy and sustainability at Bit, said: ""Governments, industry and consumers around the world are more aware than ever of the need to live within our planet's means.""While some of the solutions will come from technical advancements, there is huge potential and need to reduce our environmental impacts with some simple behaviour changes.""In the UK, the National Farmers' Union says agriculture can become climate neutral by 2040 without cutting beef production. Instead, it says three-quarters of farming emissions can be offset by growing fuel for power stations and then capturing and burying the carbon dioxide.",Newspaper

Travel buyers know the real cost of an ineffective travel programme and work diligently to optimise their systems.","The lack of standardised, holistic measurement tools can make demonstrating success a challenge, and even negate progress.Shortcomings in financial metrics Traditional financial metrics are relatively easy to track, making them some of the most popular forms of measurement, based on a recent study1 by the Association of Corporate Travel Executives (ACTE) and BCD Travel.The study found that of the surveyed travel buyers, 91% use spend and savings to inform their travel programmes, and 84% track booking statistics.While financial metrics are certainly important to the organisation and its business goals, they cannot provide a full picture of a travel programme's strengths or shortcomings.The pure expense of transportation and lodging fees may not accurately represent the cost of a trip, ignoring factors like traveller productivity and trip efficiency. Anyone who has suffered a maddening day of travel knows it can have a real impact on the quality and speed of their work.Obstacles to better measurement When considering experience-based factors like trip success and traveller friction, the lack of an industry-wide definition can hamper effective measurement.Travel managers agree that considering these aspects of their programmes can help their organisations better understand traveller needs, as well as improve services (47%) and policy compliance (37%).Another key obstacle to better quality measurement in business travel is a lack of reliable data - low traveller feedback rates and the subjective nature of many metrics can lead to fragmented and unreliable data.Working from incomplete data sets may mislead travel buyers as they assess their programmes, undermining their efforts to improve.Engaging with stakeholders and gaining their buy-in presents a third obstacle to quality measurement. In fact, 25% of travel managers find it difficult to get senior leadership buy-in - which can be a major impediment to change.Building stronger data sets for successful future travel programmes Creating a well-framed rubric for gathering objective and subjective data will help the industry gain a more balanced view of the value and success of a corporate travel programme.ACTE and BCD Travel are working to bring the industry together, building consensus in how to measure programme success. As a first step, we've defined four terms (traveller engagement; traveller friction; traveller satisfaction and trip success rate), as well as provided recommendations for how to begin measuring each of these metrics - and this is just the beginning.Source: 1: https://www.cvent.com/pub/eMarketing/Pages/WebEmail_New.aspx?emstub=7505bff4-86a3-42c9-9088-84c55a68387e",Newspaper
14,Number of renters saving for own home dwindling,"February 5, 2020 Wednesday",International,The Independent (United Kingdom),786,786,England & Wales,KATE HUGHES,Number of renters saving for own home dwindling,"As the Brexit bounce delivers annual house price growth at a 14-month high, four in five Britons who don't own property say they are now prioritising other financial goals over getting on the UK housing ladder.With marked shifts in the renting demographic over recent years, 82 per cent are now focusing on aims like raising a family, paying education debt, living in a convenient location, travelling or even funding hobbies rather than saving for their first home, according to research by Dutch bank ING.Although the vast majority would still like to own their own home, most feel the UK housing market is on the ""wrong track"", with accessibility challenges the major driver behind a lack of enthusiasm.Almost 40 per cent of renters who have never owned a property say they don't expect to be able to buy, and just 9 per cent plan to purchase a home before the age of 30. Ownership of the home you live in has been declining since the start of the century.The latest government figures from the English Housing Survey, for example, found that 15 million, or 64 per cent, of the estimated 23.5 million households in England were owner-occupied in 2019. That's a fall from 71 per cent in 2003.The private rented sector currently accounts for around 4.6 million households. At just under 20 per cent, that's almost double the figure in the 1990s. Just over half of them, an increasing proportion of whom have dependent children, expect to eventually buy a property.With renting costs accounting for a third of their income compared with mortgage bills worth only 18 per cent, they'll now need an average deposit of just over £42,360 to do so.""Lots of us want to own our own home one day. Not only because it's considered to be a smart financial decision, but because home ownership is an emotional and personal goal,"" says Jessica Exton, a behavioural scientist at ING.""But houses are expensive, and many perceive them as only becoming more so. Some are consequently taking longer to save their deposit and buying later in life. Given these extended timeframes, it's not necessarily surprising that many are finding additional reasons to spend and save in the shorter term. Funding travel today, while planning to buy a home soon, for example.""""Everyone has different financial priorities, but our preferences should not be dictated by a lack of accessibility. Some people simply do not find the prospect of being a homebuyer appealing; they do not want to be tied to one place or one property,"" adds John Ellmore, director of comparison site Know Your Money.""However, as house prices have risen at pace over the past decade, more and more consumers have come to hold the view that getting onto the property ladder is simply out of their reach. But what can be done to reverse this trend?""Improving access to education is a great place to start. It is important that potential homebuyers know how much they would need to save for a deposit, what costs are involved in buying a property and what kind of support is available to them, such as help-to-buy schemes and stamp duty exemption.""Work must clearly be done to address the imbalance between supply and demand in the housing market, which is driving up prices.""Housebuilding policy is devolved to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. In England, for example, both the number of properties started and completed each year have been gradually increasing since the financial crisis, but still fall significantly below government targets.In 2018 the then-housing secretary, Sajid Javid, launched a new national housing agency designed to deliver 300,000 new homes each year by ""the mid 2020s"".The latest government figures suggest around 46,000 new homes were completed in the third quarter of 2019. Up by 11 per cent compared with the year before, that currently only equates to roughly 184,000 a year.""But that should not overshadow the fact that there are saving options and mortgage products that are really well suited to first-time buyers,"" adds Ellmore. ""The property industry - from brokers and lenders to estate agents and advisors - must help guide potential homebuyers through the important questions so they do not feel this option is unattainable when it might not be.""East Hertfordshire may have been named the UK's best place to live, according to the Halifax Quality of Life survey for 2020, but in affordability terms, Copeland in Cumbria comes in at the most affordable place to own a home.House prices in this area cost an average of 3.5 times the average annual salary. For first time buyers, the figure drops to 2.9 times the average salary.The most affordable housing by size is available in Mid Ulster, Northern Ireland, at £978 per square metre.",Newspaper
15,Social media makes you eat the same as your friends: People eat more fruit and veg 'if they think their peers on Facebook are doing the same',"February 6, 2020 Thursday",International,MailOnline,866,866,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,Vanessa Chalmers Health Reporter For Mailonline,Social media makes you eat the same as your friends: People eat more fruit and veg 'if they think their peers on Facebook are doing the same',"•Junk food consumption also increased by a third in line with friends' choices•Researchers said the belief may give people a 'licence to eat' the wrong things•It may be due to specific social media posts, or general belief about their dietWhat our friends on social media eat influences our own food choices, a study shows.Scientists found people ate an extra portion of fruit and vegetable each day if they thought their peers on Facebook were doing the same. The copycat tactics are not limited to healthy eating habits - junk food consumption increased by a third if people believed their friends were also indulging. Researchers warned that the approval from our friends who are chomping down on unhealthy foods may give us a dangerous 'licence to eat'. Normally it's social media stars that are thought to sway our diet. But this study suggests our influences are closer to home. The researchers from Aston University, Birmingham, said the findings could be useful for tackling bad eating habits in children using social media. Study leader Lily Hawkins, a PhD student in health psychology, said: 'This study suggests we may be influenced by our social peers more than we realise when choosing certain foods.'We seem to be subconsciously accounting for how others behave when making our own food choices.'So if we believe our friends are eating plenty of fruit and veg we're more likely to eat fruit and veg ourselves.'On the other hand, if we feel they're happy to consume lots of snacks and sugary drinks, it can give us a ""licence to overeat"" foods that are bad for our health.'The implication is that we can use social media as a tool to ""nudge"" each other's eating behaviour within friendship groups, and potentially use this knowledge as a tool for public health interventions.'                     ARE YOUR FRIENDS MAKING YOU FATTER?                    Your social circle may be the reason you are overweight, a study in March 2019 suggested.Experts warned that obesity can spread through communities like a 'social contagion'.Researchers studied hundreds of military families - who can't choose where they live - across the US.Their results revealed if you move to an area with a high rate of obesity, it increases your risk of becoming obese, too.For every percentage-point increase in the local obesity rate, the chances a person would be overweight or obese increased by up to six per cent.The risk of the parent becoming obese or overweight went up by five per cent for every single percentage increase of obesity in the area. The longer the families lived there, the more likely they were to see the weight pile on.The University of Southern California researchers said people adopt behaviours of others subconsciously. One possibility is that people with similar interests and backgrounds tend to locate in similar areas. Another explanation may be people are all influenced by the shared environment, such as opportunities for exercising and healthy eating.A third explanation may be that obesity is transmitted through social influence.In the study, published in the scientific journal Appetite, the researchers asked 369 university students to estimate the amount of fruit, veg, 'calorie-dense snacks' and sugary drinks their Facebook friends ate on a daily basis.This information was cross-referenced with the participants' own eating habits and showed that those who felt their social circles 'approved' of eating junk food consumed significantly more themselves.Meanwhile those who thought their friends ate a healthy diet ate more portions of fruit and veg. Their perceptions could have come from seeing friends' posts about the food and drink they consumed, or simply a general impression of their overall health.Scientists note that the study showed no significant link between people's eating habits and their Body Mass Index (BMI).They are now looking to track a group over time to see whether the influence of social media on eating habits has longer-term impact on weight. The most recent figures from the NHS's Health Survey for England showed that, in 2018, only 28 per cent of adults were eating the recommended five portions of fruit and vegetables per day. Aisling Pigott, a registered dietitian and spokesperson for the British Dietetic Association, said: 'Research such as this demonstrates how we are influenced by online perceptions about how others eat.'The promotion of positive health messages across social media, which are focused on promoting healthy choices and non-restrictive relationships with food and body, could nudge people into making positive decisions around the food they eat.'We do have to be mindful of the importance of 'nudging' positive behaviours and not 'shaming' food choices on social media as a health intervention.'We know that generating guilt around food is not particularly helpful when it comes to lifestyle change and maintenance.'Professor Claire Farrow, Director of Aston University's Applied Health Research Group, added: 'The important new findings from this study could help shape how we deliver interventions that help them [young people] adopt healthy eating habits from a young age - and stick with them for life.'

16,Winter fuel payments: is it time to throw them on the fire?;Claer Barrett Serious Money Financial Commentator of the Year,"February 8, 2020 Saturday",International,"Financial Times (London, England)",808,808,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,Claer Barrett,Winter fuel payments: is it time to throw them on the fire?Claer Barrett Serious Money Financial Commentator of the Year,"U niversal benefits are worth little in cash terms to Britain's wealthiest, yet people get very hot under the collar if the government threatens to take them away.Scrapping free TV licences for all but the poorest over-75s showed the government is not afraid of upsetting older voters - but could winter fuel payments end up being burnt? Introduced in 1997 by Gordon Brown, the then chancellor, the winter fuel allowance goes to nearly 12m people and costs the Treasury about £2bn a year.Nearly everyone in receipt of the state pension receives a tax-free payment of £100-£300 in December depending on their age and household formation - regardless of whether they're in fuel poverty or could afford to burn wads of £50 notes.There is a small group of dogged pensioners, including Lord Brooke of Alderthorpe, who have tried to opt out.""I see it as a government giveaway that I don't need,"" he says. ""Every year, I get a letter and my wife gets a letter saying when it will be paid - how much do all these letters cost to post?"" Statistics show this is a poorly targeted benefit, with hundreds of millions of pounds automatically deposited in bank accounts of wealthy people who have no difficulties paying their heating bills.A quarter of those receiving winter fuel payments live in a household with financial wealth of more than £100,000, excluding property and pensions, according to research by the Social Market Foundation (SMF). The think-tank also found that one-fifth of recipients had household income over £40,000 a year.One response to Lord Brooke's complaint has been that those who didn't need the payments could donate them to the Commissioners for the Reduction of the National Debt. That's quite a faff, but there is now a phone number on the www.gov.uk website to call and opt out. However, the Department for Work and Pensions told me that only 150 people bothered to do this in 2018.Other solutions include taxing the benefit or means testing it, though the Tories bottled out of a 2017 manifesto pledge to do so.To simplify the admin, it could be restricted to those in receipt of Pension Credit. This is what the government has done with free TV licences, inadvertently sparking awareness of the patchy take-up of Pension Credit.This week, I heard about an alternative solution. Could the government make it possible for people to donate winter fuel payments to charity by ticking a box on their annual notification letter? The SMF and the Rory and Elizabeth Brooks Foundation see this as an opportunity for mass philanthropy. They commissioned a YouGov survey that indicated better-off pensioners like the idea. In total, 16 per cent of those polled said they were ""very likely"" or ""fairly likely"" to donate it to charity - rising to 33 per cent for those with an annual income above £50,000. Assuming they all ticked the box, this could raise £320m.I attended a round table with the SMF this week to debate the proposals.First, should the money be given to charity at all? Research strongly indicated that opting for a charitable donation would elicit more popular support than simply giving it back to the government. While I appreciate the power of nudge theory, this doesn't feel like a fair solution, as the benefits system is skewed towards supporting older, wealthier pensioners over younger people of working age.But what if the money was donated to charities set up to deal with fuel poverty? This is not just an issue for pensioners, and the SMF estimates that £320m would be enough to provide cavity wall insulation for 640,000 homes, cutting fuel consumption and energy bills.Alternatively, a body similar to the National Lottery Community Fund could split the donations among charities supporting a range of good causes.The government has already set up the Dormant Assets Scheme, which gives money left in bank and building society accounts for over 15 years to good causes.I was also intrigued to hear that a pilot scheme by Westminster Council, asking property owners in council tax ""Band H"" voluntarily to double their council tax, had been taken up by 644 property owners. The council directs the money towards young people and the homeless.But why stop at the winter fuel allowance? The SMF has calculated that if higher and additional rate taxpayers ticked a box to donate 5 per cent of their state pension to charity, this could raise nearly £250m per year.For now, the obvious solution for anyone inspired to give back is simply to donate what you receive from the winter fuel allowance to a charity of your choice. And assuming you tick the Gift Aid box, a tax boost from the government will further fuel your donation.Claer Barrett is the editor of FT Money, and a financial commentator on Eddie Mair's LBC drive-time show, on weekdays between 4-6pm: claer.barrett@ft.com; Twitter @Claerb; Instagram @Claerb",Newspaper
17,Popular policies don't make a popular Labour Party,"February 10, 2020 Monday",International,thetimes.co.uk,585,585,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,Ben Glover,Popular policies don't make a popular Labour Party,"A fallacy is haunting the Labour Party: the popular policy fallacy. Yes, we lost the election, the argument goes, but boy were our policies popular! So don't blame the policies, blame something - anything - else.It is true that opinion polls regularly show significant support for Labour policies, from nationalisation of the railways to higher taxes for the rich. But to believe that it will always be popular for a party to advocate for an apparently popular policy is wrong. Why?First, parties don't propose policies in isolation. They tend to come as part of a wider package, such as a manifesto. The public's response to a policy will therefore be shaped by the interaction between different policies and their overall effect. If the sum of the policies appears incredulous, as may have been the case with Labour's recent ""overloaded"" manifesto, voters can be turned off.Second, policies are served up for public consumption by politicians. Because of this, the public's response to a policy proposal will be heavily influenced by their preconceptions about that politician or party. This means that, counterintuitively, a policy that appears to be well supported in opinion polls may be unpopular when advocated for by a particular politician.That is why in focus groups conducted during the election campaign, voters often turned sour on policies they initially liked on discovering they were Labour policies. To followers of behavioural science, this is not news. Researchers have long known that humans often respond irrationally to a message delivered by someone they dislike.Consequently, it might be unwise for a party to advocate for something even if it appears in narrow polling terms to be a ""popular"" policy. This may be because the said policy plays into a brand weakness. For example, a policy such as free broadband may poll well in the abstract but could reinforce a view that Labour can't be trusted with public finances.How can these traps be avoided? We must remember that although opinion polls can tell us a lot, they should rarely be relied on alone to judge a policy's popularity. That is why at Demos we use focus groups, online discussions and even social media analysis to supplement the extremely useful insights that polling provides.Labour also needs a much better grasp of how it is viewed by the public if it is to avoid policies that perpetuate brand weaknesses. This will require a level of honesty that is too often lacking in the party: admitting that the public may dislike Labour for reasonable reasons, not because they have been misled by right wing press barons or lied to by xenophobes. This won't be easy: Labour members often struggle to see why the public have good faith reasons to disagree with them.It will also require everyone getting out of their bubble. This means speaking to the public for five long years, not flying in during the last weeks of a campaign to get out the Labour vote. It will also likely mean putting down social media. To adapt an old adage, it is the folly of too many to mistake the echo of leftie Twitter for the voice of the kingdom.This is not to say that Labour should abandon all of its policies. There are good and genuinely popular policies in its manifesto, which should remain. But the party must stop fooling itself that a supportive poll for an individual policy is proof that it's a vote winner. Only then might it have a shot at power again.

18,Algorithm can assess if depression drugs will work,"February 10, 2020 Monday",International,thetimes.co.uk,579,579,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,"Rhys Blakely, Science Correspondent",Algorithm can assess if depression drugs will work,"People with depression could be found effective treatments far more quickly through an artificial intelligence system that can predict whether a drug will work.Researchers at Stanford University in California believe that the technique, which uses an AI algorithm to analyse brain scans, could be used within five years in clinics to provide personalised recommendations on medication, cutting out the trial-and-error process used at present.The technique uses electroencephalography, a relatively cheap tool for monitoring electrical activity in the brain. An algorithm is then used to identify patterns of activity found in those patients who were most likely respond to sertraline, a type of antidepressant known as a selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitor (SSRI).""This study takes previous research showing that we can predict who benefits from an antidepressant and actually brings it to the point of practical utility,"" Dr Amit Etkin, professor of psychiatry and behavioural sciences at Stanford University in California, said. ""I will be surprised if this isn't used by clinicians within the next five years.""The study was published today in the journal                    Nature Biotechnology                   . It stems from a decades-long effort funded by the US government to develop better targeted treatments for depression and other mental illnesses.Depression has a range of symptoms, from lasting feelings of unhappiness and hopelessness, to losing interest in the things one used to enjoy. Many people with depression also have symptoms of anxiety, as well as physical symptoms such as constant fatigue, poor sleep, having no appetite, and aches and pains.Until now, however, there has been no way of objectively assessing a patient to judge whether a particular drug will work. ""As a psychiatrist, I know these patients differ a lot,"" Dr Etkin said. ""But we put them all under the same umbrella, and we treat them all the same way.""Previous studies have suggested that less than a third of people with depression who go to a doctor experience any remission of symptoms after their first treatment with an antidepressant.Madhukar Trivedi, professor of psychiatry at the University of Texas-Southwestern, a co-author of the study, said: ""It often takes many steps for a patient with depression to get better.""""We went into this thinking, 'Wouldn't it be better to identify at the beginning of treatment which treatments would be best for which patients?""The trial enrolled 309 people with depression who either received sertraline or a placebo.The researchers collected EEG data on the participants before they received any drug treatment.They then used an artificial intelligence technique known as machine learning to identify EEG patterns that predicted whether a person would subsequently respond to treatment.The researchers found that the technique provided a reliable forecast of which of the patients would respond to sertraline. The findings were validated in three additional groups of subjects.Further research suggested that those who were predicted to show little improvement with sertraline were more likely to respond to treatment involving transcranial magnetic stimulation, which involves bursts of magnetic energy being sent into the scalp, in combination with psychotherapy.In England, one in six people report experiencing a common mental health problem, such as anxiety and depression, in any given week, according to the charity Mind.",Newspaper; Web Publication

In the poorest areas, women are getting their first significant long-term illness at just 47 and men at 49 years old.The report, The Health of the Nation: A Strategy for Healthier Longer Lives, has been written by the All-Party Parliamentary Group (APPG) for Longevity. It found that women in the UK are living for 29 years in poor health and men for 23 years: an increase of 50% for women and 42% for men on previous estimates based on self-reported data.""A key reason for low productivity in the north is that health is worse and reducing this gap would therefore generate substantial gross value added, estimated at an additional £13.2bn,"" it concluded.Lord Geoffrey Filkin, joint APPG lead and co-author of the report, said the report contained important messages for the new prime minister's            promise to 'level up' the country.""

Improvements in health and health inequalities are necessary to unleash the potential of the whole country.""The APPG for Longevity has spent nine months working with a range of cross-party politicians, the government's Behavioural Insight Team and            Public Health England, as well as experts including the            King's Fund and the            Health Foundation on how to improve the nation's health.Their report found that the number of major illnesses suffered by older people will increase by 85% between 2015 and 2035. It also found older people in the poorest areas have 35% more spent on them by the NHS than older people in the richest areas.But the report also found that up to 75% of new cases of heart disease, stroke and type 2 diabetes, 40% of cancer incidence and dementia risks could be reduced if we cut smoking, unhealthy diet, harmful consumption of alcohol and insufficient physical activity.""This report describes both a shocking current picture - and an optimistic future one,"" said Damian Green, MP and chair of the APPG for Longevity. ""What is shocking is that far too many citizens get prematurely ill with illnesses that could have been avoided. Premature avoidable ill-health is rampant, and it is bad for individuals, our society and our economy.""The optimistic point is that we can change this,"" he added. ""But it will require action by charities, local authorities, business, academia, central government and by citizens themselves.""The report found that as our population ages there will be very large increases in the number of cases of ill-health over the next 15 years. In 2035 there will be around 16 million cases of dementia, arthritis, type 2 diabetes and cancers in people aged 65 and over - twice as many as in 2015.

20,The interminable torture of reading an undeserving business bestseller,"February 13, 2020 Thursday",International,thetimes.co.uk,919,919,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,Harry Wallop,The interminable torture of reading an undeserving business bestseller,"There are some things that are more predictable than death and taxes. Namely, in a British airport you will always have to walk through a labyrinthine duty-free shop before you can buy a coffee, the assistant in Boots will ask you for your boarding pass, and the book selection will be paltry.I was in Gatwick South Terminal last week and was cheered on seeing a bookshop but then despondent on seeing it was a WH Smith. A company that once brought the paperback to the masses now seems to shift little literature apart from £4.75 Peppa Pig magazines, diet books, the latest Bill Bryson and anything with f*** in the title.Oh, and lots and lots of business books. This is a section that I find as baffling as trying to remember who the education secretary is. (I had to look it up: it's Gavin Williamson. I know!)Business is a topic that encompasses all that is inspiring and despairing, complex and stupid about the modern world. And yet most of the books stocked on these shelves are dismal primers that are little better than: how to get rich quick, how to get away with working a three-day week, or how to use the way of the ninja to get a pay rise. Books that are a collection of ""actionable bullet points"", management gobbledegook and trite aphorisms. If you want an insight into the mindset of the British publishing and bookselling industry look no further than the fact that                    The                   Art of War,                    the ancient Chinese guide to how to grind down your enemy and use espionage, is now sold as a business book.Of course, you can find the odd very good book.                    Thinking, Fast and Slow                    by Daniel Kahneman is genuinely thought provoking. Then again, he has a Nobel prize, so maybe it's not surprising he has something to say. Another regular in the top ten is                    Shoe Dog                    by Phil Knight, which tells the fascinating story of how he founded Nike.But in the Gatwick WH Smith I spotted                    Who Moved My Cheese?                    by Spencer Johnson. I remember this coming out in the late 1990s. It was both lauded and mocked in equal measure - this was the era of New Labour, John Birt and his blue-sky thinking at the BBC, Royal Mail renaming itself Consignia. A time when management guff was taken very seriously.But that was a generation ago. Surely its message (whatever it was) had gone as stale as a piece of, well, cheese?Not at all. It is still in the top ten business books, according to the                    Sunday Times                    bestseller charts, which shows it shifted 1,935 copies in the four weeks to February 1. That's just in the UK. How is it possible for a 22-year-old management book to sell 2,000 copies a month? Indeed, since its publication in 1998 it has sold nearly 30 million copies in 44 languages.I bought it, hoping that within its thin covers (it has a mere 72 pages and very large type) I might be pleasantly surprised and find the secret to its phenomenal success.It turns out that it is quite the most dire, badly written, patronising book I have ever read. And I've been forced to read                    PJ Masks: Mayhem at the Museum                    to my youngest child.For starters, the book has this awful set-up, whereby a group of old friends gather at a college reunion in Chicago and one of them, Michael, tells them about a story that ""changed the way I look at change"".He then lumbers into this story, which starts: ""Once, long ago in a land far away, there lived four characters."" I kid you not.It's all downhill from there. The four characters are two mice called Scurry and Sniff, who - yes, you've guessed it - scurry and sniff out the cheese in their home, a maze, which they share with two Littlepeople, who are described as ""beings who were as small as mice but who looked and acted a lot like people today"". They are called Hem and Haw. Because one is hemmed in and one haws a lot. I think. They all eat cheese, even the little humans. That is never explained, along with the fact that the mice wear running shoes. Anyway, one day their supply of cheese is taken away. The two mice scurry and sniff their way to finding some new cheese. But Hem screams: ""Who moved my cheese?""Haw suggests to his friend ""maybe we need to change and do things differently"", but Hem says: ""Why should we change. We're Littlepeople.

21,Paul McKenna shares his 'proven' love strategy -and how to deal with heartbreak;Hypnotist and behavioural scientist Paul McKenna has lifted the lid on the secrets to romance success in his new book Seven Things That Make or Break a ­Relationship,"February 14, 2020 Friday",International,mirror.co.uk,1131,1131,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,"By, Paul McKenna",Paul McKenna shares his 'proven' love strategy -and how to deal with heartbreakHypnotist and behavioural scientist Paul McKenna has lifted the lid on the secrets to romance success in his new book Seven Things That Make or Break a ­Relationship,"Relationships are critical to our happiness and enjoyment of life.I want to empower everyone with the knowledge that relationships can be transformed and to offer strategies to make this change possible.I had to make an awful lot of mistakes in my life, over and over again for many years, to learn this. And now, in my book Seven Things That Make or Break a ­Relationship, I am ready to reveal my scientifically proven love strategy using the power of your conscious and unconscious mind.A rich, rewarding relationship is one of the greatest sources of happiness in the world. But relationships that are stuck in negativity cause suffering and sadness.The techniques you are about to learn will re-code the habits of your conscious mind. And the good news is that the system works for everyone - even those who have given up hope...When I was a young man, I had my heart broken, so my ­unconscious mind began preventing me from getting really close to anyone.I wasn't deliberately trying to wreck my relationships but my mind was repeating the protective action even when I no longer needed it and until it was programmed into my behaviour. It was a form of self-protection.I described myself as ""commitment phobic"" and, in 2012, I told an interviewer: ""I'm not built for relationships.""I didn't have a problem getting together with women but I did not seem to be able to make a relationship last.As this pattern emerged, I developed two unhelpful beliefs. In the first I saw myself as the victim of a pattern: I could not stop choosing the wrong woman.In the second I believed I could not stop myself sabotaging my own happiness. My unconscious mind knew I had been hurt in the past and it manufactured disagreements so that we would split up before it became too painful.One day a good friend pointed out to me that the common denominator in all my relationship problems was me. It was me who needed to change.Later I was to discover that even more powerful changes were at work.When I came across the love strategy, it was a complete revelation. Up until then I constantly wondered why I was trying so hard to show the other person that I really cared about them.Things I said or did had no impact, no matter how hard or often I tried.It was so frustrating, as though I was speaking another language.I remember being mystified at how I seemed to cause offence even when I was being grateful.""Don't you like it"" she said - after giving me a gift.""Of course I do,"" I replied. ""I'm going to put it somewhere special later.""""So you don't like it"" came the reply.Then I learned the love strategy and everything changed. I was able to communicate how I felt and I was understood.I realised that the person who gave me that gift was visual. She expected me to look at it, examine it and put it right in front of me.It also became clear that my own preferred mode of thinking is auditory. This means that while I am grateful for a gift, I am truly touched if a person tells me in a meaningful, authentic way that they love me.The following techniques are deceptively simple but will make all the difference in the world to the intimacy in your relationships, as they did to me.                     How your partner thinks                   Listen carefully. Do they predominantly use words to paint pictures If so, they are probably ""visual"". Do they enjoy talking or listening to music If so, they are probably ""auditory"". People with a ""kinaesthetic"" or tactile preference will say ""Let's touch upon this"" or ""That feels good"".Notice the direction in which people tend to look when searching their memory to answer questions. Visuals tend to look up, auditory to the side and kinaesthetic downwards.When you have established their preferred mode, begin to attune your language to theirs so they feel understood and appreciated.                     For visual partners...                   Use visual metaphors in your lan­­guage. Show your love with acts of ser­­vice and visible gifts like flowers, paintings and written messages.Use your phone to send them pictures and photos. Take them to the cinema and to beautiful places.                     For auditory partners...                   Use auditory metaphors in your language. Show your love by telling them meaningfully about what you appreciate about them. Find out what sort of music they like and find more of it. When you agree with them, don't just nod but offer positive verbal affirmation.                     For kinaesthetic partners...                   Show your love with hugs and touches. Buy them presents that are rewarding to hold and to use. Join them in physical activities such as walking, dancing, tennis or sailing.We all use all modes to some extent, so when you have an important message to convey you will have maximum impact when you talk to the person in a direct and meaningful tone, look them in the eye and touch them in an ­appropriate way.And if you are receiving a gift or an important emotional communication, hold the gift or touch the person in an appropriate way, look at the gift carefully or look at the person as you say something thoughtful and appreciative.Your attention is a form of energy and it is one of the most powerful gifts you have. The more you pay attention, the richer your relationship will become.And take your phone off the table - it takes your attention even by the ­possibility of alerts.Keep flirting, even long after you have agreed to be in a relationship. It is fun and leads to better sex, which is perhaps the nicest form of communication. There is a psychologist in Seattle who can predict with 90 per cent accuracy, and after just 20 minutes of conversation, whether a couple will stay together.Dr John Gottman, of the Gottman Institute, has spent the past 40 years analysing the conversations of couples and has discovered the four actions that create happy, long-lasting relationships.Happy couples are good at listening. They give time and attention to their partner and make an effort to understand them.He also discovered that many of the actions and things we say to our partner are bids for attention.If you hold out your hand to your partner and they take it, this feels good. It feels bad if they don't. A flat response when you greet your partner after work feels bad; a warm reply feels good.Gottman also noticed that couples who get on well express their admiration for each other regularly.In short, if you think or feel it: say it. He also observed that happy couples express optimism.Noticing and commenting on the good things in life doubles the pleasure of the original observation and nourishes our loving bonds in profound ways.•Extracted by Jane Warren from Seven Things That Make or Break a ­Relationship by Paul McKenna, Bantam Press, £14.99.",Newspaper; Web Publication

Don't believe me? That may be even greater proof that you would excel.Investing can seem like an intimidating business, encrusted as it is with jargon, and bloated with experts and professionals making a fortune from it. But there is no reason to be put off: a nimble, beginner investor even has some advantages over the professionals.Here are five reasons why you may be better than the experts.1. Sitting tight can work very wellSometimes the best investment strategy is to sit tight and see what happens. After all, it's very hard to predict how markets will fluctuate in the short term and investing is for the long term.Doing nothing and not reacting to market movements can be much easier if you're not overly confident - a lack of conviction that you know which way markets will go next or how to respond can lead to inertia.As our confidence grows, it gets harder not to meddle. We start to think that we know better than others and so start to change our portfolios based on our predictions - misguided or not. And making quick changes will be unlikely to produce a good outcome on balance.Jessica Exton, behavioural scientist at financial services group ING, says: 'We naturally tend to be over-confident in our abilities, which can result in making frequent changes to our investment strategy. 'It has also been found to encourage us to take on higher levels of investment risk, if we believe we can predict what will happen in the market more accurately than others.'Both these tendencies can lead to lower investment performance in the long run. Overconfidence has also been found to increase with investing experience and education. 'This suggests that those without a lot of experience in the stock market may be less likely to frequently change their strategy and avoid over-reacting to short-term market fluctuations.'A study by professors Brad Barber and Terrance Odean at the University of California laid bare the cost of overconfidence leading to overtrading. James Norton, senior investment planner at financial giant Vanguard, explains: 'Over a six-year period, Barber and Odean carried out detailed research on more than 78,000 US brokerage accounts, analysing over three million trades. 'Specifically, they wanted to understand how investment returns differed for the 20 per cent of investors who traded the most compared to the 20 per cent who traded the least.'The results were shocking. The confident, frequent traders achieved returns of 11.4 per cent a year compared to 18.5 per cent for the less active traders. 'To put this into perspective, £1,000 invested at the beginning of the period would have grown to more than £2,700 after six years for the active traders, compared to more than £4,000 for the infrequent traders.'Interestingly, the professors also found that women traded less frequently than men and consequently had better returns.'2. Why keeping it simple will helpFund managers need to attract investors' money and generate fees with theories, investment names and performance figures that make them stand apart. But many will not do any better than cheap, passive funds that are not actively managed. Norton says: 'As an individual investor, you have the licence to keep it simple. A fund manager needs to get assets for their fund or they don't have a job. It's human nature that we tend to like things - especially in investing - that sound more complicated and think they will be better.'There have been trends for particular words to appear in the names of funds: 'alpha', 'plus', 'special'. They make you feel like you've found a good fund.'Though index or passive funds don't have jazzy names, they tend to beat most actively managed funds. You can have a globally diversified portfolio of stocks and bonds in two passive funds - and for around 0.2 per cent a year.'3. You are investing for the long termIndividuals invest for long-term goals - retirement, a deposit for a home, or to gain financial independence. With long-term horizons of at least five years and often decades, we can afford to ride out the highs and the lows.A spell of losses is not the end of the world when you have sufficient time for your portfolio to recover.While most fund managers say they, too, invest for the long-term, in reality many are going to come under pressure if they have periods of poor performance.Thinking practically, a fund won't attract new investment and may see investors withdraw funds if it stops making money for them.A fund manager may have a benchmark or target that they are tasked with outperforming; they may be under pressure to attract new funds by coming up with an interesting-sounding proposition; or to show good performance every quarter which can curb their ability to think long term. This pressure may force professionals to make portfolio changes or attempt to improve short-term performance, missing out on the opportunity to invest in a way that will harvest rewards longer term.After all, some firms take time to grow and start producing good profits. Investors in these sometimes need to play the long game.Lee Wild, head of equity strategy at wealth platform Interactive Investor, says: 'As an individual, if your investments return say 5 per cent above inflation, you may be happy. If you're a professional, this does not look like such a good outcome if your benchmark has returned an excess of 6 per cent.'4. No need to worry about taxAs a beginner investor, it's unlikely you'll have to worry about filing tax returns, keeping track of capital gains and messing around with endless paperwork.If you invest in a stocks and shares Isa, there is no tax to pay on any gains that you make while you're investing or when you come to spend them.You can invest up to £20,000 each year in a stocks and shares Isa and don't have to fill in a tax return or alert Revenue & Customs.Later, should you start to breach this amount, there may be tax implications and reliefs to be aware of, which makes things trickier. But your Isa allowance alone could make you into an Isa millionaire in just 17 years, assuming returns of 5 per cent a year.5. You'll be more open mindedDiving into the theories and technicalities of investing can be useful, and of course it's good to understand what you are investing in. But there is an argument that this could lead to more narrow thinking if you're not careful.James Anderson, manager of Scottish Mortgage, the country's largest investment trust, believes investors need to hear a variety of views, and yet this is often not what professionals do. Investing professionals tend to study for the same qualifications, learning the same theories and reading the same materials - leading to an over-dependence on certain ideas.For Anderson, it's the Chartered Financial Analyst course that especially distorts views, with its attachment to value investing - buying shares in firms that look cheap.He says: 'We don't take the view that individual investors are worse investors than institutional ones.'I find by and large that individual investors are both open to more different investment approaches and also are more long term than the bulk of our institutional clients.'So, there's no need to be intimidated - put your lack of confidence to good use - and show the professionals how investing is done.Rachel Rickard Straus is editor of the magazine Moneywise",Web Publication
23,"Economic forecasting is set up for failure, so what is its real value?","February 17, 2020 Monday",International,thetimes.co.uk,661,661,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,Philip Aldrick,"Economic forecasting is set up for failure, so what is its real value?","A year ago, Fathom Consulting audited the International Monetary Fund's forecasts. In 194 countries since 1988 there had been 469 recessions, 79 of them in advanced economies. The IMF foresaw only four a year in advance, Fathom found, and none when it came to rich nations. It did, however, spot 47 that never happened.In 2004, the year ten ""accession countries"" - largely from the former Soviet bloc - joined the European Union, the British government estimated that annual migration to the UK from the new members would total between 5,000 and 13,000. At the upper end, that suggested 156,000 immigrants by 2016. In fact, ten times as many came - 1.6 million.As any economist would tell you, the only forecast they will get right is that their forecast will be wrong. But the examples above, taken from Robert Shiller's                    Narrative Economics                    and                    Radical Uncertainty                   , by John Kay and Mervyn King, were not merely wrong, they were calamitous. Enough, perhaps, to make you agree with Michael Gove, speaking days before the Brexit referendum, that ""people in this country have had enough of experts"".To judge from recent books and developments in the profession, even the experts may have had enough of experts. Economics appears to be in the grip of an existential crisis. The premise of                    Radical Uncertainty                    is that many risks cannot be quantified. There are times, the authors write, when the profession should admit ""we simply do not know"".After the 2008 crisis, ""the masters of the universe"" migrated from Wall Street to the central banks - literally, in the cases of Mario Draghi and Mark Carney, both Goldman Sachs alumni. The height of economic hubris may have been in 2003, when Robert Lucas, the Nobel laureate, said that ""macroeconomics has succeeded . . . depression prevention has been solved"". But the height of its power came in the post-crisis decade.Economics is now showing a little humility. Humans make sense of the world with stories and those narratives are an ""important mechanism for economic change, as well as economic forecasting"", Mr Shiller says. But how do you forecast the impact of an idea that you don't know is about to go viral? Similarly, behavioural economics revealed as flawed the assumption that people act in their own rational self-interest. Yet economists today point to flaws in the assumptions behind behavioural economics. There's an agony in this soul-searching.""We cannot rely on forecasts, but demand for forecasts is insatiable,"" Lord King, the former Bank governor, and Mr Kay write. Many economic models, they say, are ""as fragile as a balsa wood structure in a wind tunnel"". The Treasury's Green Book, which uses a cost-benefit model to make investment decisions that Rishi Sunak, the new chancellor, is overhauling, is a case in point.Travel time is given a ludicrously precise value - £13.57 an hour in a taxi, £7.69 on a bike - to establish the economic value of a rail link. Yet the model assumes the world never changes, that there will be no mass heliports or holographic conferencing. Former Treasury officials say the Green Book evidence is ignored, anyway, if it contradicts political preferences. Why make this kind of ""pretence of knowledge"" only to dismiss it? Doing so erodes ""the confidence of the public in evidence"", Lord King and Mr Kay say.Lord King is dismissive of his successor Mr Carney's forward guidance because it pretends future knowledge that no one has. Economics should be helping people to think more clearly about the world, not using pseudo-science to do the thinking for them, he has argued. Rather than claim omnipotence, economics should advertise its limits, frame arguments and leave judgment to others. To look at Boris Johnson, Dominic Cummings and Donald Trump, it's already happening.                   Philip Aldrick is Economics Editor of The Times                 ",Newspaper; Web Publication
24,"A citizens' assembly on climate is pointless if the government won't listen;A similar set-up broke the political deadlock in Ireland, but the Tories don't want to hear bold recommendations","February 17, 2020 Monday",International,The Guardian (London),1119,1119,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,Stephen Buranyi,"A citizens' assembly on climate is pointless if the government won't listenA similar set-up broke the political deadlock in Ireland, but the Tories don't want to hear bold recommendations","When MPs announced a citizens' assembly on the climate emergency last June, two crucial things hadn't yet happened: Boris Johnson's takeover of the Conservative party; and the subsequent general election campaign where the main opposition parties each offered radical plans to address the climate crisis, and then lost to Johnson, who had offered no plan at all.For everyone hoping for action on climate, the election was a particularly bruising experience. First throwing open the door to a previously unthinkable possibility - immediate, concrete plans to fight the crisis, far beyond anything proposed by the inadequate Paris Agreement - and then, just as quickly, slamming that door shut. Perhaps even more tightly than before, given Johnson's disinterest in all things climate-related. And because now the party without an apparent serious climate plan is in charge of taking the critical first steps towards Theresa May's government's goal of hitting net-zero by 2050, while the parties willing to commit to action are shut out of power by the enormous Tory majority.The climate assembly - which met for the second time in Birmingham last weekend - was created to act as a kind of workaround for traditional partisan deadlock, and to chart a safe route forward for governments to act on the climate crisis. Its conceit is that it offers direct access to the real will of the people: 110 citizens - chosen to be representative of the British population - attend sessions where they are briefed by experts on the issue; they then come up with a set of policies to solve it. A citizens' assembly in Ireland helped the government to put forward the referendum that ended that country's abortion ban last year.The best chance for tackling the climate crisis comes from politicians and parties who don't wait for incremental solutionsThe mood at the assembly so far has been hopeful. The setup assumes that our political leaders have the best intentions, but are paralysed by indecision, both because of the unfathomable number of options and the fear that the public will punish them for the wrong choice. The whole function of politics here is outsourced to the public: they're asked to make their own tough decisions. And so they have sat attentively listening to presentations on the greatest hits of never-tried climate policy, and have been asked to weigh them up. There was mention of personal carbon allowances (be your own carbon market), a very popular idea in 2008, and more recent schemes such as creating nationwide repair networks, and forcing manufacturers to build goods to last.All the solutions presented reflect the mainstream of British climate policy over the past two decades. The experts put forward a fairly cautious mix of technocratic market incentives and regulation, with large spending programmes reserved for infrastructure projects. Still, there were signs that the assembly might take some bold decisions. The experts barely mentioned free public transport, yet were quizzed on it incessantly. And the members wanted to know who was most responsible for emissions, and how they could be made to pay. The polls suggest that public opinion has leapt ahead of the government's climate ambition over the past year, and it's possible that the assembly recommendations will confirm that.But even if the assembly puts the most progressive options in front of the government, there's still the sticky question of implementation. ""How can we be sure the government will follow on our recommendations,"" an assembly member asked Labour MP Rachel Reeves, one of only three elected officials in attendance. She didn't have a good answer, but she could easily have told them it's not on her - she's only ever been in opposition during her 10-year tenure in parliament. The assembly's most valuable contribution may be breaking the deadlock between equally effective but controversial policies - a land-use carbon tax or a consumption tax, for example - although the Tories may well choose neither. The problem with how to tackle the climate crisis in the UK is not partisan deadlock, but lack of government interest.A citizens' assembly can't change that. Its decisions aren't guaranteed to sway the government from its prearranged course. The Irish assembly is held up as a model for its recommendations on the abortion referendum. However, it also submitted proposals on the climate crisis, from huge investments in peat restoration and public transport to a tax on agriculture emissions. The Irish government ignored all of these, in favour of what the prime minister, Leo Varadkar, called ""ambitious but realistic"" policies to ""nudge people to change behaviour"". Nudging people towards radical change is a depressing continuation of the managerial away-day optimism that has dominated thinking on the climate crisis over the past 20 years. One would have better luck trying to nudge a stream back up a mountain.Instead, the best chance for tackling the crisis comes from politicians and parties who don't wait for incremental solutions. Party politics has become an unexpected laboratory for fusing climate policies to big, popular, social spending programmes - based on the model of a green new deal, which was first put forward by experts in 2008. Unlike a sitting government, opposition policy shops are a frictionless environment: ambition can be doubled and redoubled without pushback.And if the programmes capture the public attention, they are quickly copied by other parties. Labour proposed a green industrial revolution based on using the resources of the state to foster green industries, creating jobs and increasing living standards. This in turn pushed the Liberal Democrats to try to match the offer - remarkable for a party committed to the decentralisation of state power. In the US, the Bernie Sanders campaign is not only currently leading the polls to win the Democratic nomination with the            Green New Deal as a top-line policy, it has also pushed every other candidate towards embracing the idea - something that would have seemed impossible just four years ago. For a long time it has been assumed that public opinion is a barrier to climate action. But the climate assembly will likely confirm what the polls have been indicating for the past year: that people are now ready to move further and faster on climate action than the minimal effort shown by the government. If their advice is ignored or diluted beyond recognition, then maybe citizens' assemblies are an imperfect mechanism for the scale of change needed to tackle the climate crisis. Only a green new deal for the UK will do. Stephen Buranyi is a writer specialising in science and the environment",Newspaper
25,How to beat your workphone addiction;OFFICE POLITICS ; Always-on culture can be a double-edged sword - here's what we can do about it,"February 19, 2020 Wednesday",International,City A.M.,615,615,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,Carolyn Lorian,How to beat your workphone addictionOFFICE POLITICS ; Always-on culture can be a double-edged sword - here's what we can do about it,"THE RIGHT to ignore work emails at home recently made headlines during the Labour leadership race. It has been mooted that workers should be given the right to ignore work messages outside of hours in order to end the 24/7 work culture and protect mental health.Smartphones have made emails and work messages omnipresent. For many, this is a godsend - particularly if you are working around childcare needs, in a flexible role, or spending a large part of the day in meetings.However, for many others, access to work communications around the clock has had a detrimental impact, adding to the always-on, high-pressure workplace culture. People are continuing to work when they are not at their most productive, with leaveism (using annual leave when you are actually too unwell to go to work) and presenteeism enabled by technology. Among young people in particular, it seems to be a growing problem.Research from Deloitte's Mobile Consumer Survey highlights that the use of smartphones for business purposes outside of working hours is rising, especially among the UK's youngest workers. The proportion of employees aged 18-24 who said they check work emails outside of hours very often has almost doubled in the last year, from 12 per cent to 21 per cent. Around one in six workers aged 18-24 check work emails every hour, compared to just one in 20 workers aged over 55.With 73 per cent of young people now doing work outside of their contracted hours, the concern is that this will set the precedent of managing the work-life balance for generations to come. Not only could this lead to huge productivity issues, but it could pose serious threats to both mental and physical health down the line.Research published last month reflects how poor mental health costs UK employers up to £45bn a year. Young people were found to be the most vulnerable, with workers aged 18-29 less likely to disclose mental health problems to employers and more likely to use their holiday allowance instead of taking days off.How can the problem be tackled? Smartphone makers, businesses, and device users will all be responsible for ensuring that the technology helps rather than hinders our working lives.Some organisations and governments are switching off access to systems entirely between certain times. In France, it is illegal to expect employees to email after hours.Most smartphones now have built-in tools to monitor use that can help to understand our usage and track screen time. However, whether these extreme measures will be successful in minimising longer impacts on device users is debatable.The UK workforce's dependence on communicating out-of-hours makes an all-out ban on their use unlikely. A more sustainable halfway house would be to encourage a culture that does not make work communications after hours the norm.Small behavioural nudges, such as adding a simple email signature, can be effective, for instance stating that while it suits the sender to sometimes email out of hours, they do not expect a response before the start of the next working day.Ultimately, the solution requires educating and empowering people to manage their relationship with their devices. What may be helpful to one person may be damaging to another; one size does not fit all.In past generations, the detrimental impact of reading, homework, and even crosswords has been suggested, and in future the debate over the harms of smartphone use for working out-of-hours may be mocked too. But we need to establish a working culture that ensures that the devices have a positive impact on productivity, rather than cause office burnout.£ Dr Carolyn Lorian is a workplace wellbeing consulting lead at Deloitte.",Newspaper
26,Criminal Minds star Matthew Gray Gubler shares poignant photo as crime drama ends after 15 seasons,"February 20, 2020 Thursday",International,MailOnline,349,349,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,Rachel Mcgrath For Dailymail.com,Criminal Minds star Matthew Gray Gubler shares poignant photo as crime drama ends after 15 seasons,"CBS drama Criminal Minds came to an end Wednesday night after 15 seasons.And ahead of the two-part finale that aired in back-to-back episodes, series star Matthew Gray Gubler posted a poignant message to fans on social media.The actor, 39, who played Dr. Spencer Reid, shared a photo showing his FBI badge, pistol, watch and desk nameplate, and wrote: 'I've carried these 3 props with me almost every day for the last 15 years.''After tonight i'll just carry them in my heart where i will forever keep memories of the best crew, the best cast, and the best fands (fans/friends) a fictional crimefighter could ever have.'Gubler was one of the original seven main castmembers when the show premiered in September 2005.The series centered in the FBI's Behavioral Analysis Unit (BAU) and the profilers who work there, using behavioral analysis to investigate crimes. The cast underwent several major changes during its 15 seasons but Gubler, along with A. J. Cook, and Kirsten Vangsness, went the distance.In an interview with TVLine, published Wednesday, Gubler reminisced: 'I got to be in the very last shot of the entire series, which was a nice bookend because when we shot the pilot, I remember, I was in the very first shot that we ever did of the entire series.'He was philosophical about having to say goodbye to something that's been such a large part of his life. 'I know that everything has its time and I'm in no way sad that the show is closing, because I feel like we've done it beautifully, and I feel like there are roots there for it to re-hatch later,' he explained.Gubler also hinted that fans of the show might not have heard the last of Dr. Spencer Reid.'I kind of liken it to if you go to a concert, at a certain point the band has to leave the stage in order to have an encore. It's just the natural progression,' he teased.

They said the best thing for me to do was to lose weight.""I didn't want to join a gym or any of the slimming groups as they didn't appeal to me.""My son Joshua is autistic and needs a lot of care. He was one of the reasons why it was important to become healthier.""After signing up to the digital-focused plan, Lynne was a set of 'smart' scales and an activity tracker that links with the app, allowing her to monitor her weight-loss progress and daily step count.She was also sent a recipe book, a meal plan and daily motivational articles, and was added to an online peer support group -hosted by a qualified dietitian offering daily advice.The digital aspect meant she still had the motivation to shed the pounds without having to stand up in front of a room of strangers and talk about her weight.She said: ""I lost weight straight away. It's really easy to stick to and because I'm eating healthily, my husband, Lee, is too -he's lost two stone.""The biggest change I've made is creating meal plans and sticking to the meals, using their recipes and keeping a food diary.""She swapped fast food for freshly cooked dishes, including a number of delicious treats like chocolate-covered desserts, muffins and curries. She was also told that nothing was off limits, meaning she could treat herself to the odd glass of wine.She said: ""I really don't feel as though I'm missing out on anything -and I've cooked things I wouldn't normally cook. The things we do like eating, we've found an alternative way of cooking them, or substituted it with something else.""There's nothing you can't have as long as you have it in moderation or that you're very mindful that what you're having is a treat.""On a Friday night, my husband and I will sometimes have a bottle of wine with our neighbours or we'll enjoy a takeaway -I will choose a healthier option though.""I've given some of my recipes to my father-in-law, who is diabetic, and my mother-in-law who is at risk -and she's lost 12lbs.""Lynne also started walking every day, slowly at first, beginning with 3,500 steps, gradually increasing it to 10,000 over the duration of the 12-week programme.Lynne has stopped an incredible 5st and now weighs 16st 7lbs, saying the weightloss has also helped ease the pain of the arthritis she has in her knee.She's also bought herself a dog, and walking Aubrey gives her a reason to get out exercising over the weekend.She said: ""I've wanted a dog all my married life, but my husband always used to say that I would never walk it or take care of it. But after I'd lost a couple of stone, he agreed that I could get a puppy.""I have a beautiful chocolate labrador called Aubrey -she's 18 weeks now and she is taken for walks all the time. Having a dog helps me to get out at the weekend.""My son is overweight too -because of his autism, he has a very restricted diet and we have to stick to very specific things. So it's been great for us to take the dog out together for a couple of hours.""I'm now much more active with him over the weekends. But life hasn't hugely changed -which is a good thing. It just means I have the peace of mind of knowing I will be around for a lot longer for Josh -and be healthier around him.""I've just had my yearly check up and the results from my blood tests is perfect -my sugar levels are fine and I'm no longer at risk of type-2 diabetes.""Second Nature was set up by Chris Edson and Mike Gibbs - both former NHS advisors - to tackle Britain's obesity and type-2 diabetes epidemic.The programme, which offers an effective alternative to fasting, calorie counting and points-based diets, has so far amassed 30,000 users and is also being trialled by the NHS.Chris Edson, co-founder of Second Nature, said: ""We've used our research and insights to create an app that helps you rewire your habits.""Using smart behavioural science, our app makes it easy for you to form new habits, ones that help you sleep better, eat better and feel better. Habits that help you lose weight, and keep it off.""As habit experts, we know the key to changing them successfully is keeping it up, long-term. So, we stay by your side, in your pocket, helping you keep up these positive changes for good.""In the end, you'll find you're not trying to lose weight, you're not depriving yourself or counting calories, you're just living better, automatically, every day.""

28,"HAMISH MCRAE: Want to be a real populist, Boris? Scrap the 45p top tax rate and do something popular for a change","February 22, 2020 Saturday",International,MailOnline,716,716,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,"Hamish Mcrae, Financial Mail On Sunday","HAMISH MCRAE: Want to be a real populist, Boris? Scrap the 45p top tax rate and do something popular for a change","Populist governments are supposed to do things which are popular, not things that are unpopular. There is a danger Boris Johnson's Government has already forgotten this.Of course, governments have to pass laws that enable them to run the show, and sometimes there have to be penalties for non-compliance. But they also have to encourage people, to help them achieve their aims in a way that benefits society as a whole. The Cameron Government was not without fault, but it understood the need for this when it created the Nudge Unit.The unit is now a social purpose company called the Behavioural Insights Team, part-owned by the Government, and which helps advise other governments as well. Success stories include prescription forms so that doctors make fewer mistakes when filling them out, and increasing the number of Britons who have joined the NHS organ donor register by asking people whether there would be a donor for them if they needed a transplant.But now look at what is happening. Last week, the Government announced it would ban sales of coal and unseasoned wood for fires and stoves. The reason is that these increase local air pollution, something quite rightly the Government wants to tackle. But anyone who bought a wood-burning stove thinking they were doing the right thing by using a renewable fuel might feel a bit upset.Burning unseasoned wood is indeed bad for our environment (and for our chimneys), but there must be a better way of nudging people to use dry wood than a blanket ban on sales of wet stuff.Or take the switch to electric cars. Last summer the incoming Transport Secretary, Grant Shapps, said he wanted to use the Nudge Unit to find ways of pushing people towards buying them.Now, a few months into office, he strikes a rather different note. Instead of gently guiding us, perhaps by finding ways to make charging easier, he says that all cars sold in Britain will have to be electric by 2035, or maybe 2032.That's bossing, not nudging, and understandably this has caused resentment. Those are warning signs. The first big test of the tone of this Government - whether it is populist or authoritarian - comes soon in the Budget next month. Of course the new Chancellor, Rishi Sunak, has to make the numbers add up. They are OK at the moment, but only OK. The latest public tax and spending numbers last week showed that the deficit is going to be around £44billion, which is a bit lower than the Office for Budget Responsibility projected but a bit higher than last year. So there is a bit of headroom, but no scope for huge tax cuts or huge increases in spending. Mr Sunak has to be careful.But - and this really matters - he also has to be popular. It seems that some really unpopular ideas, such as slashing pension tax relief, have now been junked. Given that we all have to save much more for our futures, that would have made no sense at all. Actually, pensions are one of the areas where a nudge (with a legal push behind it) has worked really well. Auto-enrolment has boosted the number of people in workplace pensions from 7.7million in 2017 to ten million last year. So while pensions certainly need reforms, you don't want to wreck what is in general a success story.My own populist measure would be to drop the top 45 per cent income tax rate back to 40 per cent. It would cost nothing and might even bring in more revenue as some people would no longer keep their income down to avoid it.Crucially, it would give a signal that it wants people to do well.Others will have their own ideas as to what will be popular, and the Government would be wise to listen. That's the core of it. Back in 1946 the Attorney General, Hartley Shawcross, made the infamous assertion in parliament about the new Labour Government that was compressed into the phase 'we are the masters now'.It became such a resonant, toxic view of government that both Tony Blair and Boris Johnson went out of their way on taking office to assert the opposite: The people are the masters and the politicians are the servants.The trouble is that this is what political leaders say, but what they actually end up doing feels rather different. Come the Budget on March 11 we will learn whether this Government really thinks of itself as a servant of the people who voted for it, or not.",Web Publication
29,GPs pioneer a way to break their opioid habit;A programme that 'nudges' doctors to prescribe exercise and physiotherapy is weaning patients off painkillers,"February 22, 2020 Saturday",International,thetimes.co.uk,499,499,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,"Andrew Gregory, Health Editor",GPs pioneer a way to break their opioid habitA programme that 'nudges' doctors to prescribe exercise and physiotherapy is weaning patients off painkillers,"A pioneering NHS trial has dramatically reduced the number of powerful opioids given to patients.More than five million people a year in England are prescribed potentially addictive painkillers, with 540,000 hooked for three years or more. Last year official data showed that a doubling of NHS prescriptions for the opioids oxycodone and fentanyl had contributed to a rise of more than 400% in deaths linked to the drugs.The trial in eight GP surgeries across the Midlands, led by experts at Keele University, produced remarkable results. In seven days, doctors cut the number of opioids prescribed per patient by 17%. In six months, prescriptions fell by a fifth.""Changing the routine behaviour of any healthcare professional is tough, so the reduction in opioid prescribing is surprising,"" said Professor Nadine Foster, who led the trial. Funded by the National Institute for Health Research, a government agency, it aimed to test an approach called ""stratified care"", which offers patients personalised treatment.GPs often turn to medication as a first resort for musculoskeletal pain. About a third of patients are prescribed opioids. Jonathan Hill, a senior lecturer at Keele, said that while these are mainly short courses of weak opioids, ""people too often progress from being given short courses of weak opioids to longer-acting, stronger opioids over time, which are known to have greater harms and addiction problems"".In the trial, patients with back, knee, shoulder or neck pain answered nine questions about their pain and its impact. They received a score calculating their risk of persistent, disabling pain.For patients rated low and medium risk, opioids were no longer among the options available to the GP. Those at low risk were offered over-the-counter drugs or given advice on weight loss and activity levels. Patients deemed at medium risk were offered physiotherapy, exercise programmes or referrals to pain clinics.""The list of options on the computer screen essentially reminds the GP to do the right thing with the patient, right there in the room. Helping to nudge clinical behaviour in the right direction in real time as decisions are being made is as good as it gets,"" explained Foster.Opioids came up as an option for patients at high risk of persistent, disabling pain only alongside options such as injections or a referral for surgery.Hill said another ""encouraging"" finding was that despite cutting down on opioids, patients did not return more frequently to their GP. The trial has now been expanded to more than 5,000 patients in 24 GP surgeries.Family doctors say that in some areas, while they wish to prescribe fewer opioids, there are no alternatives, and the waiting lists for options such as physiotherapy are long.Hill said: ""Our new approach is about nudging GPs to consider early referral to these treatment services for those patients who need it. It is not about increasing the total number of patients referred to these other services.""@AndrewGregory",Web Publication
30,The puzzle of managing money;Bobby Seagull Serious Money,"February 22, 2020 Saturday",International,"Financial Times (London, England)",1098,1098,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,,The puzzle of managing moneyBobby Seagull Serious Money,"Solving puzzles - as a mathematician, and quiz show enthusiast - is what rocks my world.So this financial conundrum posed by FT reader Peter Staunton intrigued me - what drives our often inefficient desire to compartmentalise our money? One of the winners of my FT Christmas Maths Quiz, Peter's tiebreaker suggested this topic for a Christmas Lecture, based on the hidden power of personal finances (I had a cameo role in the 2019 Royal Institution Christmas Lectures hosted by Dr Hannah Fry on the hidden power of maths).The father of two boys, Peter said he was struck by the number of parents who save to fund their children's education.Many use cash accounts bearing a low interest rate for these long-term savings, but simultaneously pay much higher rates on their own shortdated debts. This is illogical and on a par with borrowing money to invest in savings. So why do parents do it? Latest HMRC statistics show more parents open Junior Isas ( Jisas) for their children. In the 2017-18 tax year, there was a 14 per cent increase in new accounts, with a record £902m of our hard-earned cash stashed away. However, 57 per cent of that total was saved into cash Isas.Considering that the lock-up on a Jisa account could be as long as 18 years, the return on cash is unlikely to beat stock market investments.When the Junior Isa was launched on November 1 2011, the annual subscription limit was £3,600 (it's risen to £4,236 today).If you had opened one of the first accounts for your child and put £3,600 in a global tracker such as the Legal &General International Index Fund on day one, it would be worth £10,131 today. That's a tax-free gain of just over £6,500.Sarah Coles, the personal finance analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown who crunched these numbers, also looked at how the top-rated cash Jisas would have performed - and the answer is not a number you'll like.The Coventry Building Society Junior Isa launched soon after the Jisa was born, offering interest rates that have consistently topped the best-buy tables (currently 3.6 per cent interest).Even so, she calculates that an initial ""investment"" of £3,600 would be worth £4,718 today - and a gain of just £286 once you take inflation into account.""Even though Junior Isas offer higher interest rates than are available elsewhere, £286 over nine years isn't the kind of growth parents dream of,"" she says.In her opinion, parents choose cash over stocks and shares, because, when it comes to their kids, they're hard-wired to avoid risk. ""The trouble is that they're focusing on the short-term risk of market volatility, rather than the long-term potential for investment growth. Over a period of 18 years, that's an awful lot of potential growth to miss out on.""Other examples of financial compartmentalising include people with thousands stashed away in cash savings who pay a higher rate of interest on their mortgage, credit card debts or overdraft (when the new 40 per cent bank charges kick in this spring, make sure this does not apply to you!) Mental accounting is one reason why we do this, according to Tim Harford, the FT's Undercover Economist. We recently had a chat about the 2017 Nobel laureate in economics, Richard Thaler, known for his work on mental accounting.Tim's view is that mental accounting is a ""psychological tendency we seem to have that most people intuitively know about"" although Thaler was particularly successful at highlighting it.In Thaler's work, he refers to an interview with actors Gene Hackman and Dustin Hoffman. Harking back to their days as penniless young actors in Los Angeles, Hackman recalled when Hoffman asked to borrow money.In Hoffman's apartment, there were jars labelled ""rent"", ""electricity"", ""food"" and more, denoting various household expenses. The jars were stuffed with cash apart from the empty ""food"" one, which Hoffman obviously wanted to fill. But to avoid eviction, the rent and electricity bills had to be paid, so those jars were filled first.Thaler explained: ""You can think of mental accounting as dumb, as violating the economist's basic assumption that money is fungible."" But from a more pragmatic outlook, mental accounting might help us prioritise spending and saving.This urge is well evidenced in the modern financial world. Digital banks such as Monzo offer savings pots for customers to segregate cash for specific goals, and the ""envelope system"" of allocating cash for specific purposes is gaining traction among Instagram's financial community.This is sensible for those on a tight budget - but what about the wealthy? Cold rationality suggests they should treat money as fungible. But Ruth Sturkey, a chartered financial planner from Paradigm Norton, says from some compartmentalising ""is an absolute lifesaver"" as it helps them to feel ""prepared and organised"".""Most human beings are not as rational as we like to think we are,"" she says, noting this is where a financial planner can help.Unlike the answers to my maths questions in school, she argues: ""Financial planning is an art, not a science.""She talks to her clients about their money by getting them to visualise three pots for their short, medium and long-term goals, which can each be populated based on their individual needs.As we've seen with the Junior Isa example above, if small amounts are placed into the long-term pot early on, they can compound impressively over time. But if someone in their 50s has neglected their long-term savings, then a greater proportion of their income will need to be diverted.Tim Harford sums up: ""Thaler's point is that we're going to do stupid things anyway, and that mental accounting harnesses [that urge] to make less stupid choices.""Although our winner Peter Staunton is admittedly not a psychologist, he enjoys learning about how we are not rational beings and how this ""translates into biases in our decision-making processes"".We can be guilty, Peter says, of looking at ""pensions, mortgages, savings, credit cards, insurance all as disparate items"" so that we can more easily deal with them, rather than consider them holistically.But money is money, no matter what label you have stuck on to the jar. You could unlock some of the hidden power of your own personal finances by taking some time to puzzle over the bigger picture.Bobby Seagull is a maths teacher and the author of 'The Life-Changing Magic of Numbers'.

Slimmers download the app on their mobile or tablet and receive a fitness tracker and 'smart scales' through the post.The tracker records how much steps and sleep someone is getting and pings that data to the application. Whenever the user weighs themselves on the smart scales, that information is also sent to the app.Dieters then enter what they have eaten at breakfast, lunch and dinner - as well as any snacks.All of this information is used to form immediate visual evidence of weight loss, including bar charts and graphs. Slimmers also have access to healthy recipes and daily articles covering topics like meal planning, how to sleep better, how to overcome emotional eating and tips on how to be more active and burn more calories.They can text back and forth with a group of 14 other dieters on the app for motivation and support.Users also have access to a nutritionist every day who is on hand to give them advice and answer questions. The experts can be contacted every day for one on one advice, support and motivation via the app. Throughout the three-month programme, people have access to healthy recipes and daily articles covering topics like meal planning, how to sleep better, and how to overcome emotional eating.The Second Nature diet is now being trialled by 50 clinical commissioning groups across the NHS.So far GPs have prescribed the therapy to around 2,500 patients whose weight puts them at risk of type two diabetes. Around 20,000 private customers have also signed up to the scheme.Analysis by its creators on 10,000 men and women showed dieters lost an average of 5.9kg (0.9 stone) after 12 weeks.And separate research on almost 900 dieters, published in the Journal of Medical Internet Research (JMIR), found they lost an average of 7kg (1.1 stone) over six months and 6.1kg (0.96 stone) after a year.Second Nature experts say the tech helps people 'rewire' unhealthy habits.And they suggest it may also prevent the onset of type 2 diabetes because the average weight lost exceeded 5 per cent of total bodyweight.Doctors say this is the minimum amount of weight loss needed to prevent or delay the onset of the disease.Chris Edson, CEO of Second Nature, said: 'Using smart behavioural science, our app makes it easy for you to form new habits that help you sleep better, eat better and feel better.'Habits that help you lose weight, and keep it off, rather than worrying about constantly counting calories, following points or cutting out certain food types.'Lynne Gaskell, 54, from Lancashire, was referred to Second Nature by her doctor after health checks revealed she was pre-diabetic.She lost more than five stone in five months - and reversed her condition.'My doctor said the best thing for me was to lose weight. But I didn't want to join a gym or any of the slimming groups as they didn't appeal to me,' she said.'Second Nature is app-driven, with smart scales, and you can join online chat groups for support, so it really suited me.'The eating plan is really easy to stick to - and I lost weight straight away.'HOW MANY CALORIES DO I NEED EACH DAY?   The basic amount of calories an average adult needs per day is 2,000kcal for women or 2,500kcal for men.This is based on the amount of energy the body needs to carry out basic functions and to walk and work throughout the day.People who exercise a lot need to eat more calories to fuel their efforts, and young people and children burn more energy, too.If you eat more calories than you burn in a day, you will get fatter.Eating fewer calories than you burn will make you lose weight.Foods which are processed and have high levels of carbohydrate, sugar and salt have higher calorie numbers than fresh fruit and vegetables.Example calorie counts include:•A McDonald's Big Mac contains 508kcal•A two-finger KitKat contains 106kcal•A banana contains 95kcal•An apple contains 47kcalSource: NHS",Web Publication

The diet, called ""Second Nature"", aims to help people ""rewire"" their unhealthy lifestyle habits - which can prevent the potentially life-threatening condition            type 2 diabetes.Users receive a wearable tracker, linked to an app and smart scales, allowing them to track their weight loss and step count.They are also placed in a peer support group with 14 other dieters starting the course, who are coached by a qualified dietitian or nutritionist, who provides participants with daily 1:1 advice, support and motivation to via the app.And research has now revealed that the app may be more effective at helping people shed the pounds than popular slimming groups including WW - formerly known as Weight Watchers - and            Slimming World.Research on 896 Second Nature participants, published in the Journal of Medical Internet Research, found they lost an average of one stone (7.12kg) in over six months - almost all of which stayed off six months later.And separate new analysis focusing on a group of 10,000 men and women on its programme showed they lost an average of just under a stone (5.9kg) - or a 6.7 per cent average weight loss - over a 12-week period.Crucially, the average weight lost exceeded 5 per cent of total body weight, which diabetes experts say is the minimum figure needed to prevent or delay the onset of type 2 diabetes - which affects more than five million people in Britain.By comparison, a study of 1,267 adults on a Weight Watchers course published in the Lancet in 2017 showed an average weight-loss of 4.75kg over 12-weeks, while a 2015 analysis of more than 1.3 million dieters using the Slimming World programme shed an average 3.9kg over the same timeframe.Separate research shows that patients with type 2 diabetes using the Second Nature app significantly lowered their blood sugar level over just three months.In a 2019 study published in the journal Diabetes, Technology and Therapeutics, 40 per cent of participants using Second Nature reduced their HbA1c to below the diagnostic threshold of 48mmol/mol for type-2 diabetes.A high HbA1c means you have too much sugar in your blood and you're more likely to develop diabetes complications.""This research suggests there is now an effective way to transform your life using digital technology in the comfort of your home,"" said Chris Edson, the CEO of Second Nature.""Using smart behavioural science, our app makes it easy for you to form new habits that help you sleep better, eat better and feel better.""Habits that help you lose weight, and keep it off, rather than worrying about constantly counting calories, following points or cutting out certain food types.""

Participants receive a set of 'smart' scales and a wearable activity tracker that links with the app, allowing them to track their weight loss progress and daily step count.They are placed in a peer support group with 14 other participants starting simultaneously. Each group is coached by a qualified dietitian or nutritionist, who provides participants with daily 1:1 advice, support and motivation to via the app.They agree a weight-loss goal and are guided through lifestyle and habit changes over a 12-week programme. Unlike most other weight-loss programmes, no food groups are banned and there is no calorie counting or points.Throughout the 12-week programme, people have access to healthy recipes and daily articles covering topics like meal planning, how to sleep better, and how to overcome emotional eating.Second Nature was set up by Edson and Mike Gibbs - both former NHS advisors - to tackle Britain's obesity and type 2 diabetes epidemic.The scale of the obesity problem in the UK is vast. More than 42 million people are overweight or obese, with five million at high risk for type 2 diabetes.And according to Public Health England, the overall annual cost of obesity to wider society is estimated to almost double from £27 billion to £50 billion by 2050.",Newspaper; Web Publication
33,French police focus on pet of pregnant woman mauled to death by dogs;Elisa Pilarski's dog may have joined attack that prosecutors say probably involved several dogs,"February 25, 2020 Tuesday",International,The Guardian (London),433,433,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,Kim Willsher in Paris,French police focus on pet of pregnant woman mauled to death by dogsElisa Pilarski's dog may have joined attack that prosecutors say probably involved several dogs,"A pregnant woman mauled to death by dogs while walking in woods in northern France may have been attacked by her own pet.The body of Elisa Pilarski, 29, was found covered in bites in a forest near Retz, 55 miles (89 km) north-east of Paris, last November.A postmortem concluded that Pilarski, who was six months pregnant, bled to death after receiving bites to her arms, legs and head.The case has caused anguish and controversy in France, with a pack of dogs out with a local hunt initially blamed for the attack. Investigators took DNA and saliva samples from 67 dogs : five belonging to Pilarski and her partner, Christophe Ellul, and 62 from the local Rallye de la Passion hunt.Police have opened a manslaughter investigation into ""negligence, recklessness, inattention or carelessness"" against persons unknown, a French legal procedure when the culprit has not yet been identified.Now detectives are focusing their attention on Curtis, the couple's two-year-old dog, which Pilarski was out walking when she died. The animal has shown violent behaviour since it was put into kennels while the inquiry is carried out.In a statement on Tuesday, the local public prosecutor Frédéric Trinh said: ""The autopsy report confirmed that Elisa Pilarski's death was the result of haemorrhagic shock following multiple wounds, the characteristics of which suggest the action of one or more likely several dogs with regard to the distribution of the wounds, their differences in morphology and depth.""He said it was not possible to know how many animals had attacked Pilarski as there were ""numerous bites that were mingled in the same area"".Two veterinarians were asked to carry out a behavioural report on Curtis, who is being held in isolation, to see if they were able to match the bites on Pilarski's body and to determine the breed of the dog or dogs involved. According to their report, the dog had several ""skin scrapes"" on its muzzle and face.Trinh said the animal had been involved in two incidents after the attack and that Curtis had ""seized two people by the clothes during the behavioural analysis.

34,CMA sets up behavioural unit to fight for consumers;Competition watchdog,"February 25, 2020 Tuesday",International,"Financial Times (London, England)",328,328,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,KATE BEIOLEY,CMA sets up behavioural unit to fight for consumersCompetition watchdog,"The competition regulator is setting up a ""behavioural hub"" as it seeks to strengthen its credentials as a consumer champion.The Competition and Markets Authority will announce the establishment of the unit today that will draw on economics, data and behavioural science to boost the watchdog's understanding of consumer issues.Andrea Coscelli, chief executive, said the move was part of the watchdog's desire to beef up its role to punish companies that rip off consumers and move away from its old technocratic image.""If we want to keep our legitimacy and licence to operate it is very important that we are perceived not as a technocratic and insular institution but as [an agency] that is involved in markets, understands what consumers are going through and fights for them,"" he said.Last year, Andrew Tyrie, the CMA's chair, demanded new powers to strengthen the watchdog's consumer protection credentials to punish companies that swindle customers.Mr Coscelli said he was ""cautiously optimistic"" that the government would come forward with legislation to allow it to enact faster enforcement action, levy fines and disqualify company directors.He said the benchmark for fines would be the UK's competition regime, which allows for levies of up to 10 per cent of turnover.He added the new unit would help the CMA better ""understand what consumers are going through"" to retain its legitimacy in the eyes of the public.The move would build on the decision to establish a data unit in 2018 to help it flush out issues thrown up by big tech companies such as fake online reviews and algorithms affecting online shopping.Mr Coscelli said the CMA would also be sending its staff to Citizen's Advice Bureau call centres to ""hear directly from consumers with specific problems"" later in the year.""We are not very well known as a competition authority which is a weakness,"" he said. ""There isn't really a sense that we are fighting for the consumer and working for them.""",Newspaper

The hypnotist, 56, from London, married his former PA Kate Davey, in 2016 after following advice from his American life-coach pal who told him to think about who he enjoys spending time with, rather than just physical attraction. He appeared on This Morning today to promote his new book 'Seven Things That Make Or Break a Relationship' and told that his 'subconscious drew a spreadsheet and a graph' that led him to Kate, who happened to love him too. The lifestyle guru previously dated model Clare Staples, who would later act as his manager for nearly 25 years until 2013, when Paul reportedly 'fired' her, and a court case began when she sued for 50 per cent of his estimated £40 million fortune. He said: 'A friend of mine he's a life coach, American, he said ""I notice you date a lot of hot women"". I said, ""Thank you"". ""But you don't like them"". I said, ""Well, what's that got to do with it? They're hot"". 'He said ""No no, stupid thinking"". I said, ""What should I do?"". He said ""Think about, who do you love to be with and who do you find attractive?"". 'So given I'm a hypnotist, I put myself in a trance put these ideas in my head and my subconscious drew a spreadsheet and a graph and it said ""Kate"".' The behavioral scientist told that while it was 'awkward' because the pair had been working together for 25 years, just two-days later they declared their love for each other over a bottle of wine in his kitchen. He said: 'We worked together for about 25 years and I thought, this is awkward, because we have a professional relationship. 'Two days later, we were in my kitchen we were having a bottle of wine, I said ""Tell me something about you that I don't know"". She said, ""I love you"" and I said I felt the same way.' Paul previously told the Daily Mail of his tumultuous legal battle with former partner Staples, who she claimed had become trapped in a 'downward spiral' of addictions to cocaine, alcohol and prescription pills that made her fear he might harm himself or others. 'She wanted half of everything I had and would ever earn,' he said. 'I can only believe it was extortion - pure and simple, based on her wish to destroy me. 'I consider that her actions were based on greed, spite and jealousy. But in the end she had to back down because we had the evidence to prove she was lying.'It has, however, been a monstrous betrayal and I'm still reeling from the shock of it. I can't believe that this is someone I've known for a quarter of a century. It has caused me to question my friendships, my judgment - everything.'You think you know someone, but you find that they have lied and cheated not just you but other people you know. It has crushed me.' Clare Staples, Paul McKenna's ex-fiancée and business partner, said last night: 'Paul was very difficult to live and work with in the last few years we were together and the money I won in the settlement was owed to me for 24 years of hard work as his partner. I have moved on and am much happier and healthier in my new life.' ",Web Publication

'During our assessment of different IoT devices, we got our hands on Cacagoo IP camera, and found vulnerabilities that can not only enable attackers to intercept and view recorded videos, but also to manipulate the device itself as well as other devices within the same network,' wrote researchers in their report.Additionally, researchers found that the cameras, which takes digital video and sends its image data through the internet, did not encrypt audio and video sent through the network.If the company encrypted the data, a hacker with access to the stream of audio and video would have a much harder time actually looking at the stream.Adding to the concern, researchers say they also spotted suspicious activity with the camera transmitting data to an unknown Chinese server.'During our network behavioral analysis of both devices, we observed suspicious behaviour while analysing the YCC365 plus application traffic, which really caught our attention,' they wrote.The leak of that information is not only suspicious but can be considered a security flaw in an of itself, they write.Internet-connected security cams have come under increasing scrutiny over the past year as flaws in popular cameras made by Ring, an Amazon-owned company, have become apparent.A string of highly publicized hacks in which intruders we able to take over Ring cameras were reported late last year.

39,Release the brake to combat climate change,"February 29, 2020 Saturday",International,"Financial Times (London, England)",861,861,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,Tim Harford,Release the brake to combat climate change,"Acouple of years ago, the Nobel-Prize winning psychologist Daniel Kahneman spoke to a distinguished group of social scientists, and shared with them what he regarded as ""the best idea I ever heard in psychology"".The idea derived from Kurt Lewin - described by Prof Kahneman as ""my intellectual grandfather"". Lewin was a great German-born psychologist who - thankfully, given his Jewish origins - escaped to the US in 1933.Lewin described behaviour as a balance between driving forces and restraining forces: the accelerator and the brake, if you will. We often try to change behaviour, especially that of other people, by pushing harder on the accelerator. The proposition that so impressed Prof Kahneman was that it is better to try to release the brake.The vehicular metaphor has seemed particularly apt of late, as my wife and I ponder replacing our disintegrating diesel car. A friend urged us to buy a Tesla: ""Sometimes you just need to do the right thing,"" he opined, although I suspect the ""right thing"" probably involves the bicycle and the train rather than an energy-hungry vehicle perfectly capable of causing accidents and traffic jams. Still, let us accept the premise for the sake of argument. What could induce us to ""do the right thing"" and buy an electric car? The UK government seems to favour loading on the incentives - it taxes fuel and subsidises electric cars to the tune of up to £3,500. But as Lewin might have observed, rather than asking, ""How can I get them to buy an electric car?"", perhaps the British government should be asking, ""What's stopping them?"" What is stopping us, in brief, is a lack of charging points. We live in Oxford and the good news is that Oxford City Council is on the case. The bad news is that they have been on the case since we first contacted them in 2017. They say they plan to install a ""super-rapid charging hub"" at a park-and-ride car park. That won't happen until 2022 and it will be impractically far away - 20 minutes' drive across a congested city.There's a slower charger in the neighbourhood, but that would require parking, walking 10 minutes home, and then walking 10 minutes back again to collect it some hours later - a regular chore we could do without, although I suppose it's no worse than walking a dog.We asked the council if we could run a cable from our house power supply through a drainage channel that already exists. ""Not an idea the council will consent to"", came back the reply, citing a ""dangerous trip hazard"". That leaves us no closer to doing the right thing than we were three years ago. Local councils have been hamstrung by deep spending cuts, and Tim Schwanen of Oxford university's Transport Studies Unit told me that this is by no means just an Oxford problem. Despite Prime Minister Boris Johnson's pledge to make sure that no one is ever more than 30 miles from a charging point, the government's willingness to fund the infrastructure is doubtful. The business model for private charging is unclear. This is not insuperable, but it is a problem nonetheless.And obstacles abound elsewhere: motorway service owners, for example, grumble that the electricity distribution network operators are the bottleneck for fast-charging stations.It is an exciting prospect to think that electric vehicles will unleash the potential of renewable energy sources. Wind and solar offer a clean - and increasingly cheap - way to top up their batteries. Meanwhile a large pool of electric cars, connected to a robust smart grid, could use their batteries to smooth out fluctuations of wind and sun. Affordable electric cars are arriving, but that smart renewable-powered grid still seems some way off.Governments are capable of focusing on brakes rather than accelerators; the question, ""How can we make it easy?"" is at the heart of the ""nudge"" approach to policy. In the spring of 2012, for example, the UK's Department of Energy and Climate Change and the Behavioural Insights Team, known as the ""nudge unit"", experimented with offering some people inexpensive insulation for their attics while others were offered a higher price for insulation but it came coupled with a loft clearance service.For homeowners who opted for clean-up, a crew of workers removed the stuff from the attic, giving the household a chance to go full Marie Kondo. The insulation was installed, and then the crew recycled or donated unwanted items and put back family heirlooms.It was a clever idea, based on the insight that a major obstacle to installing the insulation was not price, but the daunting prospect of sorting through a loft full of junk. Did it work? Quite possibly, but the study was too small and the results too shaky to be sure. The political spotlight moved elsewhere. That is a shame. We should be thinking harder about such opportunities. Too often we are stamping on the accelerator with the handbrake on. When we switch from asking, ""How can I persuade them to do the right thing?"" to, ""Why aren't they doing the right thing already?"", empathy and insight begin to flow.tim.harford@ft.comRather than ask: 'How can I get them to buy an electric car?' We should ask: 'What's stopping them?'",Newspaper

41,Money can't buy you love - but it can buy you happiness;CONSUMER Spending part of your income on others can give a huge boost to your own wellbeing. Marina Gerner reports,"February 29, 2020",International,i - Independent Print Ltd,902,902,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,Marina Gerner,Money can't buy you love - but it can buy you happinessCONSUMER Spending part of your income on others can give a huge boost to your own wellbeing. Marina Gerner reports,"Those who say money cannot buy happiness may not be spending it the right way, say behavioural scientists who analyse how our spending decisions influence our wellbeing. Here, we explain how money can buy happiness - if you follow the right principles.SPEND MONEY ON OTHERS One morning, people on the streets of Vancouver were asked to take part in an experiment by Harvard Business School researchers led by professors Elizabeth Dunn and Michael Norton. Those who agreed to take part received an envelope containing either $5 (£4) or $20 (£15).They were asked how happy they were and instructed to spend the money by 5pm. Crucially, half of the group was told to spend it on themselves, while the other half were told to spend it on somebody else.That evening, each respondent was asked how happy they felt and how they had spent their money.People from the first group had bought themselves coffee, sushi and earrings. The second group had bought toys for younger relatives, given money to homeless people or bought coffee for someone else. How did these purchases make them feel? It turned out that the amount of money in the envelopes didn't matter. Exactly what they bought didn't matter either. What did matter was who they spent it on.Those who were asked to spend money on others were measurably happier at the end of the day than those who spent it on themselves.BUY EXPERIENCES, NOT THINGS Millennials are often said to prefer spending money on experiences over material goods. And research suggests they are on to something.Studies show that spending money on experiences makes us happier than spending it on material goods. According to Thomas Gilovich, a professor of psychology at Cornell University in New York, material things don't define us the way experiences do. Think of an unforgettable play or a trip to see the Northern Lights.""Experiences loom large in the narrative of our life,"" he notes.Telling a compelling story about ourselves is core to wellbeing. What's more, developing skills through experiences gives us pleasure as mastering our environment makes sense from an evolutionary perspective.USE MONEY TO 'BUY TIME' We say that time is money, but is it actually the other way around? Despite rising incomes, people increasingly feel pressed for time, which undermines their wellbeing, according to Ashley Whillans, a professor at Harvard Business School. Once people make more than enough to meet their basic needs, additional money does not bring greater happiness. Yet our choices do not reflect this. Whillans found that the majority of people - including millionaires - tend to prioritise having more money over more time. Whillans then surveyed more than 6,000 working adults and found people ""who spent money on timesaving services reported greater satisfaction"". This includes paying someone else to do disliked household chores such as cleaning. It also means we should think twice before accepting a better paid job with a longer commute, or a marginally cheaper flight that would require more waiting around.THE PERSONALITY TEST Researchers at the University of Cambridge asked 625 participants to fill out a personality test. Then they asked them to ascribe traits to things they might spend money on - like books, coffee, insurance, pets and clothes - as if they were people.Pubs, they decided, are outgoing and a bit impulsive. Home insurance is reserved and dependable. And gift shops are even-tempered.The researchers then culled 76,000 bank transactions of these participants for six months. They analysed how similar each participants' personality was to that of their shopping basket's character. The result: ""personality-matched consumption"" results in higher levels of happiness. In other words, extroverts are happier to receive a voucher for a bar, while introverts prefer a gift card for a bookshop.So the secret to happiness? Make sure that you spend money on others, prioritise experiences over things, use money to buy time - and spend it in a way that suits your personality and values.The ethical planner 'It's the carbon equivalent of giving up a car' DAVID MCDONALD, 54 From Hastings, East SussexAfter three decades of working as a financial planner, David McDonald experienced a feeling of unease and unhappiness. ""I couldn't quite put my finger on it,"" he says, ""but it was going on at a time when I was getting more concerned about environmental issue.""Planning to retire, he put his business up for sale. ""I thought, 'that's it, I'm done'. Maybe I'll just spend time walking the dog, and I can do my best for the environment by picking plastic bottles up off the beach.""Then, his son's suggestion to watch Cowspiracy, a documentary about the environmental impacts of animal agriculture, left a lasting impression. McDonald decided to set up The Path, a financial practice that focuses on investments combating the climate crisis.""People are doing micro activities [like avoiding plastic bags]. But moving £20,000 from traditional investing into impact investing is the carbon equivalent of taking one car off the road.""Now he is helping clients to align their savings with their environmental values, and he fundamentally changed his own spending and lifestyle: he changed his car, sold his hot tub and turned off his oil-fired Aga cooker.He altered his diet to ""mostly vegan and vegetarian days"". Next, he plans to install a ground-source heat pump.",Newspaper
42,Sometimes the smartest strategy is a matter of luck;MASTERCLASS Chengwei Liu,"March 2, 2020 Monday",International,"Financial Times (London, England)",853,853,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,,Sometimes the smartest strategy is a matter of luckMASTERCLASS Chengwei Liu,"An MBA can boost your salary, your connections and your career prospects - but what will you actually learn? In an occasional series, we showcase the work of teachers at top-ranked business schools.At one point in Moneyball, Michael Lewis' book on the improbable winning run of the Oakland A's in the early 2000s, Billy Beane, general manager of the underfunded baseball outfit, makes a surprising declaration. His statistical analysis doesn't work in the play-offs, he says - that's down to luck.He uses more colourful language, but the point is that Beane is aware that, for all his ingenuity in identifying undervalued players, luck or randomness is an inescapable factor in baseball, as it is in all walks of life.Yet luck played a part in the story in more ways than one. Moneyball is often portrayed as a triumph of data analysis, but that is not sufficient to explain the success of the A's, because data on players as well as the techniques for crunching it had been publicly available for decades. What helped swing things Beane's way was his rivals' tendency to reach too soon for luck as an explanation for performance.Over many years, scouts and team managers had built up stereotypes about what good players looked like. Competent but counter-stereotypical players such as the ""submarine pitcher"" Chad Bradford were underestimated because managers concluded that their successes had to be down to mere luck. Such biases - and the consequent misattribution of luck - protected these ""hidden gems"" from discovery until Beane's statistical approach cut through to the facts.The result was a team that could take on the giants of the sport and reach the play-offs four seasons running. Thanks to Lewis's book, Beane's strategy has become widespread across baseball and has filtered into other sports.This contrarian approach can be used in business as well, where strategy and behavioural science can be combined to exploit irrational biases. I call this ""analytical behavioural strategy"": it consists in drawing on behavioural science to search for contrarian opportunities, and then using data analysis to formulate an exploitation strategy.For instance, most people don't anticipate regression to the mean - that is, that the exceptional will probably be followed by the average. This, though, is the likeliest outcome whenever a business's performance - in terms of sales, say - is not entirely under the control of those in charge.A great performance may suggest that managers are doing a great job, but it's more likely to arise from fortunate timing - luck. By definition, luck is not going to persist: the business's future performance will regress downward to the mean. A good contrarian strategist looks for evidence that rivals are not mindful of this.Take ""top CEOs"", for example - specifically the annual top 30 list compiled by Barron's magazine. When I analysed the 2005-10 line-ups in terms of how the companies they led performed, a clear, inverted V-shape pattern emerged: the performance (as measured by factors such as sales growth, profitability and stock price) improved before the CEO made the list, but plummeted afterwards.The usual explanations for such decline include complacency or hubris on the part of the CEO. A simpler explanation, however, is that the CEOs were never that special in the first place. It was luck that enabled them to attract unwarranted attention after successes. And it was (bad) luck that made many of them attract unwarranted blame after failures.A contrarian strategist can profit from rivals' ""luck biases"" in at least two ways: short sell and buy low. A salient success is rarely sustainable but the market usually believes otherwise. Consider the 50 companies featured in three of the most popular business bestsellers of the past 40 years: In Search of Excellence, Good to Great and Built to Last. Of the 50, 16 failed within five years after the books in which they starred were published, and 23 became mediocre as they underperformed in the S&P 500 index.Next time you browse the business bestsellers section, pay attention to the companies featured. Instead of trying to emulate them, as your rivals may do, you should make these ""role models"" your target for short selling.On the other hand, opportunities also lurk in the ""regression upward"" that often follows a notable failure. A common reaction to failure is to find scapegoats and fire them - as many ex-CEOs and sports coaches can attest. Nevertheless, the more extreme the failure, the less we should attribute it to the person, and the more to the system. Otherwise we create an opportunity for the shrewd contrarian, who can step in and hire the scapegoat.Businesses that are aware of these biases are better placed than those that aren't. Fortune favours the strategist with a clear-eyed view of luck.Chengwei Liu is associate professor of strategy and behavioural science at Warwick Business School and ESMT Berlin and author of 'Luck, A Key Idea for Business and Society' (Routledge)A great performance may suggest that managers are doing a great job, but it's more likely to be luck",Newspaper
43,The EU should regulate Big Tech as 'attention utilities',"March 2, 2020 Monday",International,"Financial Times (London, England)",788,788,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,Tristan Harris,The EU should regulate Big Tech as 'attention utilities',"T he European Commission's new digital strategy missed a momentous opportunity to better shape our global future. While it may create marginal advantages for the bloc in the race to control data and artificial intelligence, it fails to address the way digital technology platforms are degrading democracies. That will undermine the EU's ability to accomplish its agenda.When I was working as a design ethicist at Google, I saw how the emergence of the ""attention extraction"" business model led to vast individual and societal harms. The social media platforms now intermediate the way we construct shared truths and social relationships.This business model sells advertisers and political actors highly sophisticated techniques to manipulate individuals and the public sphere. Children and teens are especially vulnerable.The commission has earned a reputation as the world's foremost online watchdog. Brussels' General Data Protection Regulation has become the gold standard for data protection - about 120 countries have adopted privacy laws - and its proposal to create a shared data pool has merit. But the new EU strategy, despite its attempts to lay down rules for artificial intelligence and data use, fails to grapple with the underlying crisis.Signs include rampant polarisation, extremism, fake news and toxic tribalism, which are amplified by today's major digital platforms. Tech companies are distracting, dividing and outraging citizens to the point where there is little basis for common ground. This is a direct threat to democracy For example, the EU wants a Green Deal - but how can it achieve that if a majority of YouTube climate change videos oppose the scientific consensus, as one 2019 study showed?How can the bloc promote unity and democracy if tech platforms amplify extremism and spread conspiracies that inspire mass shootings and divide society? While nations protect their physical borders, tech platforms leave digital borders wide open. In more than 70 countries, disinformation campaigns have been used to undermine elections, swing referendums and elect quasidictators. If Russia tried to fly a fighter jet into EU airspace, they would be met by Nato. But if Russia launches content intended to sow division and fracture the EU, Facebook and Google's powerful automated microtargeting algorithms are there to help. We must not ignore the lessons from the Cambridge Analytica scandal.This crisis gives the commission a chance to convert online lawlessness into humane and regenerative technology that will lead the world. Platforms such as Google, Facebook and YouTube are creating the public infrastructure of the digital age; we should treat it as we do telephones, trains or power grids.First, the EU should create a new corporate classification for large, dominant social platform businesses that have created vital public digital infrastructure. These ""attention utilities"" should be required to operate in the public interest, according to rules and licences that guide their business models.Traditional companies have been subject to licensing for many years. Attention utilities should be required to obey limits on data extraction and message amplification practices that drive polarisation, and should be required to protect children. We should ban or limit microtargeting of advertising, recommendations and other behavioural nudges.Second, instead of relying on revenue based on advertising, attention utilities should be required to convert to a monthly licence fee model a bit like the BBC or a subscription like Netflix. They must adhere to the terms of an operating licence framed by a duty of care.Margrethe Vestager, the EU antitrust commissioner, has suggested Facebook should use a subscription model.Third, attention utilities should be subject to a ""social impact assessment"", in which their new products are evaluated for their potential impact on mental health, social isolation, fake news, polarisation and democracy. This preclearance would be akin to an environmental impact assessment or safety protocols used for medical devices.Finally, the EU should create a new directorate to regulate and oversee an industry that is increasingly central to every aspect of our lives. It should identify key research needs, require platforms to be interoperable and help other EU agencies to apply existing law to online companies.The EU can lead the world toward more humane technology. But doing so requires thinking more broadly about reining in social media platforms to prevent them from degrading our democracies.The writer is president and co-founder of the Center for Humane TechnologyCommission has a chance to convert online lawlessness into humane, regenerative technology",Newspaper
44,Coronavirus in Scotland: Sturgeon says 'many more' may be infected as six cases confirmed,"March 4, 2020 Wednesday",International,thetimes.co.uk,793,793,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,"Katrine Bussey, Douglas Barrie",Coronavirus in Scotland: Sturgeon says 'many more' may be infected as six cases confirmed,"Nicola Sturgeon warned that ""many more"" people in Scotland will contract coronavirus after five new cases were confirmed, bringing the total north of the border to six.The latest cases - in the Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Forth Valley, Ayrshire and Grampian areas - were confirmed following the tracing of contacts of people known to be infected with the virus.Scotland's first patient, in Tayside, was said yesterday to work for Food Standards Scotland. The state-funded agency, based in Aberdeen, said: ""We respect every patient's right to confidentiality and would expect others to do the same.""Dr Catherine Calderwood, Scotland's chief medical officer, said: ""Scotland is well equipped to deal with this kind of infection and we are doing everything we can to contain the virus and minimise the risk to the public.""Clinicians are now conducting contact tracing - the process of gathering details of the places those who have tested positive visited and the people they have been in contact with. Close contact involves either face-to-face contact or spending more than 15 minutes within two metres of an infected person. The risk is very low in situations where someone may have passed a patient on the street or in a shop.""We can all play our part to limit the spread of the virus by washing our hands frequently for 20 seconds as well as always carrying tissues and using them to catch coughs and sneezes, then putting the tissue in a bin, and don't touch your face.""Thirty two new cases were confirmed in England yesterday, plus two in Northern Ireland, taking the UK total to 90. All six coronavirus patients in Scotland are said to be clinically well and receiving care in hospital.Professor Chris Whitty, the chief medical officer for England, said that the Westminster government was poised to accept that the virus could no longer be stamped out in Britain and that it would switch from aiming to contain the virus to delaying its spread. A ban on handshakes is being considered.In efforts to ensure that the public follow health advice, the Behavioural Insights Team, known as the ""nudge unit"", has been brought into the Downing Street ""war room"". It told ministers to suggest concrete steps that were achievable and give people a sense of control.On a visit to the NHS 24 Centre at the Golden Jubilee Hospital in Clydebank Ms Sturgeon said that the public should be assured ""that health protection teams working on this have all the information they need to make sure that patients are given the appropriate care they need but also that contact tracing is done quickly and robustly and those processes are already under way"".While the Scottish government has forecast that as many as 80 per cent of Scots could become ill with the virus, the first minister said that this was the very worst outcome.""People right now are hearing big numbers, that are scary numbers and it is important we continue to put these in context. These are worst-case scenarios,"" she said. ""Whatever the number of people who might end up getting coronavirus might be, the vast majority will have mild symptoms, it will be like a cold or a mild case of flu. It will be a smaller number who develop complications and need hospitalisation and that happens with seasonal flu every year.""NHS 24 has set up a phone line for people without symptoms of coronavirus to call to receive more information, with advice also available on the NHS Inform website. On Monday, the day after Scotland's first case was confirmed, the helpline received 538 calls, with a further 430 received on Tuesday. By the end of Tuesday there had been 264,118 visits to the coronavirus page on the NHS Inform website.Finance ministers from Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are to press the UK government on what extra health funding will be allocated to deal with the outbreak.Kate Forbes, the Scottish finance secretary, said that the issue was on the agenda for a meeting with Stephen Barclay, the chief secretary to the Treasury. ""I think it is really important that we are able to share information and have an ongoing dialogue in terms of funding,"" she said.Residents at a sheltered housing complex in Onthank, Kilmarnock, East Ayrshire, were advised to stay in their homes overnight on Tuesday as a tenant who had returned from southeast Asia was tested. They were told yesterday they could ""carry on as normal"".Scotland's chief medical officer said that there was ""no scientific reason"" to cancel the country's Six Nations game with France at Murrayfield on Sunday.Yesterday Professor Whitty told BBC Radio 4's                    Today                    programme: ""At this point we think it is likely, not definite, that we will move into onward transmission and an epidemic here in the UK.""",Newspaper; Web Publication

This will have an impact on productivity. But small businesses will get more time to pay tax, and people on zerohours contracts will get support with sick pay.SCHOOLS Class sizes will be allowed to exceed the current limit of 30 pupils. Pupils and teachers will also be permitted to go to different schools if their usual ones are closed or disrupted.HOSPITALS Patients who are not critically ill with coronavirus or other conditions will be discharged early to free up bed spaces for infected people. Retired doctors and nurses will be brought back to help deal with the extra demand, and NHS volunteers will help with tasks such as taking food to patients and carrying out porter duties.POLICE AND FIRE SERVICES If a significant number of police officers and firefighters are off sick with coronavirus, services will be reduced to ""critical functions"", including focusing on serious crime and maintaining public order.ARMY Soldiers could be deployed to critical sites such as nuclear facilities, government buildings and parliament to ""back-fill"" roles left vacant by sick police and security guards.SOCIALISING ""Social - or population - distancing"" will encourage people to avoid social contact outside essential work, and working from home. More people would be encouraged to work from home. Large-scale public gatherings could be banned. Officials did not rule out asking pubs not to show Euro 2020 football matches on TV in the summer. The VE Day 75th anniversary celebrations in May could be cancelled.CARE HOMES The most at-risk groups are the elderly and those with long-term conditions, so extra provisions will be made for care homes. This could include such facilities being quarantined to stop visitors transmitting the infection, and providing stockpiles of food and medicine to the elderly.MORTUARIES The plan does not specifically mention mortuaries but says ""there could well be an increase in deaths arising from the outbreak, particularly amongst vulnerable and elderly groups"". It adds: ""The UK Government and devolved administrations will provide advice for local authorities."" It says steps will be taken to ensure the ""dignity"" of those who lose their lives.BORDERS Border Force officers will be given powers to take temperatures and test people arriving in the UK. Public health officials are currently doing this at airports and ports, but legislation later this month will allow Border Force staff to insist people are swabbed - with authority to detain anyone who refuses.HOLIDAYS People should not cancel their holidays abroad yet unless they plan to travel to countries severely affected by coronavirus, in which case they should check the Foreign Office website for travel advice. However, anyone who is classified at risk should consider not travelling.PANIC BUYING The action plan does not mention panic buying, but there has been anecdotal evidence of people stocking up with essential items, hand sanitiser and other hygiene products.The Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies is using behavioural science to anticipate any panic buying.Officials said it was less likely that people would ""panic"" than ""do what was logical"" in stocking up, and that in a crisis people were more likely to be altruistic than selfish.Global cases latest Coronavirus has strengthened its grip around the globe, with confirmed cases reaching 92,817 by late last night.The number of recorded deaths from the Covid-19 outbreak was 3,159 while the number who have recovered stood at 48,201. Outside of China, South Korea, Italy and Iran remain the worst affected so far.South Korea has 5,186 cases and 28 deaths, Italy has 2,502 cases and 79 deaths and Iran has 2,336 cases and 77 deaths.Argentina became the latest country to confirm it had its first case last night.

46,CONTAI IN AND DELAY;MILLIONS COULD BE TOLD TO WORK FROM HOME UNDER STRATEGY TO STOP SPREAD,"March 4, 2020 Wednesday",International,Metro (UK),430,430,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,DOMINIC YEATMAN,CONTAI IN AND DELAYMILLIONS COULD BE TOLD TO WORK FROM HOME UNDER STRATEGY TO STOP SPREAD,"MILLIONS of employees could be sent to work from home to stall the coronavirus.The measure is part of the government's four-prong strategy to 'contain, delay, research and mitigate' Covid-19.In the containment stage that has already begun, the focus is on detecting new cases, isolating patients and tracing people they have had contact with.If the virus becomes established, the aim will be to delay its spread, 'pushing it away from' the winter flu season.At this stage, measures will be considered such as encouraging home working, closing schools and cutting down the number of large-scale gatherings.If the virus advances into the 'mitigate' stage, responses could include making room in hospitals by discharging patients early to be cared for at home. Retired doctors could be brought back to work and services such as the police may have to focus on only essential functions if staff sickness levels are high.The research 'phase' - work to find ways of stopping the virus - will last until the threat has been dealt with.Boris Johnson admitted yesterday it was too soon to say if everybody's life would be disrupted by the bug.But chief medical officer Prof Chris Whitty predicted: 'There will come a point where the amount of transmission is so great that the idea of just containing ceases to make sense. It's going to take two to three months to the peak, and two to three months after the peak to decline again.' The PM's chief scientific officer Sir Patrick Vallance stressed that the more drastic measures were not yet required. 'If you go too early you end up with a lot of disruption at a time you are not getting any benefit,' he added.On school closures, he said the benefits would be weighed against the disruption it would cause and it would be for the PM to sign off any large-scale shutdown.Health secretary Matt Hancock said sick leave rules may be changed so people in self-isolation can sign themselves off for 14 days without seeing a doctor to get a note.The TUC called for new laws to ensure millions of workers who don't qualify for statutory sick pay will not lose out.Sir Patrick admitted self-isolation risked leaving the elderly cut off, adding: 'You definitely don't want situations where people are afraid to come to their front doors.' Prof Whitty said advice was still being prepared for care homes.'The thing that is very clear from behavioural science is that the response of the British public to disasters and emergencies is extraordinary altruism,' he added.Adverts urging the public to frequently wash their hands will be rolled out today.",Newspaper

Retailers have also seen a rise of 10 per cent in sales of disinfectants and 7 per cent for liquid soap.Facebook and Twitter are littered with photographs of empty shelves and shoppers appear to have thrown empty boxes into the aisles.Shortages seem to have spread to cupboard items such as rice, pasta, couscous, Pot Noodles, bottled water, toilet roll and pet food.The rush to the shops and a surge in online grocery orders comes as concerned families fear they may have to put themselves into a form of home quarantine'. But the scramble, mirrored around the world, is at odds with the advice of the Government's Chief Scientific Adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance.Standing alongside Boris Johnson yesterday, he said: I think the advice is that there is absolutely no reason to be doing any panic buying of any sort or going out and keeping large supplies of things. Clearly there will need to be measures in cases of household quarantine for making sure food is in the right place at the right time.'The Chief Medical Officer for England, Professor Chris Whitty, went further, suggesting the sick could safely rely on the kindness of others to make sure they had everything they need.He said behavioural science evidence showed that the response of the British public to disasters and emergencies is extraordinary outbreaks of altruism'.In contrast, Tim Lang, professor of food policy at City University, London, and author of a book called Feeding Britain', said: Stockpiling is an understandable response after weeks of growing concern about coronavirus.What has perplexed me is that the Government has been so slow to learn how fragile UK food systems are. Stockpiling at home ought to be the last line of food defence not the only line.'Fraser McKevitt, head of retail and consumer insight at analysts Kantar, said shoppers are heeding the hygiene advice. He said: Given the media focus around the outbreak of COVID-19 in February, it's unsurprising to see shoppers prudently protecting themselves from illness.'Boots and some other stores are limiting customers to buying a maximum of two bottles of hand sanitisers each.Industry experts said UK supermarkets have contingency plans to ensure food remains on shelves.However, senior food industry analyst Bruno Monteyne, of stockbrokers Bernstein, who is a former Tesco executive, made the shocking claim earlier this week that any major outbreak will quickly lead to panic buying, empty shelves and food riots'.But he stressed: The industry has ready-made plans to deal with that: plans are surely being drawn up with suppliers to rationalise product ranges and transition to a feed the nation' status when necessary.'He added: The objective isn't to scaremonger. On the contrary: the industry has plans to deal with this.'Meanwhile the British Retail Consortium insists that there is no evidence' to justify claims of chaos and food riots. Its director of food and sustainability, Andrew Opie, said: Disruption to supply chains has been limited, and the availability of products remains good.'© Daily Mail",Papers

It would switch from aiming to contain it to delaying its spread.However, Edward Argar, the health minister, told ITV's                    Good Morning Britain                   : ""We are still very much in the containment stage. We are ready for the delay phase when it is necessary. Professor Whitty hasn't advised that we go for that yet. He will be considering a range of factors as to when he thinks is the right time to move from a containment phase to a delay phase. We stand ready as and when and, if he does, to what is necessary.""Mr Argar added that the ""overwhelming majority"" of cases in the UK could be traced to foreign travel and that as yet there was ""no evidence of community transmission of this disease"".In efforts to ensure that the public follow health advice, the Behavioural Insights Team, or ""nudge unit"", has been brought into the Downing Street ""war room"". It told ministers to suggest concrete steps that were achievable and gave people a sense of control, which led to advice that people should wash their hands while singing                    Happy Birthday                    twice when they get home or go to work.A public health information campaign featuring a dirty door handle was chosen after tests showed that disgust was the most arresting emotion. Some 96 per cent of people remembered the poster, compared with 85 per cent recalling one that simply told people to wash their hands. ""Just information works on a cognitive level. But disgust works on an emotional level,"" a source said.Behavioural scientists have also been drafted on to the government's scientific advisory group for emergencies and have contributed to the decision not to cancel large gatherings yet. They told officials that closing schools and playing football matches behind closed doors could lead to children and fans gathering in other ways that were more likely to spread the virus. They also advised that taking such measures now risked seeing people lose patience with them by the time they would make a bigger difference.Most of the new cases were linked to travel to Italy but there is concern about three cases detected in intensive care units in people with no recent travel. With no obvious source for infection, health chiefs were scrambling to find out how widely the disease is being passed on.Professor Whitty said: ""It is not yet clear whether they contracted it directly or indirectly from an individual who had recently returned from abroad. This is being investigated.""Andrew Freedman of Cardiff University said the discovery ""suggests that there are likely to be other undiagnosed cases that may lead to further spread"".After the prime minister insisted that he was continuing to shake hands, Paul Cosford of Public Health England said this might have to change. ""We may get to a point where if we see more widespread infection we ask people to limit the social contact they have with each other,"" he said. ""What's most important at the moment is that people practise good hand and respiratory hygiene.""Discussions are under way about declaring an emergency under section 18A of the Medical Act 1983, which would allow the General Medical Council to restore licences to practise as doctors to recently retired staff. It is understood that the focus is on those who left practice in the past two or three years, opening up a potential pool of 15,500 staff to help the NHS to cope.Helena McKeown, of the British Medical Association, said that some would be ""able and willing"" to help but warned: ""Bearing in mind many retired doctors' ages, we must consider their wellbeing and whether they would be putting themselves at risk.""Professor Whitty said coronavirus was probably spreading freely in the UK already and an epidemic was likely.""It's when it's going from person to person to person and then we pick it up - that's what we mean by community transmission,"" he told                    Today                    on BBC Radio 4.

Q&A                   : Should I get tested                   Tests for coronavirus are only done when there is a high chance of someone having the illness. This may be because you have been in close contact in the past 14 days with someone who tested positive or have travelled to a country or area with a high coronavirus risk.                   How do you get tested on the NHS?                   Call NHS 111 where you will be assessed by a health professional. If your case is considered risky they will notify a local health team and direct you to a testing location.                   What is the test?                   Nurses will carry out a swab of the nose and the mouth. They may also take blood and faeces samples. These are taken to one of 12 testing labs in the UK. Results are normally back within 12-72 hours and you may be asked to self-isolate.                   What if I test positive for the virus?                   You will be contacted by your local healthcare provider. You may receive treatment to relieve the symptoms while your body fights the illness. Antibiotics do not work against coronavirus. You will be instructed to remain in strict isolation until further tests show the virus is no longer in your system.                   Can I get tested privately?

Scotland is well equipped to deal with this kind of infection and we are doing everything we can to contain the virus at this stage and minimise the risk to the public,"" she said.""Clinicians are now conducting contact tracing, the process of gathering details of the places those who have tested positive visited and the people they have been in contact with.""Calderwood has echoed warnings from elsewhere in the UK that there is likely to be a significant surge in coronavirus cases, peaking in two to three months time. Following Scotland's first case at the weekend, two further cases were announced yesterday, after more than 850 negative tests for the virus.She said earlier this week that in a worst-case scenario between 50% and 80% of the population could be infected during the course of the epidemic, with 4% of those needing hospitalisation.block-time updated-timeUpdated at 9.34am GMTblock-time published-time 9.10am GMT  'Highly likely' community transmission ongoing in UK  There are now several cases in the UK where healthcare officials cannot see where coronavirus infection has come from clearly, whether it is from having been abroad or having been in contact with someone who has, Whitty adds.""That makes it highly likely that there is some level of community transmission in the UK,"" he says.""I think we should work on the assumption that it is here at very low levels and we should work on that assumption going forward.""block-time updated-timeUpdated at 9.35am GMTblock-time published-time 9.07am GMT Although the total number of coronavirus cases in the world are still dominated by China, its numbers are coming down quickly, British MPs have been told by Professor Chris Whitty, the UK's chief medical adviser.He adds, however, that it won't be known if there will be a rebound until restrictions are lifted.Whitty is appearing along with Jenny Harries, deputy chief medical officer for England, in front of parliament's health committee. Chances of containing the outbreak globally are ""slim to zero"", he said.block-time updated-timeUpdated at 9.16am GMTblock-time published-time 9.00am GMT British hospitals may currently not have enough respiratory resources to deal with absolutely everyone who would need to be treated in hospital, according to a senior executive.The health service was coping well at the moment, said Neil Dixon, chief executive of the NHS Confederation, whose members provide services to the National Health Service.""Of course there may come a point where the level of infection becomes so great that the NHS and doctors and so on will have to make quite difficult choices about who to treat and when to treat them.""If you take something like intensive care, people make those choices at the moment. The answer is that there will be more of those kinds of choices going forward. Things like intensive care, we have got 4,000 beds, but we will be able to flex that, there will be more, and it's mostly about giving respiratory support to people.""We can put in many more beds like that, which are sort of intensive care beds, to treat larger and larger numbers of people, but there may come a point where you say: 'well I am not going to move somebody because, a, the movement itself might be more difficult, we may not have enough respiratory stuff to deal with absolutely everybody, but none of us know.""It was, Dixon added, about getting a balance right in terms of reassuring people, and Britain ""probably"" had one of the best health systems in the world.block-time updated-timeUpdated at 9.23am GMTblock-time published-time 8.38am GMT The British government has hinted it may reverse a controversial decision to withhold information about the geographical spread of the coronavirus. Heath minister Edward Argar acknowledged public concerns about the news that the government would not be releasing information about the location of new cases until a weekly round-up each Friday.Speaking to BBC Breakfast he admitted the government was ""learning every day"" and was looking at a ""tech solution"" to allow it to keep the public informed about the spread of disease.On Wednesday, Chris Whitty, the chief medical officer said the government would stop providing daily updates on the location of patients who had tested positive ""due to the number cases"".The decision prompted accusations of secrecy and concerns that it would led to the spread of fake news.Argar said: ""It's absolutely right, that we give out as much information as we can.""He added: ""What we're looking at is whether we can find a tech solution that will enable us to do that to keep people informed [which] is hugely important. But to do it in an efficient way that it's easy to administer and easy to get the information out.""His remarks suggest the government is considering the example of South Korea where phone alerts are available to signify when users come within 100 metres of a confirmed case, based on government data.Argar said: ""My boss, the health secretary, is clear that we will report on geographical spread and geographical locations, but there's a little bit of a lag time because of that big increase.""He added: ""We're going to continue with that geographical information because I think in anything of this sort, and it's a new disease, we're learning every day, how it works. Understandably, people will have concerns and questions. It's important that we share as much information as we can with the public to reassure and to keep people informed.

That person had recently returned from a religious pilgrimage to Israel and Egypt. The ban was in effect for 48 hours and subject to review, authorities said. The cases come as Greek authorities react to a developing crisis as thousands of people arrive at the country's border with Turkey.About 12,500 people are estimated to be waiting on the Turkish side of the Greek border after the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, said on Saturday he would            open his country's borders for refugees fleeing the nine-year war in Syria to cross into Europe.

56,Johnson prepares economic response strategy;Epidemic threat. Disruption prospects ; Carney and Sunak summoned for private talks on ways to ease concerns about outbreak,"March 6, 2020 Friday",International,"Financial Times (London, England)",845,845,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,GEORGE PARKER;LAURA HUGHES ;CHRIS GILES,Johnson prepares economic response strategyEpidemic threat. Disruption prospects ; Carney and Sunak summoned for private talks on ways to ease concerns about outbreak,"Boris Johnson called the Bank of England governor and chancellor to Downing Street yesterday to plan an economic response to the coronavirus outbreak and prepare for a likely epidemic without sparking public panic.The prime minister discussed with Mark Carney and Rishi Sunak measures that could include easing monetary policy and providing business support measures in next week's Budget.Downing Street declined to comment on the private talks, part of a wider strategy of making preparations discreetly for the possibility the virus will cause economic and social disruption.Supermarket shelves stripped of dried pasta and other food testify to a febrile public mood, and behavioural scientists - so-called nudge experts - have been brought in to advise ministers on the dynamics of panic.The likelihood of coronavirus breaking out into wider society now dominates government thinking on issues such as the impact on the economy, whether parliament will have to be shut or the prospect of disruption to the Brexit timetable.Mr Johnson told ITV's This Morning programme the country was ""still at the stage where the single best thing we can do ... is just wash our hands"". But measures now on the table go well beyond advice on personal hygiene.Mr Carney said this week he wanted action taken to help households and companies ""manage through an economic shock that could prove large but will ultimately be temporary"".The BoE welcomed an announcement from UK Finance, which represents the financial services sector, that its members would offer support to customers losing money as a result of coronavirus, including increasing overdrafts or offering repayment relief on loans. The central bank is also working on a plan to provide lenders with incentives to offer small companies help in dealing with supply chain disruption and it hopes to roll this out quickly.Mr Carney and Andrew Bailey, his successor, have said the BoE's monetary policy committee could, if needed, cut interest rates from 0.75 per cent before its meeting scheduled for March 26.Mr Sunak's Budget next week is being written on a theme of ""security"" and will include measures to help companies facing cash flow problems because of the virus, including more time to pay tax bills.The chancellor might also use the outbreak as justification to suspend the fiscal rules set out in the 2019 Conservative manifesto, something that Mr Johnson wanted to do in any case.The rules require a balanced current budget - day-to-day spending - by 2023, but any extra spending or fall in tax receipts linked to the virus would endanger that target.Mr Sunak has pledged to do whatever is necessary to protect the economy, but his allies have so far suggested the Budget will prescribe targeted interventions rather than a big fiscal stimulus.Among those attending yesterday's meeting of the government's Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies were behavioural experts called upon to advise ministers on the likely effect of policy decisions and whether they could exacerbate the mood of public anxiety.Downing Street was quick to dispel suggestions that parliament could be closed from March 31 until September because of the virus, a move that Mr Johnson's allies said would send the wrong ""signal"" to the people.Jacob Rees-Mogg, leader of the Commons, told MPs: ""There are no plans to close the House down. The public will expect parliament to sit and get on with its job.""Mr Johnson's allies said he faced a difficult choice between taking measures to delay the spread of the virus so it peaked in the spring when the National Health Service was under less pressure, and acting too quickly and causing unnecessary disruption.Chris Whitty, chief medical officer, said this week that actions such as reducing mass gatherings and closing schools might be good for the NHS but ""some of the things we would have to do would come at a social cost"".Mr Johnson said he was being told for now not to overreact: ""At the moment what they are telling me is, actually, slightly counter-intuitively, things like closing schools and stopping big gatherings don't work as well perhaps as people think in stopping the spread."" An epidemic would put extreme strain on the government as it struggles to negotiate a post-Brexit trade deal and prepare complex new border and immigration arrangements before Mr Johnson's December 31 deadline.Downing Street said Mr Johnson would not seek to extend the transition period beyond 2020. Michel Barnier, EU chief negotiator, said: ""For the moment, circulation between two countries is open ... meetings are not forbidden.""Asked if the virus could cause the cancellation of trade talks in coming weeks, Mr Barnier said: ""We are up to 200 people in the same room. We will take precautions, I promise.""Additional reporting by Jim Brunsden in Brussels More reports page 4 FT Big Read page 11; Opinion page 13 Lex page 14; Threat to airlines page 15 Markets pages 25-26'There are no plans to close the House.

Delaying the virus may not mean any fewer people get it, but spreading them over a longer period would make it easier to manage.The results of this modelling give the government a ""menu of options"" that functions more like a ladder. At the bottom are measures that are not too onerous, but could make a significant difference: advising people to work from home, suggesting the frail elderly avoid crowds and proposing self-isolation for flu-like symptoms even if you have not travelled.These are likely be the first measures announced by the government when it formally announces Britain is switching from the ""contain"" to the ""delay"" phase of the outbreak.As Professor Chris Whitty, the chief medical officer, said last week, this is not a hard line and delaying measures have already began. But a formal announcement will help to emphasise that ministers are now advising steps beyond hand-washing.Although Boris Johnson has said that he continues to shake hands, a warning against close physical contact unless necessary is also a possibility after France put a stop to ""la bise"", the traditional cheek kiss.Farther up the ladder are other social distancing measures, such as advising people to avoid pubs, restaurants and other gatherings. This would slow the progress of the virus, but be a nightmare for the hospitality industry, which is why it is not expected to come until things worsen.Oliver Dowden, the culture secretary, said this morning that shutting museums and galleries was ""premature, we are not anywhere near that sort of stage"".Similarly mass gatherings of other kinds will continue for now. Nor is Britain about to follow Italy in playing sports games behind closed doors, a decision based on behavioural science modelling suggesting that people will just watch games in pubs instead, increasing the risk of infection in confined spaces.Mr Dowden told the BBC: ""We shouldn't be cancelling events at this stage, but I just say as a caution that we do keep these things under review and that may change in the future.""At the top of the ladder are school closures. Professor Whitty believes this is likely to have only a ""marginal effect"" because children are not badly affected and are likely to find ways of congregating anyway if freed from classes for weeks. Given the childcare headache this would pose for millions of workers - not least in the NHS - shutting schools ""does not look a terribly attractive option"", he told MPs.However, it has not been ruled out entirely: in the worst-case scenario, even a marginal effect could mean the difference between life and death for large numbers of people.At the moment, we do not yet know how bad things will get, and so which options ministers will have to choose. This will become clearer over the coming weeks, but given the huge uncertainties over the epidemiology of the virus, may never be cut and dried.So far, ministers have been able to simply follow scientific advice, but harder judgment calls lie ahead.",Newspaper; Web Publication
58,Price controls on hand gel and face masks will make shortages worse,"March 6, 2020 Friday",International,The Daily Telegraph (London),1027,1027,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,RYAN BOURNE,Price controls on hand gel and face masks will make shortages worse,"Have you tried buying hand sanitiser this week? By all accounts, store shelves have been emptied of the stuff, in the wake of public health warnings about the coronavirus. Social media is full of images of unfilled racks at supermarkets or chemists, with laments about how panic buyers are hoarding products away from those with compromised immune systems ""who really need it"". As a result of the backlash, Boots is now even rationing purchases to two per customer.At the same time, members of the public have been attacking third-party sellers for huge price rises for the same products on the Amazon marketplace. Face mask prices have jumped 2,000pc as the panic has taken hold, while a pack of 24 2oz bottles of Purell hand sanitiser, usually around £8 to £10 per box, have been going for over £300. Amazon has assured users that it is doing whatever it can to eliminate such profiteering. The Competition and Markets Authority has even issued a warning, with chairman Andrew Tyrie pledging to do whatever it can to ""act against rip-offs and misleading claims"".These phenomena are, of course, really two sides of the same coin. A surge in demand for face masks and sanitiser explains both the current observed shortages and some sellers hugely inflating prices. In the near-term, supply of both goods is constrained. As demand has spiked, the price the market can bear has risen dramatically. It's the inverse of prices of flights and hotels in Italy, Tenerife and Asia falling as demand for holidays has collapsed in areas of high virus prevalence.Whereas the public has no apparent problem with firms dropping prices though, sellers raising them during a global health crisis feel the heat. The price spike in face masks has even been denounced by Amazon as ""price gouging""- a term usually reserved for ""greedy profiteering"" on water and petrol following natural disasters. The government in France is threatening price regulation to stamp out such spikes. Other governments will be under public pressure to follow suit.Yet anti-price gouging laws, or even firms constraining prices now in the face of shortages, brings significant costs. Fixing prices below market rates dampens the message that price signals are telling us about relative scarcity and people's willingness to pay.That's worrying, because price rises help people become more careful about overuse or hoarding when products are scarce. And, in the longer term - which, right now, is especially important - higher prices create powerful profit incentives for new producers or merchants to make highly demanded supplies more widely available.In fact, anti-price gouging laws actively exacerbate the existing shortage problem, which is why economists overwhelming oppose them. Fixing prices below what customers are willing to pay encourages people to load up on the products when they are available. Restrictions such as ""two per customer"" rules can easily be circumvented by, say, getting every family member to buy separately. And such restrictions favour those who can check in on in-store availability regularly over those who value the product most.But the more important consequence is the discouragement of new producers or even small hoarders from bringing their supply to market. Given there's a chance that we could be in for a protracted global pandemic with restrictions on travel and transportation, or workers being sick and unavailable to produce or ship new products, imposing price controls could be extremely short-sighted.That's because the introduction of price gouging laws even after this shortage passes could dampen supplier plans for what the economist Tyler Cowen has called ""option ready supply"" for when there are future demand surges.Consider Uber surge pricing. When it starts raining, Uber prices spike as demand rises sharply. In the near term, this acts as a rationing device such that people who really value hailing a ride can do so. But it also encourages some additional drivers on to the road. Preventing this dynamic price adjustment has damaging consequences. Just after new year in 2015, an experiment occurred in New York when Uber's surge-pricing algorithm suddenly stopped working. As ride demand spiked, prices stayed flat. As a result, wait times doubled and the number of completed trips fell 80pc, since drivers had no increased incentive to go out and meet the new demand.Upwardly flexible prices do not just help supply adjust to constantly changing demand, however. They also encourage drivers to consider being more likely to go out in future when they foresee potential surges, such as if there's rain expected or a big public event. In the same way, allowing hand sanitiser and face mask price signals to operate now will make leading firms and merchants, who have big reputational concerns, more likely to develop robust supply chains to avoid future shortages. This is a point made by Nobel Prize-winning economist Richard Thaler.The behaviour of companies such as Amazon and others in, effectively, restraining third-party prices today may help them protect their customer-friendly reputation in the wake of a public health crisis. But by keeping prices low or, in the case of some American retailers, actively discounting them, they are making the products harder for new customers to obtain by encouraging the very hoarding that is infuriating the public.Price increases encourage us to find frugal ways to adapt and cope to undesirable shortages. Yes, ideally, everyone who needs the products would get exactly what they required to use in stopping the spread of this virus at reasonable prices. But in the absence of that perfect world, fixing prices artificially low can lead to big problems. We can see this with barren shelves and complaints. Governments would exacerbate the problem with populist ""price gouging"" laws.Ryan Bourne holds the R Evan Scharf chair for the public understanding of economics at the Cato Institute Economic Intelligence For unique insight into the world's economic issues, sign up to our Economic Intelligence newsletter, by Ambrose Evans-Pritchard and Jeremy Warner www.telegraph.co.uk/ ei-newsletter",Newspaper

It's like they're looking for the Prince Charming happy-ever-after ending and think it will make them feel better.Happiness is fleeting, we can't always be in a permanent haze of euphoria yet the whole build-up and execution of a wedding is building a narrative that makes you feel like marriage is heaven.If it doesn't feel like domestic bliss when you're in it, you feel like you've failed.I've one failed marriage behind me so I know what it feels like.Preparing to get married is the exciting bit but marriage itself requires hard graft and anything that feels like an uphill battle is generally not a good thing.The average cost of a wedding in Ireland in 2020 is (EURO)21,000 and that's on the smaller scale.The panic approach to the big day, the fighting over the guest list, the dieting to get the dream bod, it's all for utter show and has nothing to do with true love.It's all about the showmance and once you get hitched and the honeymoon is over, unless you are truly deeply in love with your husband, the anticlimax is the beginning of the end.In an era where female empowerment is held in high esteem, it's mad women are still obsessed with finding The One and settling down with a ring proving your eternal commitment and a piece of overrated paper sealing your longevity. It's so easy to get married but the paperwork involved in getting divorced and the financial heartache is painful.I've sat at many a ladies' lunch concealing my boredom as my friends compare diamond rings. We are talking grown women with fabulous careers who are still obsessed with showing off their rock.I'm in a seriously happy relationship right now and although we have two amazing kids together the rush is not on to get married.Oprah Winfrey met Stedman Graham in 1986 at a charity event and the pair have been together ever since.Though the two announced their engagement in 1992, wedding bells never followed and Oprah felt it was a good thing. She told Vogue: ""We would not have stayed together because marriage requires a different way of being in this world.""His interpretation of what it means to be a husband and what it would mean for me to be a wife would have been pretty traditional, and I would not have been able to fit into that.""The behavioural scientist Paul Dolan said: ""If you're a man, you should probably get married. If you're a woman, don't bother.""In his book Happy Ever After: Escaping The Myth Of The Perfect Life, Dolan delves into the myth that marital bliss exists.His book reignites an important debate: Is it bad for women to be married? We're supposed to learn on the job, but once we get hitched we sort of relax.We don't try as hard anymore or work on our relationship and we get stale.Everything in life that's worth it requires constant communication and attention. If you're not willing to work on your marriage trust me you shouldn't be in it.I've sat at many a ladies lunch concealing my boredom as grown women compare rings",Newspaper
62,"Playing down coronavirus is foolish. With big risks it's extremes, not averages, that matter","March 8, 2020 Sunday",International,thetimes.co.uk,1130,1130,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,Matthew Syed,"Playing down coronavirus is foolish. With big risks it's extremes, not averages, that matter","Last month I took the Tube to Vauxhall, south London, walked across a large roundabout and went through the side entrance of a green glass building on the South Bank. I left my phone in a mesh box at reception and was escorted to the sixth floor. There, in the heart of MI6's headquarters, I found myself surrounded by people - heroes, many of them - who help to keep us safe.I had been invited to take part in a discussion on risk and, as I listened to the operatives, found myself reflecting on the asymmetry under which they work. Their operations become noticed only when they fail - when a terrorist plot gets through the net, a stabbing, perhaps, or an explosion. At this point, questions are raised: why did they miss obvious warning signs (obvious after the event)? Why were they so slow on the uptake?When these operatives perform well, on the other hand, they are invisible. They can't publicise their actions for fear of alerting terrorists to their methods of infiltration, so you never hear about them. In much the same way that you will never read the deliberate spelling mistake in this sentence because of the diligence of a (brilliant) sub-editor, you will never know about the MI6 operative in Kabul who maybe saved your life.Another asymmetry struck me, too, one with implications for the way we think about the coronavirus. I have lost count of the number of times I hear pundits playing down the threat of terrorism. Don't you realise that more people die in car crashes (1,870 last year) than in terror incidents (53 in the past five years), they say? Doesn't the media understand that wall-to-wall coverage is inciting unnecessary fear?Notwithstanding the slight to those at MI6 and beyond who work hard to keep these numbers low, isn't the comparison flawed at a deeper level? After all, if I get killed in a car crash today, it doesn't increase the risk of you getting killed in a car crash tomorrow. These events are statistically independent. This is why the probability of 10,000 people dying in car crashes next year is, practically, zero. It wouldn't happen in a thousand lifetimes.Terrorism (of the apocalyptic kind) belongs to a different class of risk. If these psychopaths had the opportunity to kill 10,000 or, indeed, 10 million, they would jump at the chance, whether by poisoning the water supply, making a dirty bomb, or whatever. The risk of 10,000 people dying because of a terrorist atrocity next year is vastly higher than the same number dying from car crashes - and without the intelligence services, it would have happened already.These thoughts have kept coming back to me over the past day or two. For isn't it fair to say that pandemics are characterised by a similar asymmetry? Pathogens create risks comparable to terrorism, while the virus-hunters, epidemiologists and frontline alarm-sounders are not dissimilar to the security services. They keep us safe, often under the radar of public awareness.To be frank, I was initially torn by this outbreak, fluctuating between the feeling that we are going OTT and the equally urgent feeling that I should stock up on long-life food. On Wednesday I asked Teddy, my six-year-old, if he preferred tinned tuna to those ghastly packaged noodles, while reassuring him that Covid-19, which he had learnt about in school and was certain had come from fleas, is nothing to worry about. ""But what about Grandad?"" he asked, wide-eyed.Experts have seemed unsure, too. In the early stages, many warned that we were worrying too much, that fear itself was the danger. Cass Sunstein, a former adviser to Barack Obama, wrote: ""A lot of people are more scared than they have any reason to be."" Others have offered the classic comparison stats that we see in relation to terrorism.Peter Diamandis, a bestselling author, told us that deaths from Covid-19 on February 20 were only a fraction of the deaths on the same day from cancer, heart disease and, for that matter, suicide.But have you noticed how such comparisons have become less frequent (a kind of reverse contagion) as the statistical dependence between Covid-19 deaths has become apparent? How they have faded in proportion to the outbreaks in South Korea, Italy and Iran, with community transmission emerging elsewhere? Instead of ""Why are we panicking?"", people started asking, ""Why didn't China act sooner?""The true danger, to my mind, isn't the coronavirus per se, but our serial exposure to the pandemics coming down the tracks. As we encroach upon new habitats (via logging, road-building and those grisly wet markets), we are coming into contact with millions of bacteria, fungi and protists within the animals that live there. Outbreaks are set to strike with increasing frequency. The virosphere is vast and complex, as David Quammen shows in his gripping book Spillover.The financial system has adopted ""circuit-breakers"" to prevent contagion in our intricately connected, increasingly fragile world. In a wise article yesterday, Kemal Dervis and Sebastian Strauss of the Brookings Institute called for a similar approach to virus threat, not least ""common protocols for temporary travel and trade restrictions in the event of a potential pandemic, supported by globally agreed early warning systems and thresholds for action"".I like this approach - which should include global regulations on food management and a broader reimagining of how we work, travel and interact. It is balanced, takes into account the exponentiality of contagion, and would help to pre-empt panic, rather than scrambling to catch up after it takes hold. It also reminds us of the importance of multilateral action, a skill we would be crazy to lose. Systemic risks tend not to respect national borders, a point we are learning with climate change, too.Of course, many would resist such an approach. They would tell us it is costly. That it will shave a fraction off global GDP. That if you look at the average number of deaths in recent pandemics, it is disproportionate. Indeed, as the months and years pass, and Covid-19 becomes a dim memory, they might wish to shut it down altogether, just as it is easy to become complacent about terrorism in the absence of a serious incident.But this is the insight that my time at MI6 planted deep in my mind. Just as terrorists wish to kill on a mass scale - and would do so without our constant vigilance - so nature will, perhaps quite soon, release a mutation with a deadly combination of high reproduction and death rates together with mild early symptoms. My sense is that, on balance, we should prepare for this now. For when it comes to big risks, it is not averages that matter; it is extremes.As the great Nassim Nicholas Taleb put it: ""Never cross a river that is on average four feet deep.""@MatthewSyed",Web Publication
63,PM: drastic action on coronavirus will be taken at right time,"March 9, 2020 Monday",International,thetimes.co.uk,1380,1380,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,"Chris Smyth, Whitehall Editor",PM: drastic action on coronavirus will be taken at right time,"Everyone with minor coughs and colds will soon be told to stay at home for a week when the government steps up the fight against coronavirus.The elderly will also be advised to avoid public gatherings, Boris Johnson suggested as he urged Britain to ""pull together in a united and national effort"" to defeat the outbreak.The prime minister insisted that drastic measures had to be imposed ""at the right time"" as he resisted pressure to follow other countries in cancelling mass events and shutting schools, saying this could be counterproductive.Two more patients were confirmed to have died of the virus in Britain yesterday, as 46 new cases took the total to 319. Both were understood to be in their 70s with underlying health problems, with one woman dying at New Cross hospital in Wolverhampton and another patient at the Epsom and St Helier NHS Trust in Surrey.Most of the five people who have died so far in Britain contracted the virus in this country, and officials are increasingly concerned at the number of cases with no link to overseas travel, suggesting that Covid-19 is circulating extensively in parts of the UK.The World Health Organisation (WHO) warned: ""Now that the virus has a foothold in so many countries, the threat of a pandemic has become very real."" The developments came as: Two more people died of coronavirus in Britain yesterday, taking the death toll here to five. A total of 46 more confirmed cases were announced, bringing the overall figure to 319. Globally there have been 4,009 deaths. All patients in NHS hospitals with respiratory problems were to be checked for coronavirus amid concern that the virus was spreading more widely. The whole of Italy was put into lockdown, with Giuseppe Conte, the prime minister, saying people should not travel except for work and emergencies. All public gatherings have been banned. Scientists said that Italy should be a warning to Britain of how rapidly the outbreak could get out of control. Germany reported its first deaths from the virus and urged people to work from home. France banned all gatherings of more than 1,000 people unless they were considered ""useful to the life of the nation"". A rescue flight was expected to bring 142 Britons back from a coronavirus-hit cruise ship in California.Last night the Foreign Office advised Britons against travelling to Italy and told those who return from the country to isolate themselves. It said: ""We have amended our travel advice to recommend against all but essential travel to Italy. The safety of British nationals is always our number one priority.""The advice is that anyone who arrives from Italy should now self- isolate for 14 days.""Professor Chris Whitty, the chief medical officer for England, said that everyone who is in hospital with pneumonia or other respiratory tract infections would now be tested for coronavirus after dozens of cases were picked up by routine testing in intensive care.Although regular handwashing is the only general advice, Professor Whitty said: ""What we are moving now to is a phase when we will be having to ask members of the general public to do different things than they would normally do.""He added: ""We are now very close to the time, probably within the next ten to 14 days, when the modelling would imply we should move to a situation where we say everybody who has even minor respiratory tract infections or a fever should be self-isolating for seven days afterwards.""We are expecting the numbers to increase initially quite slowly but really quite fast after a while and we have to catch it before the upswing begins.""Such a move would be designed to contain potential cases, as the end of the winter flu seasons makes coughs and colds more likely to be coronavirus.Mr Johnson said that the next stage would include advice to the elderly, saying ""we will set out further steps in the days and weeks ahead to help people protect themselves, their family and in particularly the elderly and vulnerable"".He added that there was ""no hiding from the fact that the coronavirus outbreak will present significant challenges for the UK just as it does in other countries"".Officials hope they can halve infections and reduce deaths by a third and plans are based on scientific modelling predicting how potential measures could reduce infections and deaths, set against the social disruption they would cause.""No single intervention is enough on its own to make the difference. We have to do things in combination and we have to do them at the right time,"" Mr Johnson said.Last week he said he was continuing to shake hands but after he was requested not to do so at a Commonwealth Day service yesterday, Mr Johnson said: ""There's a good reason for not shaking hands, which is that the behavioural psychologists say that if you don't shake somebody's hand then that sends an important message to them about the importance of washing your hands. So there's a subliminal cue there to everybody to wash your hands.""Rory Stewart, the former cabinet minister and London mayoral candidate, broke away from the broad political consensus behind the chief medical officer's advice and called on the government to start escalating its response by banning public gatherings.His call was dismissed by Dr Jenny Harries, the deputy chief medical officer, who told                    BBC Breakfast                   : ""Our advice is founded entirely on scientific evidence. Modellers are working hourly on cases as they arise to analyse the effects of different interventions, because we need a balanced response which maximises public safety and maximises effectiveness of the health service while minimising disruption to people's lives.""She stressed that timing of different phases of containment was essential, as activating the next step too soon could lead to people becoming less likely to follow it. Speaking to Sky's Kay Burley this morning, Dr Harries added that many thousands of people would become infected in Britain.""We will have significant numbers in a way which I think the country is not used to . . . so large numbers of the population will become infected [with coronavirus] but because it's a naive population, nobody has got antibodies to this virus currently.""Having said that, 99 per cent of those will almost certainly get better and most people will have a really quite mild disease and will not need to be in hospital and can be managed very safely and appropriately at home.""The prime minister defended his approach.""There's no question that this is going to become a significant, a much more significant outbreak than it currently is - that's obvious to everyone - but it is vital that we take the steps that we think are necessary at the right time and we follow the science,"" he said.""We mustn't do things which have no or limited medical benefit, nor things which could turn out actually to be counterproductive.""Cancelling sporting events and closing schools are not currently planned and Professor Whitty said: ""Anything we do, we have got to be able to sustain . . . There is a risk if we go too early people will understandably get fatigued and it will be difficult to sustain this over time.""                   Analysis                   The state's response to coronavirus is being driven by scientific modelling of each possible restriction - from banning hand-shaking to school closures - weighing up the potential benefit to health against its social cost.The results give the government a ""menu of options"" that functions more like a ladder. At the bottom are measures that are not too onerous, but could make a big difference, which is why advice to isolate yourself if you are ill will be the first step.The next stage is likely to focus on the elderly and other vulnerable groups, who could be advised to stay at home more.The model is informed by behavioural scientists, who fear that people would rebel against long-term draconian restrictions. This is why officials have not followed Italy in holding football matches behind closed doors. The model suggests people will watch in pubs instead, with a high risk of infection in confined spaces.At the top of the ladder are school closures. These are thought likely to have little effect because children will find ways of congregating.",Newspaper; Web Publication

Strategy PM argues more draconian action is at best ineffective, at worst counter-productive","Boris Johnson faced the country yesterday at a moment of high national danger in the coronavirus outbreak, but also knowing that he is approaching a phase of acute political peril too.The prime minister's mantra of doing ""the right thing at the right time"" to contain the virus - adopting a graded response and holding back from draconian measures for now - leaves him open to accusations he is failing to get ahead of the situation.Mr Johnson is facing awkward questions about why he has become something of an outlier in Europe, refraining from the travel restrictions and bans on large public gatherings seen in some neighbouring countries.""The government has made a serious mistake today,"" said Rory Stewart, the former Tory cabinet minister standing as an independent in the London mayoral contest. ""They should be acting much more aggressively to contain coronavirus. Schools should be shut now. All medium and large gatherings should be cancelled. All passengers coming from hotspots should be tested and quarantined.""As the National Health Service announced the death of the fifth Briton with coronavirus, health secretary Matt Hancock (pictured) encountered his toughest questioning yet from MPs, who are increasingly anxious the government's ""wash your hands"" message will no longer suffice.So when the prime minister convened a press conference on coronavirus, it was primarily intended to reassure the public but also designed to head off the highly damaging charge that his cautious strategy is putting lives at risk.In the wood-panelled state dining room of Number 10, flanked by chief medical officer Chris Whitty and chief scientific adviser Patrick Vallance, Mr Johnson said he was looking at all options for dealing with the disease but ""timing is crucial"".Mr Johnson has taken the politically risky strategy - underpinned by what he claims is the best medical and behavioural science - to avoid taking drastic measures now which he believes would be ineffective at best, counter-productive at worst.""The risk is that if we go too early people will understandably get fatigued and we won't be able to sustain it over time,"" said Prof Whitty.Mr Johnson's team accept that coronavirus will soon spread widely in the UK population but argue that it is not happening yet. Behavioural scientists have cautioned against early action of the kind seen in the EU.The prime minister believes that ordering people to stay away from work, closing schools or cancelling football matches would have little effect now, but would leave people fed up and less likely to comply in three to six weeks time, when the crisis might peak.Asked why he was not following the Italian example of restricting movement or stopping sporting events, Mr Johnson said: ""It is really vital as we take these steps to protect ourselves, we do it at the right time.""Some Number 10 insiders said that certain EU governments were bowing to political or media pressure to introduce measures that made little medical sense. France, for example, has banned gatherings of more than 1,000 people. Ireland has cancelled the annual St Patrick's day parade in Dublin, while Germany has urged its citizens to avoid public transport and walk or cycle to work instead.Sir Patrick said yesterday that he was carefully assessing which measures would be successful.

65,PM: drastic action will be taken at right time,"March 10, 2020 Tuesday",International,The Times (London),1040,1040,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,Chris Smyth,PM: drastic action will be taken at right time,"Everyone with minor coughs and colds will soon be told to stay at home for a week when the government steps up the fight against coronavirus.The elderly will also be advised to avoid public gatherings, Boris Johnson suggested as he urged Britain to ""pull together in a united and national effort"" to defeat the outbreak.The prime minister insisted that drastic measures had to be imposed ""at the right time"" as he resisted pressure to follow other countries in cancelling mass events and shutting schools, saying this could be counterproductive. Two more patients were confirmed to have died of the virus in Britain yesterday, as 46 new cases took the total to 319. Both were understood to be in their 70s with underlying health problems, with one woman dying at New Cross hospital in Wolverhampton and another patient at the Epsom and St Helier NHS Trust in Surrey.Most of the five people who have died so far in Britain contracted the virus in this country, and officials are increasingly concerned at the number of cases with no link to overseas travel, suggesting that Covid-19 is circulating extensively in parts of the UK.Professor Chris Whitty, the chief medical officer for England, said that everyone who is in hospital with pneumonia or other respiratory tract infections would now be tested for coronavirus, after dozens of cases were picked up by routine testing in intensive care.Although regular handwashing is the only general advice, Professor Whitty said: ""What we are moving now to is a phase when we will be having to ask members of the general public to do different things than they would normally do.""He added: ""We are now very close to the time, probably within the next ten to 14 days, when the modelling would imply we should move to a situation where we say everybody who has even minor respiratory tract infections or a fever should be self-isolating for seven days afterwards.""Such a move would be designed to contain potential cases, as the end of the winter flu seasons makes coughs and colds more likely to be coronavirus.Mr Johnson said that the next stage would include advice to the elderly, saying ""we will set out further steps in the days and weeks ahead to help people protect themselves, their family and in particularly the elderly and vulnerable"".He added that there was ""no hiding from the fact that the coronavirus outbreak will present significant challenges for the UK just as it does in other countries"".Officials hope they can halve infections and reduce deaths by a third and plans are based on scientific modelling predicting how potential measures could reduce infections and deaths, set against the social disruption they would cause.""No single intervention is enough on its own to make the difference. We have to do things in combination and we have to do them at the right time,"" Mr Johnson said.Last week he said he was continuing to shake hands but after he was requested not to do so at a Commonwealth Day service yesterday, Mr Johnson said: ""There's a good reason for not shaking hands, which is that the behavioural psychologists say that if you don't shake somebody's hand then that sends an important message to them about the importance of washing your hands. So there's a subliminal cue there to everybody to wash your hands.""After Rory Stewart, who stood against Mr Johnson for the Tory leadership last year, urged a more aggressive approach involving school closures, the prime minister defended his approach.""There's no question that this is going to become a significant, a much more significant outbreak than it currently is - that's obvious to everyone - but it is vital that we take the steps that we think are necessary at the right time and we follow the science,"" he said.""We mustn't do things which have no or limited medical benefit, nor things which could turn out actually to be counterproductive.""Cancelling sporting events and closing schools are not currently planned and Professor Whitty said: ""Anything we do, we have got to be able to sustain … There is a risk if we go too early people will understandably get fatigued and it will be difficult to sustain this over time.""AnalysisThe state's response to coronavirus is being driven by scientific modelling of each possible restriction - from banning hand-shaking to school closures - weighing up the potential benefit to health against its social cost (Chris Smyth writes).The results give the government a ""menu of options"" that functions more like a ladder. At the bottom are measures that are not too onerous, but could make a big difference, which is why advice to isolate yourself if you are ill will be the first step.The next stage is likely to focus on the elderly and other vulnerable groups, who could be advised to stay at home more.The model is informed by behavioural scientists, who fear that people would rebel against long-term draconian restrictions. This is why officials have not followed Italy in holding football matches behind closed doors. The model suggests people will watch in pubs instead, with a high risk of infection in confined spaces.At the top of the ladder are school closures. These are thought likely to have little effect because children will find ways of congregating.Shetland 2 The national picture of March 9, 5pm.  are 54 cases where location is unknown. is reported by local authority in England and health board in Scotland 1 case Ayrshire and Arran, Birmingham, Bradford, Buckinghamshire, Isle of Wight, Kingston upon Hull, City of Leicestershire, Lincolnshire, Milton Keynes, North Tyneside, Peterborough, Southend-on-Sea, Tameside, Tayside, Wirral Grampian 4 UK cases 2 Forth Valley 2 300+ Greater Glasgow Clyde 3 Cumbria Lanarkshire 3 Newcastle upon Tyne Lothian 5 Oldham Northern Ireland 12 Leeds York Lancashire 4 Bury 3 Bolton 2 Wigan 3 Barnsley Nottinghamshire Liverpool 4 Traord 4 Nottingham Manchester 5 Derbyshire ordshire 4 Northamptonshire Wales 6 Coventry 3 Warwickshire 3 Luton Hertfordshire 13 Gloucestershire 3 Oxfordshire 5 Swindon 2 Essex of Bristol 2 Medway Wiltshire 3 Kent 4 Somerset 2 London 51 Devon 12 Torbay 6 Cornwall 3 Brighton and Hove Surrey 5 West Sussex Wokingham 3 Bracknell Forest 2 Bournemouth, Christchurch and Poole 6 Hampshire 8",Newspaper
66,UK health chiefs promise more action on the way,"March 10, 2020 Tuesday",International,City A.M.,437,437,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,ANGHARAD CARRICK,UK health chiefs promise more action on the way,"THE UK's chief medical officer Chris Whitty last night warned that the government would soon ask people to change the way they usually live their lives in response to coronavirus.But the government for now insists that the best advice for the public is to wash their hands.The UK recorded its fifth death from the Covid-19 outbreak late last night, with an elderly patient at St. Helier hospital in south London succumbing to the disease.Whitty said the government is planning to advise anyone with showing symptoms that correlate with the virus to self-isolate for seven days to delay the spread of coronavirus.In a press conference with the Prime Minister and chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance, the UK's coronavirus tsar, said the advice will come into force in the ""near future"".He said in the next 10 to 14 days the government will have to advise everybody who has a minor respiratory tract infection or fever to self-isolate for seven days, in order to delay the epidemic.The NHS is currently screening everyone in intensive care for coronavirus if they have symptoms, but Whitty said the government will extend this from tomorrow to include everyone who has significant pneumonia or respiratory tract infection. Johnson said the UK remains in the containment phase of the government's plan but is making ""extensive preparations"" to move to the delay phase.He said that while the UK would stay in ""the contain phase of the outbreak... watching what is happening around the world our scientists believe that containment is unlikely to work on its own.""A delay would be expected to release pressure on the NHS, which could have resource issues if a sharp spike in coronavirus patients hit at the same time as other seasonal illnesses.Vallance said there are currently no plans in place to ban large gatherings, as other European countries have done as their coronavirus cases rise.He said: ""One person in a 70,000 seater stadium isn't going to infect the stadium.""Johnson added that it is ""absolutely critical in managing the spread of the virus that we make the right decisions at the right time"".Behavioural scientists have been engaged by Downing Street to plot how the public might respond.On Sunday France said it was banning all gatherings of more than 1,000 people, while Italy last night extended its quarantine to the entire country.Following reports that consumers were stockpiling everything from toilet paper to dried pasta as the number of confirmed coronavirus cases rose above 300, Johnson said the government would do everything it could ""to keep supermarkets stocked and support the economy"".",Newspaper
67,"Coronavirus: travel industry crisis sparks comparisons to 9/11 aftermath;As workers limit travel and would-be vacationers stay home, airlines, hotels and cruise companies face bleak outlook","March 10, 2020 Tuesday",International,The Guardian (London),856,856,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,Edward Helmore,"Coronavirus: travel industry crisis sparks comparisons to 9/11 aftermathAs workers limit travel and would-be vacationers stay home, airlines, hotels and cruise companies face bleak outlook","A flight between Shanghai and Chongqing now costs $4, about the price of a tall latte at Starbucks. Flights from New York to Miami were on offer for $51 last week, roughly the same as the cab fare from the airport to Manhattan. If Miami didn't appeal, you could have taken off for Paris for $278. The problem for the airline industry is: will anyone take them?As the coronavirus outbreak continues to hit stock markets hard, the travel industry is suffering its worst crisis in more than 18 years. Businesses have advised employees to avoid non-essential travel, conferences are cancelled, and would-be vacationers are avoiding foreign and domestic travel.The already bleak picture for airlines, hotels and cruise companies continued to darken on Monday as an oil price war and widening coronavirus infections bit deeply into investor confidence.So bad have things become that last week, Southwest's chief executive, Gary Kelly, warned the ""precipitous decline in bookings"" was similar to the drop the airline experienced after the September 11 terrorist attacks.""9/11 wasn't an economically driven issue for travel - it was more fear, quite frankly,'' he said. ""And I think that's really what's manifested this time ... It has a 9/11-like feel. Hopefully we'll get this behind us very quickly.''Comparisons to 9/11 are not exaggerated. The International Air Transport Association (Iata) trade body calculates that revenue worldwide this year could decline by between $63bn and $113bn, or as much as 20%. After 9/11, airline revenues fell by 7%, or $23bn, according to IATA.It's not just airlines. Cruise stocks plummeted harder still after the US state department warned US travelers, especially the elderly and those with underlying health issues, to avoid cruises.Shares of Carnival fell 19% on Monday, while Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings and Royal Caribbean fell more than 25%. In less than two months, the three US-based operators have lost more than $42bn in market capitalization, more than half of their value.""They will likely survive but no guarantees,"" C Patrick Scholes, an analyst at SunTrust, wrote in an email on Monday.That came as thousands of passengers on a third Princess Cruises ship were being kept onboard while crew members get tested for Covid-19. The Caribbean Princess, on a 10-day trip to the Panama Canal, was placed under a ""no sail order"" from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).That came as hotel industry stocks continued their declines. Over the first two months of the year, the Baird/STR Hotel Stock Index, a broad measure of the sector's health, has dropped 18.5%, according to the trade publication HospitalityNet.""Hotel stocks fell off a cliff at the end of the month due to mounting Covid-19 concerns domestically, and the broader stock market correction has disproportionately impacted travel-related stocks,"" Michael Bellisario, senior hotel research analyst and director at Baird, told the publication.The travel and leisure industry is one of the US's largest employers and the White House is worried. The White House chief economic adviser, Larry Kudlow, announced ""targeted measures"" to offset the negative impact on the industry from the coronavirus outbreak last week and Donald Trump, who recently signed an $8.3bn emergency coronavirus spending bill, met with airline executives to discuss the impact of the outbreak. The White House called another meeting with business leaders on Monday to discuss options.Any financial package would need the approval of Congress - difficult in an election year. Among the range of options open to the White House are tax deferments for industries hurt by the coronavirus outbreak, including the cruise, travel and airline industries.Improving public confidence in industries substantially affected by Covid-19 may be even more difficult than agreeing a bailout package given the level of uncertainty about the virus, how many will be affected and how long it will go on.According to the airline industry expert Robert Mann, the reaction of businesses to the threat does not necessarily match reality but the impact is still real.""I can understand businesses having a duty of care to employees, so saying 'if you don't want to travel, don't travel' is one thing. But saying flat out 'don't travel', that has implications for their businesses but also a lot of implications for the travel industry as a whole - airlines, hotels, rental cars, Uber, Lyft and all the related expenditures,"" he said.""This is a behavioral economics problem,"" Mann says. ""It's a situation where people throw probabilities out the window, react irrationally, and socially oriented businesses pay the price. The issue here is to get over the hysteria.""But with people dying and case numbers rising, worry is warranted right now, even if it proves to be short-lived. The consequences for some businesses are likely to be severe.""In the current crisis, a 30% drop in front-cabin, business traveler bookings represents of drop of roughly half in overall industry revenue,"" says McKenzie. ""I'd be surprised if we didn't see more airlines going out of business.""",Newspaper
68,"Nudge, nudge: how psychology is being used in coronavirus fight","March 11, 2020 Wednesday",International,thetimes.co.uk,1427,1427,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,"Matt Chorley, Red Box Editor","Nudge, nudge: how psychology is being used in coronavirus fight","People are annoying. They don't always do what they are told. Partly because of the way they are told.And in a serious health crisis like this coronavirus outbreak, being sure to tell people what to do, in the right way, is literally a matter of life and death.Which is where the ""nudge unit"" comes in. It was born out of an early David Cameron interest in the 2008 book, Nudge, by Richard Thaler, which explained how tweaking wording and changing defaults could gently push people towards saving energy, stopping smoking, saving money and even donating organs.Headed by David Halpern, the Behavioural Insights Team began life as a unit inside Whitehall, before being spun out as a stand-alone company advising governments around the world.And now it is playing a crucial role in the way the government is handling, and communicating, the coronavirus outbreak.First the basics of the problem. There is no getting away from it: it's snot. It is stuff coming out of your nose and mouth and then, in the technical jargon, ""going ballistic"".It settles on surfaces, and then you put your hand on it, and then put your hand in your eyes, nose, mouth or all three, and bingo. So one option in the fight against this potentially deadly virus is to hammer home the message that coughs and sneezes spread diseases, and another is to stop it ending up in your mouth.And that's where the nudge unit comes in. Trying to find easy-to-communicate ""circuit breaks"" to the spread of this virus. As Halpern tells me: ""Behaviour spreads through a population like a virus.""The Behavioural Insights Team now uses a website called Predictiv to test messages and images again and again to see what the public notice. Key messages or artwork flash up for a few seconds and then people are asked what they can remember. Subtle changes can make a big difference.Keen graphic designers want to make posters look nice. Behavioural psychologists want to make the message big.The official poster telling us to wash our hands went through several versions. The NHS logo is bigger because it reassures; the government coat of arms is smaller. Unnecessary text was cut. The original image used showed someone holding a vertical handrail on a bus but it was not clear to people in testing what it was. The door handle has now become the symbol of the message.Forget closing schools and offices and pubs and concerts and football matches. They are big generalisations which sound bold but at this stage have less impact on containing the disease than smaller specifics. The impact of the decision to postpone tonight's match between Manchester City and Arsenal will probably be greater on the wider population who now take messages about handwashing seriously, than the narrower threat to those playing or watching in the Etihad Stadium.Testing is under way on messaging for the next stage of dealing with the outbreak - ""social distancing"". One key thing you can do is stand three steps away from the next person. It hugely reduces the risk, is easy to do, and doesn't grind the economy to a halt.So it doesn't mean shutting all cinemas. ""If you are in a packed cinema it is a risk but if it's half empty and there are seats between you the risk is not very great,"" Halpern says. ""We are trying to zoom in on the things that really make a difference as opposed to things that make you feel good."" It might mean ensuring you have empty seats around you. So go and see Cats not 1917. Similarly transmission on planes is thought to be no more than one seat from yours. Train companies could be asked to put on more carriages off-peak so passengers do not need to sit near each other.This whole business is a mixture of science and common sense. And what sounds like common sense once a scientist has said it. And what sounds like science translated into English.The current advice on ""self-isolating"" will change because no one is quite sure what it means. The language will shift to ""stay at home"", but even that is being finessed after someone who has been self-isolating asked if they could go into their own garden.They could, but self-isolating had evoked images of E.T. in a plastic tent being kept alive by computers, whereas in most cases it actually means someone in pyjamas being kept alive by Homes Under the Hammer.The big battle for the nudge unit, though, remains cleaning. And getting us to clean to right things.In this crisis there is not a lot value in schools, offices or shopping centres cleaning floors. But there is a huge imperative to wash things which get touched a lot, especially door handles. ""Clean your knobs"" might not survive every level of testing but that is the basic message.That means cleaning handrails several times a day. It means not cleaning the windows of the bank but wiping the counter hourly. It means not mopping the supermarket floor but cleaning the trolley handles. ""Janitors and cleaners are on the front line, they are really important in the battle we are engaged in,"" says Halpern.Telling people to stop touching their face is tough, and often has the effect of making people think ""oh I've not touched my face, I should do that"".Telling people to wash their hands more is OK. Telling people to wash their hands before and after work is better. But finding a way to trigger behaviour automatically is the aim. Expect to see messages along the lines of ""take your coat off, wash your hands"".This will have the effect of stopping coronavirus entering your house, along with a whole load of other nasties. For those that don't get coronavirus, this whole episode is still an exercise in making us a bit better, healthier, cleaner.Not shaking hands on its own is not that significant. But everybody consciously changing behaviour - standing further apart, finding alternative greetings - might make a difference.Laboratories are testing the transfer risk of fist bumps verses elbow bumps. One idea being tested is advising people to touch their heart instead of shaking hands. It is all about making us less close, less tactile. More, well, British. Do not be surprised to see the prime minister in the coming days greeting someone in an unusual way. Other high-profile ""influencers"" could be called on to do the same.""If you just touch your heart it creates a reminder to stand a little bit further apart, because this is serious,"" Halpern says. ""I personally think the elbow bump is good. We are trying to get some sense of what people are finding effective.""There is also a live conversation going on in government about the level of testing. One theory goes that if almost everyone in the country was tested for coronavirus it might be very expensive but it would also shock those who think they are OK into realising they have Covid-19 and act accordingly. And that alone might be worth the hassle and cost.At present about 2,000 tests a day can be carried out in Public Health England laboratories but hospital labs will start carrying out large numbers of tests, with results promised in 24 hours.Look at the comments under any online story, or in any Facebook group you might be in, and you will simultaneously find those raging that this is media scaremongering and those wondering why everyone isn't writing their last will and testament.What the government has successfully managed to do over the past fortnight is move on from sniping about why the prime minister didn't chair Cobra initially, to overhyping possible draconian action which means anything falling short of that will seem sensible and measured.If two or three weeks ago Matt Hancock had suggested shutting all schools he would have been laughed out of town. When Rory Stewart did it this week it sounded like someone taking the threat more seriously than ministers.You do wonder though if Stewart, who let's not forget is running to be London mayor, is keen on coronavirus curbs now because he is worried that after going round to sleep on people's floors as an election stunt he might now be a super-spreader.The government is deferring to the scientists right now but the tension between science, politics and economics will grow.At what point do ministers start recommending things which will interfere with people's lives, and how long will people be expected to stick at it? Will this national effort unite the country or cause social tensions and lead to riots?One cabinet minister told me hopefully: ""It will bring us together as a nation, it's more 1944 than 2011.""This is a big crisis but it will be the small things, the small nudges, that make all the difference.",Newspaper; Web Publication

71,"The psychology of panic buying: why we're stockpiling toilet paper 'like zombies';Psychologists analyse our refusal to heed official shopping advice, and the widespread obsession with loo roll","March 11, 2020 Wednesday",International,telegraph.co.uk,1060,1060,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,By Rosa Silverman,"The psychology of panic buying: why we're stockpiling toilet paper 'like zombies'Psychologists analyse our refusal to heed official shopping advice, and the widespread obsession with loo roll","Supermarket shelves are being emptied quicker than they can be restocked; sanitising hand gel has become more precious than gold dust; some stores are rationing items; and at the start of this week, entire towns were said to be running low on toilet paper.There's little doubt we're in the grip of panic-buying, fuelled by fears around the rapid spread of coronavirus. And this despite - or perhaps because of - authorities repeatedly urging the public not to stockpile. As Prime Minister Boris Johnson put it, we should stop panic-buying and ""shop responsibly.""Why are so many people still filling up their trolleys with essentials? Psychologists say the phenomenon can be explained by various human behavioural traits - so what is the psychology of panic-buying when logically we know that 48 rolls of toilet paper is not going to save us?The first thing to note is that in a time of crisis (or perceived crisis), when we feel under threat, we commonly don't respond rationally. ""We act in a very irrational way and collect resources just to make sure we feel safe,"" says Dr Dimitrios Tsivrikos, a consumer and business psychologist at University College London. ""It's our own coping mechanism to deal with uncertainty."" Linda Blair, a clinical psychologist, agrees, pointing out that such behaviour is deep-rooted within us and can be traced back through the ages. ""We're letting our ancient history control us,"" she says.As she explains, when we are scared we don't deliberate and make decisions via the brain's cortex; we have an emotional response instead. ""[Panic-buying] is driven by emotion: you're letting fear lead you, rather than logic,"" she says.It is also driven by the fact that we are seeing other people do it. Humans are social animals and our behaviour is informed by what those around us are doing. In his 1984 book Influence, Robert Cialdini, an American professor of psychology and marketing, coined the term ""social proof"" to describe this phenomenon. Kate Nightingale, a consumer and fashion psychologist, sums it up: ""If the rest of my tribe or social group to which I need to belong to survive seems to be doing something, it's external confirmation [that it's worth doing].""We don't only do this at times of crisis either. ""Even in normal circumstances, if you see one product left on a shelf [you think] it means it must be good or important and other people have decided it must be safe to consume,"" she notes.Photos of empty shelves posted to social media, news reports on stockpiling and panic-buying, and seeing the empty shelves yourself when you walk into the supermarket, can all serve as social proof that such a response is necessary.The volume of communications about coronavirus to which we are exposed is also significant, say psychologists; because the more you hear about something, the greater your belief is that you will be affected by it.In 1973, psychologists Amos Tversky and Daniel Kahneman identified a mental shortcut humans take, which they labelled ""availability heuristic"". It sees us rely on immediate examples that come to mind when we consider a particular topic or decision. The more we are exposed to information, the more prominent it will be in our minds when we're making decisions or evaluating the risk of something happening to us.""We think the odds of us getting sick are way higher just because there's a case in our city, or because we've watched three pieces of news about it instead of one,"" says Nightingale. ""As soon as people are reminded of their mortality they become more impulsive and even more of their decisions become based on the subconscious shortcuts we tend to use.""[Even] when we're happy and healthy we're generally not good at making lots of rational decisions, and when we're in a state of fear... we behave even more subconsciously and impulsively because the fear takes over our conscious, cognitive ability to process pieces of information. We are effectively in what I like to call 'zombie mode'.""We have our innate negativity bias to contend with too. This means that negative information sticks in our minds for longer, we are more likely to mentally record it, and more likely to pass it on to other people. ""Images of supermarkets being empty, hand sanitisers being more expensive... all that drama is taking centre stage,"" says Dr Tsivrikos. ""Consumers are getting a picture that is incredibly dramatic and negative, and not in proportion to what is happening.""Again, this can drive us to act in a certain way, for instance by taking what we think are precautions to keep ourselves and our family safe. It may also give us a sense of control in a situation over which we have none. But while keeping the store cupboard stocked may not be a terrible idea, whether or not there's a virus circulating, there has been widespread bafflement about why some anxious consumers are frantically stockpiling loo roll. After all, the symptoms of coronavirus do not include stomach-related troubles.Dr Tsivrikos suggests the reason this particular item has been flying off the shelves relates to its physical size: ""It's a really massive product and it's low in value, so when people walk into a supermarket, they're buying the biggest volume product they have because they think it'll last them for longer,"" he says.Steven Taylor, author of The Psychology of Pandemics, takes a similar view: ""In the minds of people, big problems require big solutions. We're being told you shouldn't wear masks and you should wash your hands. We have a big problem and the government is giving us a little solution."" As a large item, toilet paper could physically satisfy our desire for a big solution. Not only this, but it is also associated with hygiene. And when a virus is spreading, our ""disgust sensitivity"" - our predisposition to experiencing disgust - increases, says Taylor, a professor and clinical psychologist in the psychiatry department of the University of British Columbia. ""People are trying to do something to take care of themselves and their disgust sensitivity is up.""He predicts that when self-testing kits become available, they too will be subject to panic-buying. ""Some people will be obsessively testing themselves to check they're safe,"" he says. ""It provides a false sense of safety. Just as toilet paper does.""•: The dos and don'ts of coronavirus self-isolation",Newspaper; Web Publication

75,Lockdown Dilemma;Boris Johnson has so far handled the coronavirus outbreak well but it is the decisions taken in the coming days upon which the government will be judged,"March 11, 2020 Wednesday",International,The Times (London),641,641,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,,Lockdown DilemmaBoris Johnson has so far handled the coronavirus outbreak well but it is the decisions taken in the coming days upon which the government will be judged,"For anyone still complacent about the seriousness of the coronavirus pandemic, the Italian government's decision to put the entire country into lockdown was a wake-up call. Until now it was possible to see pictures of Chinese citizens being buzzed back into their homes by drones, or read of school closures in Japan and quarantine restrictions in South Korea, and assume that this was a crisis playing out on the other side of the world. But the speed with which the outbreak has escalated in a big European country with a population of 60 million, and the measures it has felt necessary to take to prevent its healthcare system from being overwhelmed, have raised fears that similar steps will soon be needed here in Britain. After all, as of yesterday, the UK had 373 confirmed coronavirus cases, roughly the same as Italy reported 13 days ago. Today Italy has 10,149 cases and has suffered 631 deaths.Of course it's still possible that Britain will be able to avoid taking such extreme measures. It seems likely that at least part of the explanation for Italy's high death rate reflects early failures to identify infections and thereby contain the spread of the virus, which may have been circulating freely in the country's north. Britain has stepped up its own testing in recent days, which may lead to more successful isolation of those at risk. That will now include anyone in intensive care or in hospital with a respiratory infection. Nonetheless a growing number of new UK infections cannot be traced back to foreign sources, suggesting that it is now being passed on within Britain too. The government itself acknowledges that it may need to introduce much tougher measures soon.The decision of whether and when to introduce such measures is inevitably one of political judgment. So far Boris Johnson has allowed his response to the crisis to be driven by expert advice from the government's chief medical officer and chief scientific adviser. This advice in turn is being informed by a detailed model that draws heavily on insights from behavioural science as well as epidemiology and analysis of the likely impact of any decisions on the economy. But like all models, they are only as good as the underlying assumptions fed into them. Ultimately the prime minister must decide where the balance is to be struck between the economic disruption of following Italy down the path of lockdowns and the human cost in terms of increased deaths arising from pressures on the health service.For the time being the government continues to calculate that there is no need for the kind of measures introduced by Italy and other countries. It has told those suffering from feverish symptoms to stay at home but not imposed any wider restrictions on movement. Nor has it banned large public gatherings, as France has done, nor imposed any travel restrictions or introduced temperature checks at airports. It worries whether the kind of draconian quarantines imposed in parts of Asia would be obeyed in Britain or how they might be enforced. It appears determined to avoid shutting schools except as a last resort because of the knock-on implications for childcare, not least for critical NHS staff.Even so there are risks to delaying the response. The evidence from Asia, not least in Wuhan, where the crisis now appears to have passed, is that quarantine measures work. What's more, the parlous state of the NHS, including the acute shortage of intensive care beds and qualified staff, suggests that it would not take much for the health service to be overwhelmed. As infection rates rise, so too will public pressure on ministers to act. So far Mr Johnson appears to have handled this crisis adequately. But it is the choices he makes in the coming days which will be critical. And, as ever, the verdict will come with the benefit of hindsight.",Newspaper
76,"As a GP, I see how the challenge of coronavirus could help improve the NHS;From technology for remote consultations to better education about hygiene, Covid-19 is forcing the health service to evolve","March 11, 2020 Wednesday",International,The Guardian (London),764,764,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,Ann Robinson,"As a GP, I see how the challenge of coronavirus could help improve the NHSFrom technology for remote consultations to better education about hygiene, Covid-19 is forcing the health service to evolve","Covid-19, or more precisely the reaction to it, is playing havoc with our economic and healthcare institutions. So why is the waiting room in my surgery quieter than usual for this time of year? The sense among some other GP colleagues is that the NHS 111 phone line is doing a good job of directing possible cases to testing facilities in nearby hospitals (despite the stories of incorrect advice in some cases), while the worried well are staying away for fear of picking up something nasty in the surgery.Mind you, as one GP said to me: ""Don't jinx it. If you write that the waiting room is less busy, people will pile back. And anyway, this is just a temporary lull before a post-virus onslaught of all the saved-up problems."" The real worry is that some people are staying away who may be seriously unwell. The undiagnosed cancers, untreated pneumonias and poorly controlled angina, high blood pressure, diabetes and asthma that require medical intervention haven't gone away just because Covid-19 has stolen all the headlines.But there are some unintended positive consequences of the crisis. Of course Covid-19 is a highly undesirable, potentially dangerous and massively inconvenient nuisance at best, and a major threat to the public health at worst. But it has catalysed change and nudged behaviour in some interesting and useful ways. NHS 111 has been catapulted into a role as a highly effective, national fighting force. It's not perfect but it's rapidly improving, and is a resource to be proud of and grateful for. One should contrast it with the reports coming out in the US about the patchy approach to testing and management. Once this storm has passed - be in no doubt, however scary it seems now, it will - using NHS 111 as an information resource will be more firmly embedded in the national psyche.GPs have been offering phone consultations and communicating by text and email with patients for some time. But most of us haven't offered the Skype consultations that innovative (or predatory, depending on your take on it) outfits such as GP at Hand, backed by the AI platform Babylon, have. Now we're being forced into the 21st century at a dizzying pace. Cash-strapped clinical commissioning groups (CCGs) that until a few weeks ago had no spare money for anything are getting cash injections from the government to encourage us to see patients remotely. It's taken this modern plague to set up a system that should have happened long ago. It's likely to be so popular with our patients that it will be hard to ditch it.And another positive outcome is a level of personal hygiene among the public at large that has never been achieved before. Admittedly, it's not an edifying sight when people repeatedly try to nick the hand sanitiser from under the receptionist's nose. And some patients have been angry that we haven't been given supplies of sanitiser, masks and gloves to hand out to them. But I've been ostentatiously washing my hands to a couple of ""Happy Birthdays"" before each patient, which is a good habit that I should never have got out of in the first place.In the surgery, we've also become more conscious of the risk that our patients with poor immunity face every time they sit in our waiting room. This is true every winter when there are lots of people, a melange of viruses, long waits to be seen and, often, closed windows. We need to remember the lessons of this winter and find ways of making a trip to the doctor less likely to make you ill.A haematologist told me today that their patients, who are often extremely immunosuppressed and susceptible to life-threatening infections, are now asked to stay in their cars in the car park and are texted when it's time to nip up for the appointment. It's a great idea, which could be rolled out across the health service. Let's hope they don't stop this considerate approach when the dust settles.It's not all good news, though. The disruption to travel risks jeopardising vital supplies for healthcare. Perhaps Brexit planning means that supply chains and contingencies are in place; that would be a welcome silver lining. But stem cells needed for vital bone marrow transplants for patients with blood cancers are sometimes brought in from countries such as Germany, and there is a real concern that            couriers may not be able to travel to bring the precious cells. The more UK residents who are potential donors, the less reliant we will need to be on imported cells. If Covid-19 persuades more people to sign up to save lives, that would be a truly heroic response. Ann Robinson is a GP",Newspaper
77,Coronavirus: China proved singing happy birthday while washing hands is not enough to combat virus. Why aren't we listening?;No travel bans and no social distancing measures enforced in UK despite rising number of deaths,"March 12, 2020 Thursday",International,The Independent (United Kingdom),961,961,England & Wales,Harry Cockburn,Coronavirus: China proved singing happy birthday while washing hands is not enough to combat virus. Why aren't we listening?No travel bans and no social distancing measures enforced in UK despite rising number of deaths,"The coronavirus death toll in the UK stands at 10, and a total of 590 people are known to have been infected, yet the British government is staving off putting official restrictions on mass gatherings or on travel.Health experts have pointed out that by the time 400 known cases of the virus were detected in Wuhan, the epicentre of the outbreak, the city was shutdown by Chinese authorities. The following day, another 15 cities in Hubei - a province with 58 million people - were shut down to contain the virus.Of course, at the time of the shutdowns, the true number of cases was much higher than 400 in China, and subsequent identification of those infected only began to reveal the immediate effectiveness of the lockdowns around a week later.In fact, at the time of the lockdowns, around 2,500 would have been infected, official records show.These numbers are known through testing people and then asking them when they first began to suffer from the symptoms of the disease, indicating around a week-long lag in China between beginning to feel ill, and then being diagnosed. Lockdowns, self isolations and social distancing tactics have helped China ""flatten the curve"" - referring to the shape of the line on graphs plotting the numbers of cases of the disease over time.Graph shows rapid effectiveness of Chinese lockdowns (Journal of the American Medical Association)Without such measures being adopted, graphs spike as the number of cases soars.China's rapid containment efforts were applauded by the World Health Organization at the time, and as the number of cases in the country has fallen by the day - there were only eight new cases in the epicentre, Wuhan, on Wednesday - focus is now turning to other countries such as Iran and Italy, which are yet to show signs of a slowdown in infections. Knowledge of the coronavirus death rate, the level of infection, and the speed at which the disease has moved through population centres has also enabled scientists to make estimates of numbers of undiagnosed infections in populations based on the death rate. A relatively small number of deaths can represents hundreds or thousands of infections.In the UK, which has a population only slightly greater than Hubei, with 66.4 million, the government has repeatedly said it is following scientists' advice. But that has been refuted by numerous scientists ,and earlier this week the editor-in-chief of health journal The Lancet claimed the government was ""playing roulette with the public"" by not following scientists' advice on containing the virus.The former regional director of Public Health England, Professor John Ashton, also issued a furious condemnation of what he described as the UK government's ""complacent"" response to the pandemic, saying he was ""tearing his hair out"", and measures should have been put in place a month ago.So while China's tactic of quarantining 58 million people appears to have worked, in the UK, the government is daring to try an untested alternative led by its ""nudge unit"" also known as the Behavioural Insights Team - a private company partly owned by the Cabinet Office, employees and the charity Nesta.The nudge unit's chief executive, Dr David Halpern, whose background is in politics and strategy, rather than biological science, reports directly to Boris Johnson and is among those advising the government on its coronavirus response.Speaking to the BBC, Dr Halpern said: ""There's going to be a point, assuming the epidemic flows and grows as it will do, where you want to cocoon, to protect those at-risk groups so they don't catch the disease.""By the time they come out of their cocooning, herd immunity has been achieved in the rest of the population.""So far, the government is refusing to ban mass gatherings, close institutions or, as Donald Trump has done, to close borders to mainland Europe. Instead, the UK government has advised those with any symptoms to self-isolate, and urged vulnerable elderly people to remain indoors.On Thursday, Chancellor Rishi Sunak told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""The advice we are getting is that there is not evidence that interventions like closing borders or travel bans are going to have a material effect on the spread of the infections.""That is why we have taken the decisions that we have.""In South Korea, which has seen a rapid rate of officially recorded infections, almost 20,000 people each day are being tested for coronavirus - more people per capita than anywhere else in the world.The South Korea authorities managed to design and create a test, then set up a network of laboratories across the country and get it all to work in 17 days.According to health officials, this rapid response and huge roll-out could well be saving lives, the BBC reported. According to the World Health Organization, the death rate for coronavirus is 3.4 per cent. But in South Korea it has been just 0.7 per cent. Members of South Korea's reserve forces wearing protective gear prepare to spray antiseptic solution to guard against coronavirus.

He, and the entire first-team squad and coaching staff, will now be self-isolating in accordance with the most recent government guidelines.Chelsea announced Hudson-Odoi, 19, had tested positive with COVID-19 at around midnight and said the training facility in Cobham, Surrey, will be partially closed.Chelsea staff who had recent close contact with the winger will also self-isolate, the club said in a statement. The player posted a video on Twitter this morning (Friday), thanking fans for their good wishes and confirming he will be self isolating.He said: 'As you may be aware I had the virus for the last couple of days which I have recovered from. I'm following the health guidelines and self-isolating myself from everybody for the week. Hope to see everybody soon and hopefully be back on the pitch very soon.'The Premier League will hold an emergency meeting via conference call at 10.30am on Friday to decide if and how to proceed with the remaining fixtures of the season.Earlier today Prime Minister Boris Johnson chaired a meeting of Cobra emergency committee in which he refused to ban mass gatherings or shut schools despite saying 'many loved ones' will die during the escalating crisis. Arsenal were due to play Brighton on Saturday, but the South Coast club announced this evening that the match is postponed. . It is understood Arteta did not come into contact with Olympiakos owner Evangelos Marinakis, who also tested positive, during their Europa League game on February 27. There are over 590 confirmed cases of the virus in the UK, and 10 people have died from it so far. Nearly 5,000 people have died worldwide, and the number of cases has shot up to over 130,000.The prime minister today branded the virus the 'worst public health crisis in a generation' and warned that 'many more' people are going to die, but still held off drastic measures. At a press conference in Westminster, Mr Johnson formally declared that the UK's tactics have shifted from 'containing' the killer disease to merely 'delaying' its inevitable spread, after he chaired a meeting of the Cobra emergency committee. Mr Johnson said it was clear the disease will continue to spread around the world and people should brace for the 'reality' of 'severe disruption' for many months. The Government's new plan urges anyone with even mild coronavirus-like symptoms - a persistent cough or a fever - to quarantine themselves at home and to sleep alone if possible and stay at least two metres from relatives.The PM has also recommended all overseas school trips be cancelled while people over the age of 70 or those with pre-existing serious medical conditions have been told not to go on cruises.But he stopped short of more extreme measures such as closing schools and banning mass gatherings which have been adopted in Ireland, Norway, France and Italy in an effort to stem the spread of the virus.Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said this evening that Scotland was shutting down public events 'that have the potential to have an impact on our frontline emergency services'. Mr Johnson said the UK would not close schools yet even though government advisers admitted the move would help stem the outbreak. Advisers said the length of closure necessary to make the measure work could be more than 16 weeks and would at this stage therefore not be feasible. Chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance also said today he believed the true number of infections was likely to be 5,000-10,000 already. He estimated that the UK was four weeks behind the trajectory of the crisis in Italy - which has brought the country to its knees.The peak of the outbreak in the UK might not come for 10 to 14 weeks, the experts said - suggesting it will run into June. As a result of their manager's diagnosis, Arsenal's upcoming fixtures look unlikely to go ahead. The club is now attempting to track down anyone who has had close contact with Arteta in recent times. It is widely expected that Chelsea's next two games against Aston Villa on Saturday and Bayern Munich on Wednesday in the Champions League will no longer go ahead.The game in Germany was set to go ahead behind closed doors but Hudson-Odoi's diagnosis has thrown any chance of fulfilling that game next week in serious doubt. A spokesperson for the club said the teenage midfielder became unwell and had the symptoms of a 'mild cold' and hoped their staff will be back to work soon. The statement said: 'Chelsea men's team player Callum Hudson-Odoi had a positive test result for Coronavirus returned this evening [Thursday]. 'Chelsea personnel who had recent close contact with the player in the men's team building will now self-isolate in line with Government health guidelines. These will include initially the full men's team squad, coaching staff and a number of backroom staff.'It is expected that those who did not have close contact with Callum will return to work in the coming days. In the meantime, the men's team building, one of several separate buildings at our training ground, will remain closed. The rest of our training facility, Stamford Bridge and our other facilities are operating as normal.'Callum displayed symptoms similar to a mild cold on Monday morning and has not been at the training ground since then as a precaution. However, his test came in positive this evening and he will undergo a period of self-isolation. Despite testing positive for the virus, Callum is doing well and looking forward to returning to the training ground as soon as it is possible.'If Arsenal now cannot fulfil their fixtures in the next two weeks because their players are self-isolation, that also puts their FA Cup quarter-final with Sheffield United on March 22 at risk. Arsenal said in a statement: 'It is clear we will not be able to play some fixtures on their currently scheduled dates. We will update supporters who have tickets for forthcoming games with more information as soon as possible.' Arsenal's under-23 game on Friday against Tottenham, plus their under-18 against Reading and under-16 against Boreham Wood on Saturday will all be postponed, the club said. One proposal in Friday's Premier League meeting, which will be held as a conference call in the morning, will be to postpone all games until the international break later this month when they could be rescheduled. It could also see all the remaining Premier League fixtures played behind closed doors.Arsenal played Olympiacos in the Europa League a couple of weeks ago, and since then the Greek club's owner Evangelos Marinakis has tested positive for the virus. Wolves' match against Olympiacos on Thursday evening was played behind closed doors as a precaution. Most of Europe's top leagues have either suspended matches or will play games with no crowd until further notice. Arsenal have closed down the London Colney training centre after the manager received a postitive COVIC-19 result on Thursday evening. First team players participated in a training session there on Tuesday afternoon.

Both training centres will undergo a deep clean.Anyone who has not come into close contact with Arteta is expected to return to work within the next few days. Arteta said: 'This is really disappointing but I took the test after feeling poorly. I will be at work as soon as I'm allowed.' The news came less than an hour after the Premier League announced that this weekend's fixtures would be going ahead as planned. However, in the light of this development, the Premier League will now be holding an emergency meeting on Friday morning regarding future fixtures. A statement said: 'In light of Arsenal's announcement tonight confirming that their first-team coach Mikel Arteta has tested positive for COVID-19, the Premier League will convene an emergency club meeting tomorrow morning regarding future fixtures.'The Premier League will make no further comment until after that meeting.' Over the past week, Arsenal have played against Portsmouth in the FA Cup, and West Ham in the Premier League. Handshakes were banned for the Premier League match, however Arteta still came into physical contact with a number of people during the game. He fist bumped Bukayo Saka at full-time, and also embraced assistant manager Albert Stuivenberg, after hugging rival manager David Moyes before the game.Juventus revealed on Thursday that 121 people, including players, directors, and staff are now in self-isolation after defender Daniele Rugani tested positive for coronavirus. Sampdoria striker Manolo Gabbiadini has also tested positive, with Italy one of the worst-hit countries. Three Leicester players are in self-isolation and Chelsea have cancelled a training session in order to deep clean their own facility. Manchester City defender Benjamin Mendy is also in self-isolation after one of his family members tested positive. Real Madrid's match against Manchester City in the Champions League has been called off as the entire club has gone into a 15-day quarantine amid the crisis. On an unprecedented day of cancellations football league programmes in Spain, Portugal, Holland and the United States were suspended alongside postponements in rugby, tennis, golf, basketball and athletics, while England's Test series in Sri Lanka that is due to start next week came under threat and more doubts were raised over whether this summer's European Championship and Olympics will take place as planned. Will it be enough?

'At all stages we have been guided by the science. We will do the right thing at the right time,' Mr Johnson said. The number of UK cases has risen by 130 and the death toll hit 10 in the last 24 hours, with experts increasingly bracing for turmoil as the overwhelming majority of the population becomes infected and the country develops 'herd immunity'. But chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance said he believed the true number of infections was likely to be 5,000-10,000 already. He estimated that the UK was four weeks behind the trajectory of the crisis in Italy - which has brought the country to its knees.The peak of the outbreak in the UK might not come for 10-14 weeks, the experts said - suggesting it will run into June. Mr Johnson insisted comparisons to seasonal flu were wrong. 'This is more dangerous and it's going to spread further. And I must level with you and the British public: more families, many more families, are going to lose loved ones before their time,' he said. Despite the bloodcurdling warnings, Mr Johnson said the UK would not close schools yet even though government advisers admitted the move would help stem the outbreak. Advisers said the length of closure necessary to make the measure work could be more than 16 weeks and would at this stage therefore not be feasible. Chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance said it was not realistic to expect children to be cooped up that long. He said: 'It is true that there is some effect in closing schools but that effect is minimal and actually you would have to do it for 13 to 16 weeks or longer.'You do not have to be a very advanced mathematician to work out that the chances of keeping children not speaking to each other or playing with each other are zero.'Closing down schools could also put elderly grandparents at risk if they were asked to look after children, who are believed to be less susceptible to the most severe form of the disease but can still spread it.'The scientific advice is that this could do more harm than good,' Mr Johnson said. 'But we are keeping this under review and this could change as the disease spreads. Schools should only close if they are specifically advised to do so.'Mr Johnson conceded that Scotland was already banning mass gatherings, but suggested there was a 'particular issue with the resilience of their public services' north of the border, in a perceived swipe at Nicola Sturgeon after she undermined him by announcing her plans first.                     How the UK's coronavirus 'battle plan' could unfold                    CONTAIN Testing individuals reporting symptoms or returning from infected areas, isolating those who have coronavirus.Tracing how they contracted the virus, and everyone they might have come into contact with while infectious.Powers have been taken to force people into quarantine if they refuse to comply voluntarily.

'We are not saying no to that sort of measures, of course not,' Mr Johnson said. 'We are keeping it up our sleeves. But it is very important... that we get the timing right.' Chief medical officer Prof Chris Whitty added: 'We need to do it at the last point it is reasonable so people maintain their energy and enthusiasm... it is important we do not ask our fellow citizens to do it for longer than makes sense.' The FTSE plunged by more than 10 per cent today in response to the dramatic US announcement of a travel ban from Europe overnight, and growing global chaos. And in the latest high-profile victim of the outbreak, BT's chief executive, Philip Jansen, tested positive for COVID-19 on Thursday.'Having felt slightly unwell I decided as a precaution to be tested. As soon as the test results were known I isolated myself at home,' Jansen said in a statement. 'I've met several industry partners this week so felt it was the responsible thing to do to alert them to this fact as soon as I could.'Jansen said his symptoms seemed mild and he would work remotely over the coming week, avoiding disruption to the business of Britain's biggest telecoms group. The UK approach is increasingly at odds with that of other countries, with Ireland joining the list of those closing all schools and colleges and banning mass gatherings. In the first sign of splits within the UK, Nicola Sturgeon has declared that Scotland will also cancelling events with more than 500 people from the start of next week, saying that they take up too much time for emergency services.She admitted: 'These are not easy judgements. They are difficult and complicated.'The government has also made clear it will not follow Donald Trump's dramatic overnight move of closing the borders to travellers from mainland Europe. Instead Mr Johnson seems determined to take a limited response, asking those with a cold to self-quarantine, and urge vulnerable elderly people to stay indoors.Former Cabinet minister Rory Stewart this afternoon accused the PM of 'smug insular complacency, warning that without quick action there could be 100,000 cases in the UK within the next 24 days.'This is at risk of becoming an example of smug insular complacency - refusing to pay any attention to what any other country is doing or the successful public health approach in Asia,' the London Mayor hopeful said. 'We should show some humility, learn from others and act now.' Ms Sturgeon said this evening that Scotland was shutting down public events 'that have the potential to have an impact on our frontline emergency services'.'This is not a move that we are making because the science has told us it will have a significant impact on the spread of the virus: on the contrary, the scientists tell us it will not have a significant impact on the spread of the virus - although no significant impact does not equate to no impact at all,' she said.'But there are wider reasons that I consider and have judged that are important in reaching this decision.'                     Early lockdown 'can cut coronavirus infections'                    Shocking charts show how the UK Government could prevent hundreds or even thousands of deaths by taking dramatic action now to fight the killer coronavirus and 'flatten the curve' of its spiralling epidemic.Prime Minister Boris Johnson today decided not to move forward in Britain's fight against COVID-19, declining to close schools, send people home from work or ban large gatherings.But he is coming under intense scrutiny for refusing to budge - one frustrated scientist warned: 'Now is the time for the UK government to ban large gatherings, ask people to stop non-essential travel, recommend employers shift to home working and ramp up the response.'Official advice currently doesn't go much further than telling citizens to wash their hands even though the UK now has more cases than China did when Wuhan's 11million people were forced into lockdown.Scientists and critics are urging the Government to do more to prolong an inevitable surge in cases, saying that a spike of infections could cripple the NHS but spreading the cases over a longer period of time would 'flatten the curve' and make it easier for the nation to cope. An analysis of statistics has shown that areas that acted fast have slashed their death rates by up to eight times compared to those who react after the virus has taken hold.In South Korea, for example, an area home to 2.5million people was put into lockdown when just 204 people had been diagnosed and one had died. The country now has a death rate of just 0.8 per cent despite more than 7,800 cases.But in Italy, large-scale lockdowns were not brought in until Sunday, March 8, by which time it had more than 5,800 patients. There are now almost 12,500 and 827 deaths - a death rate of 6.6 per cent. 'Certain events, whether or not they need dedicated ambulance cover, we know that certain events have an impact on our policing and our front-line health services, accident and emergency and ambulance services.'At a time when pressure on those services is going to be considerable ... it is incumbent on government to do what we can to remove unnecessary burdens on our public services.'The decision is set to come into force the day after Rangers host Celtic in one of this weekend's Ladbrokes Premiership fixtures, with the champions currently 13 points clear of their rivals.Prof Whitty said the UK would not be introducing social distancing measures yet as it was not the right moment within the pandemic.But he warned that advice would be coming for elderly and vulnerable people to isolate themselves from social gatherings.He said: 'The next stage along we are going to want to do a package of things that are about putting social distancing around the people who are older and those with severe health conditions.'But we do not think it is appropriate to make a national recommendation for that at the moment because it is too early in the course of the epidemic.'If you think about what would happen if you prematurely put elderly or vulnerable in a situation where you're saying, we really want to cut down on your social interactions, to cut back on your contact with others, it has big practical implications for them and may lead to loneliness and other issues which are clearly very undesirable for them.'While we will need to move to that stage, we do not think this is the right moment along the pandemic to do so. But that point will come.'Eariler, Mr Johnson swiped at political leaders who do not 'follow the science'. In comments made before Mr Trump's announcement, he said many leaders were 'under a lot of pressure to be seen to act'. Asked whether the PM knew of Mr Trump's escalation in advance, Downing Street said today: 'UK and US officials are in regular contact.' To fight what is now officially a global pandemic, the Budget handed hospitals a £5billion fighting fund while thousands of firms will be given a business rates holiday to help avert the risk of bankruptcy.Sick pay will be reformed to ensure that employees are not penalised for going into quarantine. In a round of interviews today, Mr Sunak told the BBC: 'I make absolutely no apology for responding in the short term in scale to the immediate threat that we face from coronavirus. 'I think that's the right thing to do for the economy, we need to help businesses have a bridge to get to the other side.'His package came as the Bank of England's base rate was slashed to an historic low of just 0.25 per cent.Mr Johnson will confirm today that the UK is switching from a strategy of trying to contain the outbreak to one of trying to delay its worst effects in order to give the NHS more time to cope. The Prime Minister - one of whose Cabinet ministers went into self-isolation last night along with five other MPs - is also likely to announce a range of social-distancing measures.However, the government is not expected to go as far as Donald Trump, who yesterday told Americans he was ordering an immediate shut-down of all travel from Europe. Irish PM Leo Varadkar has declared that schools, colleges and childcare facilities are to close for two weeks.He made a live statement to the nation from Washington DC, where he is due to meet Mr Trump later as part of the annual St Patrick's Day programme of events.

'Unfortunately we must face the tragic reality that some people will die,' he said.Mr Varadkar said he was acting on fresh advice from the country's National Public Health Emergency Team.'The virus is all over the world, it will continue to spread but it can be slowed,' he said. Dr David Halpern, head of the UK's Behavioural Insights Team dubbed Britain's 'Nudge Unit' who reports directly to Mr Johnson, has suggested the 500,000 people in UK care homes or with respiratory conditions could be the only people protected.He has suggested the virus can be beaten by letting it spread through healthy people to kill it off rather than a nationwide lockdown that could allow coronavirus to rise again later in the year.Dr Halpern has revealed ministers are considering a policy of keeping high-risk groups such as the elderly or those with underlying health conditions isolated in care homes or in their own homes over the coming months.He said: 'There's going to be a point, assuming the epidemic flows and grows as it will do, where you want to cocoon, to protect those at-risk groups so they don't catch the disease.'By the time they come out of their cocooning, herd immunity has been achieved in the rest of the population'.  Deputy chief medical officer Jenny Harries was asked on the BBC if 'pretty much everyone will get it eventually'.Speaking hours after world health officials declared the coronavirus a pandemic, Trump repeatedly defended his own actions and vowed the nation would prevail in countering the virus and getting treatment on the market.'We will be suspending all travel from Europe to the United States for the next 30 days,' Trump announced, in a speech from the Oval Office to the nation. 'The new rules will go into effect Friday at midnight,' he said. The move was so sudden the acting Homeland Security secretary said he would issue full guidance on how to carry it out within 48 hours.The White House said the travel restrictions would apply to foreign nationals who have visited 26 European countries - but excluding the UK and Ireland - in the past 14 days. It will not apply to US citizens, their 'immediate' family members or legal permanent residents. But confusion remained over how exactly the rules would apply and in what time zone the deadline would be introduced. Chancellor Rishi Sunak today said the UK was not following the US example.'The advice we are getting is that there is not evidence that interventions like closing borders or travel bans are going to have a material effect on the spread of the infections,' he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. 'That is why we have taken the decisions that we have.'

Schools should only close if they are specifically advised to do so.'Mr Johnson conceded that Scotland was already banning mass gatherings, but suggested there was a 'particular issue with the resilience of their public services' north of the border, in a perceived swipe at Nicola Sturgeon after she undermined him by announcing her plans first.'We are not saying no to that sort of measures, of course not,' Mr Johnson said. 'We are keeping it up our sleeves. But it is very important... that we get the timing right.' [item name=video id=4181592 style=2 /]Chief medical officer Prof Chris Whitty added: 'We need to do it at the last point it is reasonable so people maintain their energy and enthusiasm... it is important we do not ask our fellow citizens to do it for longer than makes sense.' The FTSE plunged by more than 10 per cent today in response to the dramatic US announcement of a travel ban from Europe overnight, and growing global chaos. And in the latest high-profile victim of the outbreak, BT's chief executive, Philip Jansen, tested positive for COVID-19 on Thursday.'Having felt slightly unwell I decided as a precaution to be tested. As soon as the test results were known I isolated myself at home,' Jansen said in a statement. 'I've met several industry partners this week so felt it was the responsible thing to do to alert them to this fact as soon as I could.'Jansen said his symptoms seemed mild and he would work remotely over the coming week, avoiding disruption to the business of Britain's biggest telecoms group. The UK approach is increasingly at odds with that of other countries, with Ireland joining the list of those closing all schools and colleges and banning mass gatherings. In the first sign of splits within the UK, Nicola Sturgeon has declared that Scotland will also cancelling events with more than 500 people from the start of next week, saying that they take up too much time for emergency services.She admitted: 'These are not easy judgements. They are difficult and complicated.'The government has also made clear it will not follow Donald Trump's dramatic overnight move of closing the borders to travellers from mainland Europe. Instead Mr Johnson seems determined to take a limited response, asking those with a cold to self-quarantine, and urge vulnerable elderly people to stay indoors.Former Cabinet minister Rory Stewart this afternoon accused the PM of 'smug insular complacency, warning that without quick action there could be 100,000 cases in the UK within the next 24 days.'This is at risk of becoming an example of smug insular complacency - refusing to pay any attention to what any other country is doing or the successful public health approach in Asia,' the London Mayor hopeful said. 'We should show some humility, learn from others and act now.' On another day of frantic activity by politicians and health experts around the globe: How the UK's coronavirus 'battle plan' could unfold  CONTAIN Testing individuals reporting symptoms or returning from infected areas, isolating those who have coronavirus.Tracing how they contracted the virus, and everyone they might have come into contact with while infectious.Powers have been taken to force people into quarantine if they refuse to comply voluntarily. This stage of the UK's response has now ended.DELAY Ministers have ordered wider testing to assess prevalence in the community. Anyone with coronavirus-like symptoms is being asked to self-isolate.Sick pay provision has been bolstered to make the self-employed and low-paid workers more likely to comply. Further up the so-called 'ladder' of response options, vulnerable people could be urged to stay indoors, schools could be closed, and sports and public gatherings could be banned. Ministers say the scientific advice does not yet support that - although Ireland is closing schools, and Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon is banning gatherings of more than 500 people.The government has also rejected the US approach of barring travellers from mainland Europe for the moment. MITIGATE If the outbreak runs out of control, the NHS could cancel all non-urgent activity to focus on treating those affected.In an extreme situation, troops could be deployed to shore up the police and essential public services.Recently-retired doctors and nurses would be brought back to help plug gaps in the NHS, with many health workers expected to be infected along with regular members of the public. •Irish PM Leo Varadkar has declared that schools, colleges and childcare facilities are to close for two weeks;•Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon today declared that she is 'minded' to cancel mass gatherings of over 500 people from the start of next week to avoid them sucking up resources for police and health workers;•The US Congress is shutting the Capitol, House and Senate office buildings to public until April 1 in reaction to coronavirus;•The Electoral Commission has called for the local and mayoral polls due in May to be postponed until the Autumn;•The UK and the EU jointly announced that face to face Brexit trade talks next week would not go ahead as planned but they could be conducted using video technology;•The FTSE 100 fell by more than 9 per cent today as investors were rattled by US travel restrictions imposed by in an attempt to halt the pandemic;•The Czech Republic is closing its borders to travellers crossing from Germany and Austria and also banning the entry of foreigners coming from other risky countries to contain the coronavirus outbreak;•Norway and Lithuania are shutting down nurseries, schools and universities for at least two weeks, and Oslo has told workers to stay at least one metre apart in offices;•Labour has cancelled a conference to announce the results of its leadership contest, saying the replacement for Jeremy Corbyn will now be declared at a 'scaled back' event on April 4;•Canadian PM Justin Trudeau has self-isolated while his wife awaits the results of a coronavirus test;•The WHO warned that the travel ban announced by Mr Trump will do little to help combat coronavirus in the UK and could backfire by making people complacent;•Mr Sunak said he made 'no apology' for turning on the spending taps to counter the effects of the virus on the UK economy and society;•A Cabinet minister is awaiting the results of a coronavirus test today, with four other MPs in quarantine after health minister Nadine Dorries became the first politician to be diagnosed with the disease;•Tube and transport systems were quieter than usual as the public preempted the expected advice from government on restricting social contact;•Sporting events have been called off, with golf set to be played without crowds and the tennis tour put on hold for six weeks;•Sittings in Parliament could be scaled back and the authorities are considering closing to visitors amid fears of spread on the estate.[item name=video id=4181368 style=2 /][item name=video id=4181366 style=2 /]Early lockdown 'can cut coronavirus infections' Shocking charts show how the UK Government could prevent hundreds or even thousands of deaths by taking dramatic action now to fight the killer coronavirus and 'flatten the curve' of its spiralling epidemic.Prime Minister Boris Johnson today decided not to move forward in Britain's fight against COVID-19, declining to close schools, send people home from work or ban large gatherings.But he is coming under intense scrutiny for refusing to budge - one frustrated scientist warned: 'Now is the time for the UK government to ban large gatherings, ask people to stop non-essential travel, recommend employers shift to home working and ramp up the response.'Official advice currently doesn't go much further than telling citizens to wash their hands even though the UK now has more cases than China did when Wuhan's 11million people were forced into lockdown.Scientists and critics are urging the Government to do more to prolong an inevitable surge in cases, saying that a spike of infections could cripple the NHS but spreading the cases over a longer period of time would 'flatten the curve' and make it easier for the nation to cope. An analysis of statistics has shown that areas that acted fast have slashed their death rates by up to eight times compared to those who react after the virus has taken hold.In South Korea, for example, an area home to 2.5million people was put into lockdown when just 204 people had been diagnosed and one had died. The country now has a death rate of just 0.8 per cent despite more than 7,800 cases.But in Italy, large-scale lockdowns were not brought in until Sunday, March 8, by which time it had more than 5,800 patients. There are now almost 12,500 and 827 deaths - a death rate of 6.6 per cent. Ms Sturgeon said this evening that Scotland was shutting down public events 'that have the potential to have an impact on our frontline emergency services'.'This is not a move that we are making because the science has told us it will have a significant impact on the spread of the virus: on the contrary, the scientists tell us it will not have a significant impact on the spread of the virus - although no significant impact does not equate to no impact at all,' she said.'But there are wider reasons that I consider and have judged that are important in reaching this decision.''Certain events, whether or not they need dedicated ambulance cover, we know that certain events have an impact on our policing and our front-line health services, accident and emergency and ambulance services.'At a time when pressure on those services is going to be considerable ... it is incumbent on government to do what we can to remove unnecessary burdens on our public services.'The decision is set to come into force the day after Rangers host Celtic in one of this weekend's Ladbrokes Premiership fixtures, with the champions currently 13 points clear of their rivals.Prof Whitty said the UK would not be introducing social distancing measures yet as it was not the right moment within the pandemic.But he warned that advice would be coming for elderly and vulnerable people to isolate themselves from social gatherings.He said: 'The next stage along we are going to want to do a package of things that are about putting social distancing around the people who are older and those with severe health conditions.'But we do not think it is appropriate to make a national recommendation for that at the moment because it is too early in the course of the epidemic.'If you think about what would happen if you prematurely put elderly or vulnerable in a situation where you're saying, we really want to cut down on your social interactions, to cut back on your contact with others, it has big practical implications for them and may lead to loneliness and other issues which are clearly very undesirable for them.'While we will need to move to that stage, we do not think this is the right moment along the pandemic to do so. But that point will come.'Eariler, Mr Johnson swiped at political leaders who do not 'follow the science'. In comments made before Mr Trump's announcement, he said many leaders were 'under a lot of pressure to be seen to act'. Asked whether the PM knew of Mr Trump's escalation in advance, Downing Street said today: 'UK and US officials are in regular contact.' To fight what is now officially a global pandemic, the Budget handed hospitals a £5billion fighting fund while thousands of firms will be given a business rates holiday to help avert the risk of bankruptcy.Sick pay will be reformed to ensure that employees are not penalised for going into quarantine. In a round of interviews today, Mr Sunak told the BBC: 'I make absolutely no apology for responding in the short term in scale to the immediate threat that we face from coronavirus. 'Sleep alone, don't go for a walk and don't shake your dirty laundry': Government issues advice for people self-isolating   The Government issued a how-to guide for people forced to quarantine this afternoon.It came as Boris Johnson and his medical advisers said anyone with symptoms of coronavirus should stay at home for seven days. The guidance provides practical advice, including keeping away from all other human beings as much as possible.It includes: •You cannot go for a walk but you can use your own garden.•You can buy food and other supplies online but you must warn drivers to leave goods outside and do not invite them in.•Stay in a well-ventilated room with a window that can be opened.•Stay in a different room to other people you live with.•If that isn't possible stay two metres or three steps away from other people.•Sleep alone if possible.•Do not have visitors.•Use your own toothbrushes, eating and drinking utensils, dishes, drinks, towels, washcloths or bedlinen.•Use the kitchen at different times to others in the house and eat alone.•Use a dishwasher if you have one.•If you are breastfeeding, consider asking someone else to feed the baby using expressed milk in a bottle.•Bag personal waste like used tissues inside two bags and keep it away from other household waste for 72 hours before adding to refuse.•Do not shake dirty laundry; this minimises the possibility of dispersing virus through the air.•If you don't have a washing machine wait until after you isolation before going to a launderette.•Keep hydrated by drinking water.•Clean your hands frequently with soap and water for at least 20 seconds.'I think that's the right thing to do for the economy, we need to help businesses have a bridge to get to the other side.'His package came as the Bank of England's base rate was slashed to an historic low of just 0.25 per cent.Mr Johnson will confirm today that the UK is switching from a strategy of trying to contain the outbreak to one of trying to delay its worst effects in order to give the NHS more time to cope. The Prime Minister - one of whose Cabinet ministers went into self-isolation last night along with five other MPs - is also likely to announce a range of social-distancing measures.However, the government is not expected to go as far as Donald Trump, who yesterday told Americans he was ordering an immediate shut-down of all travel from Europe. Irish PM Leo Varadkar has declared that schools, colleges and childcare facilities are to close for two weeks.He made a live statement to the nation from Washington DC, where he is due to meet Mr Trump later as part of the annual St Patrick's Day programme of events. 'Unfortunately we must face the tragic reality that some people will die,' he said.Mr Varadkar said he was acting on fresh advice from the country's National Public Health Emergency Team.'The virus is all over the world, it will continue to spread but it can be slowed,' he said. Dr David Halpern, head of the UK's Behavioural Insights Team dubbed Britain's 'Nudge Unit' who reports directly to Mr Johnson, has suggested the 500,000 people in UK care homes or with respiratory conditions could be the only people protected.He has suggested the virus can be beaten by letting it spread through healthy people to kill it off rather than a nationwide lockdown that could allow coronavirus to rise again later in the year.Dr Halpern has revealed ministers are considering a policy of keeping high-risk groups such as the elderly or those with underlying health conditions isolated in care homes or in their own homes over the coming months.He said: 'There's going to be a point, assuming the epidemic flows and grows as it will do, where you want to cocoon, to protect those at-risk groups so they don't catch the disease.'By the time they come out of their cocooning, herd immunity has been achieved in the rest of the population'.                      FTSE tumbles again on fears of economic chaos                     The London Stock Exchange's leading index of companies today plummeted as much as 10.9 per cent, wiping almost £160 billion off the value of its constituents.Early in the day investors reacted to the World Health Organisation's upgrade of the Covid-19 outbreak to a global pandemic.However the index fell further still in the afternoon, hitting an eight-year low after markets opened down in the US and the European Central Bank unveiled a coronavirus stimulus package, but kept interest rates steady.Within moments of the FTSE 100 opening, it sank more than 300 points, to levels not seen for eight years. More than £520 billion has been wiped since February 21 - a fall of 28%.It means the index is technically in a 'bear market' where the value of shares has fallen by more than 20%.Deputy chief medical officer Jenny Harries was asked on the BBC if 'pretty much everyone will get it eventually'.'The thing about a new virus is, of course, nobody has antibodies ready-made to it. This virus is having a field day, the desire will be to infect as many people as it can,' she said.Dr Harries said it was possible that 'up to 80 per cent of the population' could contract the virus, but added that it was a 'very high estimate'.Scottish First minister Nicola Sturgeon said it was not possible to make the virus 'go away'.'This is a serious situation. We cannot make this virus go away. It is highly likely now that significant numbers of us are going to get this virus,' she said.'The vast majority will have very mild illness and the clear focus right now is on doing everything we can to protect those who are more susceptible to serious illness, but we cannot make this go away, we need to focus on how we manage this outbreak, delay the spread and reduce the numbers infected at any one time.'Scottish Secretary Alister Jack told BBC Radio Scotland's Good Morning Scotland programme there is 'no doubt we are not going to be able to contain it for very much longer' and that efforts will now focus on delaying the spread of the virus to 'put less pressure on the NHS'. Speaking hours after world health officials declared the coronavirus a pandemic, Trump repeatedly defended his own actions and vowed the nation would prevail in countering the virus and getting treatment on the market.'We will be suspending all travel from Europe to the United States for the next 30 days,' Trump announced, in a speech from the Oval Office to the nation. 'The new rules will go into effect Friday at midnight,' he said. The move was so sudden the acting Homeland Security secretary said he would issue full guidance on how to carry it out within 48 hours.                     WHAT IS HERD IMMUNITY?                    Herd immunity is a situation in which a population of people is protected from a disease because so many of them are unaffected by it that it cannot spread. To cause an outbreak a disease-causing bacteria or virus must have a continuous supply of potential victims who are not immune to it.Immunity is when your body knows exactly how to fight off a certain type of infection because it has encountered it before, either by having the illness in the past or through a vaccine.When a virus or bacteria enters the body the immune system creates substances called antibodies, which are designed to destroy one specific type of bug.When these have been created once, some of them remain in the body and the body also remembers how to make them again. This provides long-term protection, or immunity, against an illness.If nobody is immune to an illness - as was the case at the beginning of the coronavirus outbreak - it can spread like wildfire.However, if, for example, half of people have developed immunity - from a past infection or a vaccine - there are only half as many people the illness can spread to.As more and more people become immune the bug finds it harder and harder to spread until its pool of victims becomes so small it can no longer spread at all.The threshold for herd immunity is different for various illnesses, depending on how contagious they are - for measles, around 95 per cent of people must be vaccinated to it spreading.For polio, which is less contagious, the threshold is about 80-85 per cent, according to the Oxford Vaccine Group.The White House said the travel restrictions would apply to foreign nationals who have visited 26 European countries - but excluding the UK and Ireland - in the past 14 days. It will not apply to US citizens, their 'immediate' family members or legal permanent residents. But confusion remained over how exactly the rules would apply and in what time zone the deadline would be introduced. Chancellor Rishi Sunak today said the UK was not following the US example.'The advice we are getting is that there is not evidence that interventions like closing borders or travel bans are going to have a material effect on the spread of the infections,' he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. 'That is why we have taken the decisions that we have.' A video posted on the No10 Twitter feed yesterday shows Mr Johnson chatting with Deputy Chief Medical Officer Jenny Harries.Mr Johnson said: 'It's noticeable that there are some countries where they have banned big sporting events and stopped mass gatherings of one kind or another. Tell us why so far the medical advice in this country is not to do that?'Dr Harries replied that 'expert modellers' had looked at what would happen with the virus. 'In general those sorts of events and big gatherings are not seen as something that is going to have a big effect. So we don't want to disrupt people's lives,' she said.The FTSE index of Britain's leading companies fell 365 points or 6.22 per cent to 5,511 shortly after opening today - its lowest level since February 2016.The falls were in reaction to Mr Trump's intervention, and came despite the Bank of England slashing interest rates from 0.75 per cent to 0.25 per cent and the Budget plan.                      Norway goes into lock-down over coronavirus despite no deaths so far                    Norway's government announced its most complete peacetime shutdown today in a bid to keep coronavirus at bay.Prime Minister Erna Solberg 'the strongest and most intrusive measures' seen outside of war would take effect from this evening.The strict measures included closing schools and universities and banning sporting events.Health workers have been banned from going abroad and all other citizens have been advised not to. 'The measures will have a significant effect on our individual freedoms,' Ms Solberg said. Norway has so far had 621 confirmed cases of COVID-19, with no deaths. Cultural events will be cancelled and Norwegians were asked to avoid public transport and work from home.Bars, public swimming pools, gyms, hairdressers, massage and tattoo parlours, among others will be closed.Restaurants need to ensure that guests are able to keep a minimum distance of one metre from each other and can no longer serve buffets.In addition, the government said all people returning from trips outside the Nordic region must be quarantined for two weeks.Most of the measures introduced will remain in place until March 26 to start with, health minister Bent Hoie said.Speaking before Mr Trump's speech last night, Mr Johnson said: 'There's obviously people under a lot pf pressure - politicians government around the world under a lot of pressure to be seen to act. So they may do things that are not necessarily dictated by the science.'Dr Harries said: 'I am absolutely delighted that we are following the science and the evidence.' She added: 'We have got very clear advice about when we should intervene and that is exactly what I think we should do.' Mr Sunak admitted yesterday that the epidemic was now likely to cause 'temporary disruption to the economy', with millions of workers having to take time off sick, firms struggling with supply problems and shops and restaurants hit by a dramatic fall in trade.'The combination of those effects will have a significant impact on the UK economy,' he said. 'But it will be temporary. People will return to work.'Supply chains will return to normal. Life will return to normal. For a period, it's going to be tough. But I'm confident that our economic performance will recover.'The emergency package, which was only finalised in the early hours of yesterday, overshadowed a series of massive spending decisions that set the Government's economic course for the next four years.Mr Sunak pledged to increase total spending by 22 per cent by 2024, taking the size of the state to more than £1trillion for the first time. Much of the spending will be fuelled by borrowing, with the national debt now on track to top £2trillion by the time of the next election.There will be a rise in the threshold for paying national insurance that delivers an immediate £100 tax cut for 31million workers. The OBR yesterday warned that the coronavirus could lead to a prolonged slowdown, adding: 'Recession this year is quite possible if the spread of coronavirus causes widespread economic disruption.' Mr Sunak said he was ready to make further interventions to ensure that good businesses were not driven to the wall.He said yesterday's £30billion package comprised £12billion of direct spending and £18billion of broader stimulus to the economy.'While the world may slow down, we will act here with a response that is brave and bold, taking decisions now for our future prosperity,' the Chancellor added. 'We are investing in world class infrastructure, and to lead the world in the industries and technologies of the future.'Mr Sunak said the 'central decision' was to increase spending over existing plans by £175billion.The overall tax burden will not rise, mainly because of a decision to abandon a cut in corporation tax. The Treasury admitted the spending might not meet earlier fiscal rules.Some senior Tories voiced reservations. Theresa May said the Conservatives must never fall into Labour's trap of believing that all problems could be fixed by unconstrained spending.The former prime minister added: 'While spending a lot of money may be popular and may seem the natural thing to do, there is of course that necessity of having a realistic assessment of the longer-term impact.'[There is] a necessity to ensure that we have that restraint and caution that enables us to make sure the public finances continue to be strong into the future.'",Web Publication

From navigating the self-checkout to whether to cancel your Tinder date, Samuel Fishwick asks the experts how to adapt your behaviour","March 12, 2020 Thursday",International,The Evening Standard (London),1551,1551,England & Wales,,"Your Covid-19 queries crackedSocial distancing is now the norm - but how far is too far? From navigating the self-checkout to whether to cancel your Tinder date, Samuel Fishwick asks the experts how to adapt your behaviour","THE way the city interacts is changing rapidly. There are 460 confirmed cases of the virus in Britain, eight people have died, and the World Health Organization (WHO) has now officially declared Covid-19 a pandemic, meaning it has spread to more than 100 countries (Public Health England's Covid-19 tracker provides a helpful map of the disease's spread in the UK). We are prepped to enter a ""delay"" phase to slow transmission of the virus to avoid overloading the NHS, and are told we are feasibly two weeks behind Italy. But how does it affect everyday life in the capital? We asked the experts.Is washing my hands going to slow down the spread of the coronavirus? Yes. Hot water, soap and - crucially - comprehensively scrubbing for 20 seconds is enough to kill the virus pathogen. Even if you've touched an infected surface at some point in the past few hours, soap and water is sufficient to eradicate it (just don't touch your mouth or face). It's one of many gentle ""nudges"" to influence public behaviour that an independent contractor, the Behavioural Insights Team, advise the UK government on.Do I have to sing Happy Birthday while I wash my hands? If you don't fancy serenading your own fake birthday, website Wash Your Lyrics matches up an equivalent 20-second length of lyrics from pop songs. ""But [singing Happy Birthday] is a good mnemonic"", says David Comerford, a professor of behavioural economics at the University of Stirling. ""It's a catchy way for people to learn the right thing to do. People are more responsive to new social norms when they're convinced everyone else is practising them too.""But I touch my face and mouth all the time We all do. A 2015 study found that on average medical students touched their face 23 times per hour while awake. Mucous membranes, however, are the most expedient pathway into the body for a virus - so it's a habit that must be broken. Try using a tissue if you need to scratch your nose or rub your eyes . One study has found women touched their faces far less when they wore cosmetics. Try keeping your hands below waist level at all times - or attempt ""urge surfing"", says Dr Elena Touroni, a consultant psychologist at The Chelsea Psychology Clinic - essentially, resist the itch. ""Most urges 'peak' at some point, but if we haven't acted after a couple of minutes, the urge will subside,"" she says.Should I apply hand gel before or after I touch a door knob? Frankly, it doesn't matter - wash your hands before you can touch your face or mouth instead. Outside clinical settings, virucidal gel is less effective than soap and water. ""Indeed, low-quality hand gels can simply 'bake in' whatever's on the surface of your hands as you're not washing it off,"" says Jim McManus, who is Director of Public Health for Hertfordshire.I'm scared to touch doorbells and switches. They're panic buttons Use your knuckles, says McManus - you're less likely to put these in your mouth (unless you're decidedly odd). ""We have to get in the psychological mindset to practise key behaviours to limit the spread of this virus,"" he says.Is there a precise measure for social distancing? The WHO currently advises that you should maintain at least one metre - approximately the length of your arm - between yourself and anyone coughing and sneezing. Although in Italy, where the public have been instructed to stay indoors to combat their current outbreak, this has been revised up to two metres even in a well-ventilated space.What about a cautious, yet friendly, way to say hello? The handshake is out. Touching elbows has been mooted by Public Health Engthrough land, and there is of course the so-called ""Wuhan Shake"" - touching shod feet with another. ""I'm going contactless,"" says Myka Meier, an etiquette expert, who has made a series of public-service announcement videos to answer the public's social concerns. She offers the ""Stop, Drop and Nod"" (keeping your hands behind your back) and the ""Grasp and Greet"" (which involves keeping your hands clasped together in front of you).Do I need to clean my phone? Viruses live longer on non-porous surfaces such as metals and plastics - so phones and keyboards are danger zones. Yet, cleaning your smartphone with an abrasive cleaner will damage its screen coating. Apple advises using a 70 per cent isopropyl alcohol wipe, or Clorox disinfecting wipes, to gently wipe keyboards, phones and other hard services.Should I be wearing a protective facemask? If you test positive for coronavirus, these are a good way to prevent spreading it yourself, but that's about it. Dr Jake Dunning, head of emerging infections and zoonoses (infections transmitted to humans from lower vertebrates) at Public Health England, says ""there is very little evidence of widespread benefit from their use outside clinical settings."" They must be worn correctly, changed frequently, disposed of safely and used in combination with good hygiene behaviour in order for them to be effective. Research also shows ""compliance with these recommended behaviours"" - the good hygiene - ""reduces over time when wearing facemasks for prolonged periods"".Do I need to worry about my lunchtime BLT sandwich? ""Food is only likely to be a risk if it has come into contact with an infected human"", says Martin Hibberd, Professor of Emerging Infectious Disease at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine. ""Food hygienically prepared would be safe.""What about ordering a coffee? Pret has introduced a policy of half-hour sanitising of ""high-touch"" surfaces in front of house areas, in addition to the existing half hour of sanitising for all food contact surfaces and Starbucks is pausing the use of personal cups. But all systems can fail. ""Companies food delivery services should be capable of meeting the challenge, but they should be perfect anyway, and that's not always the case"", says Tim Lang, Professor of Food Policy at City University. ""If you're really worried, make our own lunch"".Contactless or bank notes? People should avoid using banknotes to prevent transmissions of the virus, the WHO has said, and switch to contactless if possible.Need I fear the train and the bus? Using public transport definitely increases likelihood of coming into contact with lots of people, thereby increasing chances of transmissibility. TFL has introduced an enhanced cleaning regime across the London network, with daily disenfections. Certainly, those sneezing or coughing should be avoided says Hibberd, and you should wash your hands after touching surfaces before touching your face. But ""where extensive contact tracing has been carried out, it seems that most casual encounters (such as on a bus) have not resulted in transmissions"", he says. ""Mostly transmission seems to be associating with sharing a home or prolonged close contact.""What about walking or cycling? Walking and cycling get you moving, as we know. ""This helps move our lymphatic fluid around the body"", says Dr Jenna Macciochi, an immunologist at the University of Sussex. ""Think of this like our immune cells superhighways, enabling our immune cells to perform better surveillance"", she adds. ""And while you are out walking and cycling, you are less likely to come into close contact with infected people.""How can I supercharge my immune system? Have more sex. Obviously, not with someone who is coughing and spluttering. But there's a link between how often you have sex and how strong your immune system is, researchers say. A study in Pennsylvania found students who had sex once or twice a week had higher levels of an illness-fighting substance in their bodies (Immunoglobulin A (IgA) was 30 per cent higher).So, I should do more dating? Up to you. On the one hand, Tinder is encouraging its users to prioritise their health over forming new connections and ""having fun"" amid fears about coronavirus. ""It's less of the handshaking, touching and kissing,"" says John Oxford, Emeritus Professor of virology at Queen Mary University London, who believes the virus's weakness lies in reducing ""transmission events"" where it can be spread by contact. Or you can keep calm and carry on. Last week, Hinge tweeted that singles should wash their hands before stealing a date's fries.Do I need to worry about fruit and veg at the supermarket? ""The surface of fruit and vegetables would be no different from any other surface with regards to survival of the virus and so the same precautions should be taken"", says Preofessor Neil Boonham, Chair of Applied Crop Science at Newcastle University. Washing hands and washing produce would be prudent regardless of whether you're buying produce packaged or loose.""Self-service or checkout? Using a machine in theory reduces the likelihood of person-to-person transmission. But it depends on whether you're confident that the machine is being cleaned. It's a surface, after all.Should I avoid the gym? Work out outside where possible. Virgin Active, for instance, is asking all Group Exercise instructors to avoid contact during classes which includes correcting form with physical touch and high-fiving. But also - do what makes you happy.

But the strict protocol will raise concerns that infected patients are going undetected, left to spread the disease.One retired intensive care doctor said he had friends who were repeatedly refused tests earlier this month after developing severe flu-like symptoms following a ski trip.The group had been to the Ischgl resort in Austria, which is not currently on NHS 111's list of high-risk countries - although some nations consider it a risk area.The 55 year-year-old, who gave his name only as Andrew, told the Guardian: These people are saying they are as ill as they've ever been, and they still can't do a test.' He added that he had also never been so ill' and had hoped to be tested. The NHS yesterday announced it would start to test 10,000 people a day - up from 1,500. But patients are only offered a test if they have been to high risk' countries including China, Iran, South Korea or Italy, or have knowingly come into contact with an infected individual.Sam Freedman, chief executive of the international, non-profit Education Partnerships Group, said the system had a major flaw.'He added on Twitter: Unfortunately I have a cough and a fever. Turns out I can't get a test because I haven't been to any affected countries or come into contact with a known case. Even though I have been through an airport and to a concert.'Another patient, Sam Butler, tweeted: I've got the worst flu I've ever had (despite flu jab)... It fits the description of COVID exactly, but NHS 111 says it isn't, because I haven't been abroad.'A spokesman for Public Health England said they are testing people with symptoms who are most likely' to be infected.   PLAN TO COCOON' CARE HOMESTHE ELDERLY and care home residents will be cocooned' from the outside world to protect them from coronavirus.Ministers are considering a policy of keeping high-risk groups apart from the wider population until herd immunity' has been established.Dr David Halpern, chief executive of the Government-owned Behavioural Insights team, also suggested that volunteers would be recruited to help out in care homes. There's going to be a point, assuming the epidemic flows and grows as it will do, where you want to cocoon, to protect those at-risk groups so they don't catch the disease,' he said.By the time they come out of their cocooning, herd immunity has been achieved in the rest of the population.'Herd immunity is when the majority of the population have caught a disease and subsequently become immune, meaning the contagion is unable to spread as easily. © Daily Mail",Papers

Boris Johnson was joined by Prof Chris Whitty, the government's chief medical adviser, and Sir Patrick Vallance, the government's chief scientific adviser. •Johnson said that Britain was facing the ""worst public health crisis for a generation"" and that ""many more"" people would die. (See 5.52pm.) In a marked change of tone from his previous press conferences and interviews on this subject, he explained that Britons were going to face considerable disruption to ordinary life over the next few months as the government introduced measures to delay and limit the spread of Covid-19.•Johnson said the true number of coronavirus cases in the population was probably ""much higher"" than official figures suggest. He said:The number of cases will rise sharply, indeed the true number of cases is higher - perhaps much higher - than the number of cases we have so far confirmed with tests.Vallance said he thought the actual number of people infected in the UK at the moment could be between 5,000 and 10,000. The official number of confirmed cases is 596. •Johnson confirmed that the UK was now moving out of the ""contain"" phase and into the ""delay"" phase for dealing with the epidemic. He said:This is now not just to attempt to contain the disease as far as possible, but to delay its spread and thereby minimise the suffering. If we delay the peak even by a few weeks, then our NHS will be in a stronger state as the weather improves and fewer people suffer from normal respiratory diseases, more beds are available and we'll have more time for medical research. We can also act to stretch the peak of the disease over a longer period so that our society is better able to cope.•Johnson said that people with a fever or a new, persistent cough were now being asked to stay at home for seven days. He also said schools were being advised to cancel overseas trips, and the over-70s and the ill were being told to avoid cruises. He said:From tomorrow, if you have coronavirus symptoms, however mild -- either a new continuous cough or a high temperature -- then you should stay at home for at least 7 days to protect others and help slow the spread of the disease. We advise all those over 70 and those with serious medical conditions against going on cruises and we advise against international school trips. •He said that at some point in the future the government would go further, and ask all family members to stay at home if someone was ill. He said:At some point in the next few weeks we are likely to go further and if someone in a household has those symptoms then we will be asking everyone in that household will stay at home.He also said that at some point in the future the elderly would be asked to stay away from places or people to avoid infection. He did not give details.•He said at the moment he was not planning to ban sporting events, but he said this was being kept under review. He said:We are considering the question of banning major public events such as sporting fixtures. And the scientific advice, as we've said over the last couple of weeks, is that banning such events will have little effect on the spread but there's also the issue of the burden that such events can place on public services.In a mild dig at Nicola Sturgeon, the Scottish first minister who is planning to cancel events with crowds of more than 500 people from next week and whose decision to announce the results of the Cobra meeting before Johnson angered some in No 10, Johnson said that Scotland might have a particular issue with the resilience of its emergency services. He implied that that was why the Scots needed a different policy. Vallance said cancelling sporting events could be counterproductive. He explained:On average, one person infects two or three others.You therefore have a very low probability of infecting a large number of people in a stadium and a rather higher probability of infecting people very close to you.And that means that most of the transmission actually tends to take place with friends and colleagues and those in close environments - and not in the big environments.Though it is true that any cancellation of things can have some effect, if you then get a displacement activity where you end up with everyone congregating somewhere else, you may actually perversely have an increased risk, particularly in an indoor environment.So it doesn't mean you shouldn't at some point make the decision from a resilience point but this is not a major way to tackle this epidemic.•Johnson defended his decision not to introduce measures as draconian as those being introduced in some other other countries. He said:The measures that I have discussed today... staying at home if you think you have the symptoms, your whole household staying at home, looking after the elderly - making sure the elderly and vulnerable stay at home - these are the three most powerful defensive lines.We think it's very important to maintain public trust and confidence in what we are doing, throughout this challenging time, always to be guided by the best possible scientific advice.He and his advisers also argued that, if self-isolation measures were introduced too early, they would be ineffective - because people would ignore them at the point where they were most necessary.•Whitty said he thought the overall mortality rate from Covid-19 was around 1% or less. It was higher for older people, and people in the vulnerable group, and lower for others, he said. But he said he did not want to speculate on who many people might die from the illness because he said the scientists just did not know how many people are infected. He said, although an 80% infection rate was the government's top reasonable worst case scenario, nowhere in the world was currently coming close to an infection level like that.•Vallance said that the outbreak in the UK could be about four weeks behind the outbreak in Italy.•Vallance said the peak of the epidemic in the UK was ""something like 10 to 14 weeks away"".That's all from me for today.Thanks for the comments.block-time published-time 6.21pm GMT The Nigel Farage critique of Boris Johnson (see 6.08pm) is still very much a minority view at Westminster. That could change very quickly, of course, and it was noticeable that the questions posed by the media at the press conference this afternoon were a bit more hostile than            at the press conference on Monday, or            the one he did on Tuesday last week. But the opposition parties have been broadly supportive of the government's approach, and            some YouGov polling last week (pdf) said more people thought Johnson was handling this well (49%) than badly (32%).

In a marked change of tone from the previous press conferences and interviews he has given on this subject, he said that this was the worst public health crisis for a generation and that ""many more"" people would die. He said:It's clear that coronavirus Covid-19 continues and will continue to spread across the world and our country over the next few months.We've done what can be done to contain this disease, and this has bought us valuable time, but it's now a global pandemic.The number of cases will rise sharply, indeed the true number of cases is higher - perhaps much higher - than the number of cases we have so far confirmed with tests.We've all got to be clear, this is the worst public health crisis for a generation.Some people compare it to seasonal flu, alas that is not right.Due to the lack of immunity this disease is more dangerous.It is going to spread further and I must level with you, I must level with the British public: many more families are going to lose loved ones before their time.Full summary coming soon.    Boris Johnson at his press conference. Photograph: Simon Dawson/AFP via Getty Images      block-time published-time 5.43pm GMT Johnson is winding up now.He ends by repeating the point about how if anyone has a high temperature, or a new and continuous cough, they should stay at home.That is the way to ""squash the sombrero"", he says, referring to the graph illustrating the peak (see below).And that's it. I will post a summary and reaction shortly.    Sir Patrick Vallance with a graph showing the shape of an epidemic Photograph: Sky News      block-time published-time 5.39pm GMT Q: How confident are we in the data?Johnson says some countries are having some success in greatly reducing the incidence of the disease.He says there are measures that could be taken of a draconian nature. But that might just lead to the disease surging back, he says.Whitty says there are some things we are very confident of, like the mortality rate.But we don't know how many people get the disease without symptoms.He says, depending on what the answer to that is, the disease has very different outcomes.block-time published-time 5.37pm GMT Q: When do you think older people will be asked to stay at home? And how old is old?Vallance says the peak is probably 10 to 14 weeks away, maybe longer. Even to cover the peak, you would need to ensure that those sorts of measures would be in place for 12 or 13 weeks or so.Whitty say people may get individual advice from their GP. But national guidance will also be issued at the appropriate time, he says.block-time published-time 5.35pm GMT Q: What do you mean by people volunteering?Johnson says he hopes people will think of their neighbours, and consider what they can do to help them. The advice is not to go within two metres of them.Vallance says the behavioural science says, at times like this, you see an outbreak of altruism.Q: You said we were four week behind Italy. Might we have to introduce Italian-style measures?Vallance says the UK may be four weeks behind in terms of the scale of the outbreak. You would expect it to follow a similar trajectory in terms of numbers.. What they are proposing today are measures to deflect that, he says.block-time published-time 5.33pm GMT Q: Are you planning any register to help people volunteer?Johnson says Matt Hancock is setting up a system for people who want to come back to the NHS to offer their services.block-time published-time 5.32pm GMT Q: Some workers will not be covered by our statutory sick pay issue. Could you extend SSP?Johnson says the government is changing benefits rules. It will do everything necessary to ensure people are not penalised for doing the right thing.Q: Are you worried about getting it yourself? You have to meet a lot of people in your job. And who would step in if you were incapacitated?Johnson just says he is washing his hands.block-time published-time 5.30pm GMT Johnson asks Vallance to address the point about whether stopping flights is effective.Vallance says, when they looked at this in reduction to China, they thought at best stopping flights would delay the disease by a day or two.And he says screening at airports sound sensible. But in the US the first case went through screening.On sports events, he says a single individual on average infects two or three others.That means there is a very low probability of infecting a large number of people in a studium.Most infection takes places when people are with friends, not when they are in large groups.That means, perversely, banning large events could be counter-productive.He says the way to fight this is to reduce infection across households and across people who are affected.block-time published-time 5.27pm GMT Q: Can you understand why people watching this will think you are doing little, when they look at the kind of things happening in Ireland?Johnson says he is guided by the best scientific advice.Q: The German chancellor said 70% of people could get this. Do you agree? And how many people might die?Vallance says getting people to stay at home will give you a 20 to 25% reduction in the peak.And he says isolating the elderly can reduce the death rate by about 30%, he says.He says it is important not to go to things that sound sensible, but have little effect.And you don't want to introduce measures that only apply for a week or two, he says. To be effective, these measure will have to last longer.Whitty says closing schools has big knock-on effects for the whole of society.On numbers, Whitty says he has been absolute level with the public on numbers on which he has confidence.He says his top planning assumption is 80% of people getting the illness.He says he and Vallance agree on a mortality rate of 1% - which would be higher for vulnerable groups, and lower for other groups.But he says what he does not want to do is give a figure for how many people have been affected. He says he does not want to do that because he does not know the numbers.block-time published-time 5.21pm GMT Whitty says asking people to stay at home with minor symptoms sounds easy.But in practice it will be harder for people than they think.block-time published-time 5.20pm GMT Johnson is now taking questions.Q: How sure are you that your approach is right?Johnson says he is guided by science in everything he does.He returns to the point about elderly people. He says you need to time the period of isolation for them at the point where they are most at risk.He says in Scotland there is a particular issue with the resilience of public services. In the UK this issue will have to be kept under review too, he says.He says the UK government is not saying no to the sort of measure announced by Nicola Sturgeon. (See 12.57pm.)block-time published-time 5.17pm GMT Whitty says the government is also looking at mitigation measures.First, that involves reducing the peak.And, second, that involves increasing the capacity of the NHS.block-time published-time 5.16pm GMT Whitty says, at the next stage, the government will want to introduce social distancing measures for people who are vulnerable or who have underlying conditions.But it is too early to recommend that, he says.He says this would lead to other problems, like loneliness.But at some point it will be necessary to do this, he says.block-time published-time 5.15pm GMT And Whitty says there will now no longer by any geographical limits to testing.block-time published-time 5.15pm GMT Whitty says there are other changes too.The government no longer needs to identify every case, he says. People staying at home will not need testing. Testing will focus on people in hospitals with symptoms.block-time published-time 5.14pm GMT Whitty says it is important that people with mild symptoms do not call 111.But if their conditions deteriorate, they should seek medical help.block-time published-time 5.13pm GMT  Prof Chris Whitty,  the government's chief medical adviser, is speaking now.He says the contain phase is over, and the government is moving on to the delay phase.All four chief medical officers have agreed to raise the risk level to high.He says it is important not to ask people too early to respond. There is a danger of fatigue.Washing hands is very important, he says.He says, from today, the government is asking people who have a persistent cough which is new, or a temperature, to stay at home for seven days.It is important to explain why, he says.First, he says this reduces the risk to older people and people with underlying conditions.Second, he says this can reduce the peak.And, third, this can delay the peak, he says.He says they have chosen seven days because the illness is most infectious at the beginning.He says the evidence suggests that people with mild symptoms can spread the disease to a lot of people.block-time published-time 5.09pm GMT Vallance says the timing is critical: if you tell people to stay at home too early, they get fed up with this at the point where you need them to stay at home.On closing schools, he says for this to be effective, closures would have to last from 13 to 16 weeks. He says children would, in practice, keep mixing with each other during that period. And they might get sent to stay with grandparents, which could increase the risk, he says.block-time published-time 5.08pm GMT  Sir Patrick Vallance, the government's chief scientific adviser, is speaking now.This is a new disease, he says. He says no one has immunity to it.He says it looks as if the UK is on a trajectory about four weeks behind Italy.He shows a slide showing a peak. This shows the pattern of an infection, he says.He says it starts with very low numbers. He says the number of infections at the moment is likely to be between 5,000 and 10,000.Then the number of infections rise steeply, he says.He says the government wants to do two things: to delay the peak, and to push the peak down.He says delaying the peak pushes it into the summer, when respiratory diseases are less common.He says it is not possible to stop everyone getting it. And it is not desirable either, he says. He says you want people to pick up immunity.He says the disease seems to come in two phases: an early, mildish phase, and then a second phase, where the elderly and people with underlying conditions are vulnerable.block-time published-time 5.04pm GMT Johnson says he wants to address older people in particular. For most people this is a mild illness, but he knows they are vulnerable.He says he wants to tell them that the government will do all it can ""to help you and your family"".The government is not just helping the economy, he says. He says he wants to stress that it is helping families.He says he wants to end with two familiar messages.First, it is vital to wash your hands.And, second, the country will get through this, just as it has got through other situations like this.block-time published-time 5.02pm GMT Johnson says this will cause disruption across the country for many months.He says he wants to urge people not to call 111, but to use the internet to get information if they can.block-time published-time 5.01pm GMT Johnson says he is not closing schools now.He says the advice is that his could do more harm than good.But the situation may change, he says.block-time published-time 5.00pm GMT Johnson says the government is considering banning large events.He says that won't necessarily reduce the spread. But that would ease the pressure on the emergency services, he says.block-time published-time 5.00pm GMT Johnson says tomorrow, if you have coronavirus symptoms, you should stay home for at least seven days.He says people over 70 with underlying medical conditions are being advised to avoid going on cruises. And he says schools are being advised to cancel overseas trips.block-time published-time 4.58pm GMT  Boris Johnson says 'many more' people will die from coronavirus   Boris Johnson  is starting his press conference.He says he has just chaired a Cobra meeting.

(See 1.56pm.) These two charts from the            detailed presentation on public services (pdf) explain why in more detail.This chart shows how, in real terms, day-to-day spending on public services will be higher in 2024-25 than it was in 2009-10, at the end of the last Labour government. But there's a catch, or rather two. First, if you look at day-to-day spending on public services per head, it is no higher than it was in 2009-10 (because the population has got bigger). And, second, if you take out health, which received a sizeable, long-term spending increase under Theresa May, real-terms spending on everything else is lower than at the end of the Labour government, both overall (7% lower) and per person (14% lower).    Real-terms public spending figures. Photograph: IFS   But the IFS also says these figures are potentially misleading, for two reasons. First, they include the £11bn a year that the UK will save because it won't have to make annual payments to the EU - but they do not take into account the £7-8bn a year that the EU used to spend in the UK. And, second, they include an extra £5.5bn a year that the government is spending because of changes to the rules on employer pension contributions. The IFS argues that taking out these figures allows for a more reliable comparison with the past, and on that basis it has produced a chart with adjusted figures (see below).On this measure, day-to-day public spending in real terms will still be higher in 2024-25 than in 2009-10, but only 5% higher, not 9% higher. But day-to-day spending per person ends up being 4% lower in 2024-25 in real terms than in 2009-10, overall spending excluding health is 12% lower, and spending per person excluding health is 19% lower.

Ross Greer MSP, a co-chair of the party's executive, said: Due to the ongoing coronavirus situation the Scottish Greens executive committee has today taken the decision to cancel our upcoming conference. The health and wellbeing of our members and the public is our primary concern and it is with that in mind that we have taken this decision.The conference was due to be held at the Adam Smith theatre in Kirkcaldy, the birth place of the legendary 18th century economist. block-time updated-timeUpdated at 3.09pm GMTblock-time published-time 2.51pm GMT  Johnny Mercer, the veterans minister, promised to unveil a bill on Wednesday next week to introduce a statutory presumption against prosecution for veterans in the Commons, as he made a statement about mental health in the armed forces in the morning. The minister said he was meeting a pledges to legislate in this area, but would not say how or whether the measures would apply to Northern Ireland, where many violent incidents from the time of the Troubles are only now beginning to be investigated by legal authorities. ""The days of lawyers running amok in our services and in our veterans community, trying to rewrite history, in order to make money, are over,"" Mercer added.The party's election manifesto promised to ""introduce new legislation to tackle the vexatious legal claims that undermine our armed forces"".In the last parliament Penny Mordaunt, the then defence secretary, proposed a statutory presumption against prosecutions against veterans for incidents taking place 10 or more years ago, covering Iraq, Afghanistan and any other armed conflict overseas - but left open the question of Northern Ireland, prompting pressure from Conservative backbenchers for it to be included.Mercer was challenged by newly elected Alliance party MP Stephen Farry, who voiced concern about the impending legislation. He said:I do challenge this narrative of excessive claims being made against veterans, particularly in relation to Northern Ireland. It undermines the criminal justice system in Northern Ireland, which has the ability to weed out such claims.Farry warned that some vet...",Newspaper

Mass isolation, crisis plans and months of diseaseThe Prime Minister warned that ""many families are going to lose loved ones"" as he introduced new measures to try and protect the elderly and vulnerable. The new advice means anyone with symptoms,such as a continuous cough or high temperature, must now stay at home for seven days","Boris Johnson has said Covid-19 ""is the worst public health crisis for a generation"" -as he introduced a range of measures to tackle the spread of the virus.The Prime Minister introduced new measures to try and protect the elderly and vulnerable, saying anyone with coronavirus symptoms, however mild, such as a continuous cough or high temperature, must now stay at home for seven days.The advice also applies to children, meaning parents could need to take time off to look after their youngsters at home.The PM said school trips abroad should be stopped, while people over 70 with serious medical conditions should not go on cruises.Mr Johnson told reporters at a press conference in Downing Street that there was no need to close schools now as the scientific advice ""is that this could do more harm than good"".He said this may change at some point while in the future, if somebody is taken ill, their entire household could be told to self-isolate.Mr Johnson said families would continue to ""lose loved ones before their time"" as the coronavirus outbreak worsens.""We've all got to be clear, this is the worst public health crisis for a generation,"" said the PM.""Some people compare it to seasonal flu, alas that is not right.""Due to the lack of immunity this disease is more dangerous.""It is going to spread further and I must level with you, I must level with the British public: many more families are going to lose loved ones before their time.""                     What are the symptoms                   Experts say the symptoms of coronavirus are a high temperature and a new, continuous cough.A high temperature is deemed to one above 37.5C.Chief Scientific Adviser Sir Patrick Vallance said modelling predicted a 20-25% reduction in the peak of the epidemic by getting people to stay at home for a week if they have mild symptoms.Moving to whole household isolation adds an extra 25% reduction -so together those measures roughly half the size of the peak.Preventing the elderly from getting infected could reduce death rates by 20-30%, Sir Patrick added.                     Will there be more announcements                   Chief Medical Officer Professor Chris Whitty spoke of the need of isolating older and more vulnerable people -but that would not happen yet because it could have other negative consequences like increasing loneliness.But the tactic may change in the future.The Government could also advise anybody living with somebody who is taken ill to self-isolate for seven days, taking the total to 14 days, though that measure has not yet been introduced.The likelihood is measured will continue to be ramped up as scientists continue to decide how to best to defend citizens from Covid-19, by studying how the disease acts, and by watching and learning from other countries' experiences.                     What actions are the NHS taking                   The NHS is examining how it can prepare to deal with the peak of the virus when it hits.Ultimately this means health service chiefs are looking at cancelling non-essential procedures and some primary care to free up capacity.The ultimate aim is to add to the 5000 ventilated beds nationally -as the most serious cases of coronavirus will require oxygen to treat.FORMER HEALTH SECRETARY JEREMY HUNT SAYS IT IS 'SURPRISING AND CONCERNING' WE ARE NOT DOING MORE TO ENCOURAGE SOCIAL DISTANCING                     How long until the government thinks we will hit the peak                   The government currently believes that the peak of the virus is about 12 to 15 weeks away.At the peak, the NHS could be stretched to capacity.Measures like self-isolation are expected to push down the peak of the infection and delay peak.If they can delay the peak, experts believe the pressure on the NHS will be lessened and we may see some benefit of the warm weather in slowing the spread.                     Why does the government think up to 10,000 people may now be infected                   Modelling is understood to suggest that between 5000 to 10000 people could be infected.This is based on the number of people who have developed Covid-19 through community transmission -ie without a direct link to someone who is known to have the virus.At his press conference, Mr Johnson said: ""The true number of cases is higher, perhaps much higher, than the number of cases we've confirmed with tests.""Families are going to lose a loved one before there time.""Chief Scientific Advisor Sir Patrick Vallance said: ""Currently we're on a trajectory that looks as though it's four weeks or so behind Italy, and some other countries in Europe.""He added: ""There are currently 590 cases that have been identified in the UK and there are more than 20 patients on intensive care units.""If you calculate what that really means, in terms of the total number, it's much more likely that we've got somewhere between 5,000 and 10,000 people infected at the moment.""The same sorts of ratios will be true in other countries depending how much testing they've done.""                     What do I do if I feel ill                   Today's announcement marks a shift in the official advice.While previously people were told only to self-isolate if they have been in contact with an infected person or hotspot area or are told to by NHS 111.But now anyone who has a new and a persistent cough or a temperature -categorised by 37.5C -is asked to stay at home.The Chief Medical Officer advised those with mild symptoms to treat it as they would do a sprain i.e. to stay at home and look after themselves. People are asked to avoid calling 111 unless their symptoms get worse to keep it free.""It helps to protect older or more vulnerable people who they might come directly or indirectly into contact with,"" he said.""It is important that people with very minor symptoms do not call 111.""But if people's symptoms deteriorate then they should use the helpline.Prof Whitty said the virus was its most contagious when symptoms first appear so that by seven days the great majority of people are not infectious.""The evidence would appear to be that some people with even quite mild symptoms can spread this virus to a lot of people,"" he said.""It is no longer necessary for us to identify every case and we will move from having testing mainly done in homes and outpatients and walk-in centres, to a situation where people who are remaining at home do not need testing.""                     Are schools being closed                   No. Unlike in Ireland and a number of other European countries the UK has no plan to close schools.The CMO advised that school closures were useful when a virus particularly hits children but that this form of coronavirus actually seems to affect children less.Meanwhile, closing schools would have a knock-on effect as it would keep parents at home -including some who are needed to staff the NHS and other vital services.But individual schools may be told to close if they have cases of the virus.Mr Johnson said: ""We are not -repeat not -closing schools now. The scientific advice is that this could do more harm than good at this time. But we are of course keeping this under review and this again may change as the disease spreads. Schools should only close if they are specifically advised to do so. And that remains our advice.""All schools have been told to cancel any planned international trips.Education is devolved to the Northern Ireland and Welsh Assembly and Scottish Parliament who could decide to close schools if they want to.Chief Scientific Adviser Patrick Valance said: ""It's true that there's some effect in closing schools but that effect is minimal and you'd have to do it for 13-16 weeks or longer and you don't need to be a very advanced mathematician to work out that the chances of keeping children not speaking to each other or playing with each for 13-16 weeks is zero and therefore you have to be very careful to make sure you take the right measures that will stop this rather than things which might end up with children for example going to stay with grandparents at the time they might be most vulnerable.""                     Are large-scale events like football matches going to be cancelled                   Not as a matter of course in the UK apart from in Scotland where the First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has taken a separate decision to axe any events where more than 500 people are gathering.But that is not because of the spread -large-scale events actually don't make the spread more likely.Instead Ms Sturgeon says she was putting a stop to them to free up the NHS and other emergency workers.                     Mr Johnson said that he wasn't taking a similar decision yet but that could change in the coming weeks and months.He said: ""We are considering the question of banning major public events such as sporting fixtures. The scientific advice as we've said over the last couple of weeks is that banning such events will have little effect on the spread.""But there is also the issue of the burden that such events can place on public services. So we're discussing these issues with colleagues in all parts of the United Kingdom and will have more to say shortly about the timing of further action in that respect.""                     Why do other countries appear to be doing more                   Schools in Italy and Ireland are closed and America banned incoming flights. But according to the British experts drastic measures require the support of the public -and so when they are introduced is important.Prof Whitty said: ""The important part of the science of this is the behavioural science.""People start off with the best of intentions [of following the rules] but if you start too early then people's enthusiasm starts to run out just about the peak.""Which is the time we want people to be doing these interventions, that is not a productive way to do it.""So we do need to it at the last point it is reasonable so that people retain their enthusiasm through what will actually be things which are quite difficult to do.""",Newspaper; Web Publication

85,Why is the government relying on nudge theory to fight coronavirus?;It would be good to know the evidence for the UK strategy - which is starkly different to that of other countries,"March 13, 2020 Friday",International,The Guardian (London),975,975,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,Tony Yates,Why is the government relying on nudge theory to fight coronavirus?It would be good to know the evidence for the UK strategy - which is starkly different to that of other countries,"With an estimated 5,000 to 10,000 coronavirus cases now present in the UK, the government has eschewed social distancing measures such as closing schools and banning large            sporting events. Instead, it has opted for behavioural ""nudges"": wash your hands, don't touch your face, don't shake hands with others, stay at home if you feel ill, and self-isolate if you have a continuous cough.This approach differs starkly from the quarantine measures taken in China, South Korea, Italy and Iran. But it also marks the UK out as different from countries such as Ireland, Norway and Denmark, which have implemented school closures despite seeing only a relatively small number of coronavirus cases. Patrick Vallance, the government's chief scientific adviser, has explained that part of the            reason for not embracing bans is to encourage ""herd immunity"". Allow enough of those who can survive coronavirus disease to get infected, and the virus won't have new people to infect, meaning new cases will dry up. Other European countries seem to have judged this too bold an approach. Immunity will probably be temporary, so later outbreaks are to be expected, and dealt with by heightened            contact tracing when they occur.The UK government's strategy is influenced by nudge theory, an idea first popularised by the behavioural economist Richard Thaler and political scientist Cass Sunstein. ""Nudging"" uses insights about our mental processes to change our behaviour through coaxing and positive assertion. Rather than forcing us to do things, nudging tweaks the environments in which we make choices - for example by requiring people to opt out of organ donation, rather than opting in.Perhaps most importantly of all, nudge thinking has informed what the UK is not doing. As stressed by the government and David Halpern, leader of the behavioural insights team (aka the ""nudge unit"") that is playing a big role in advising the government's response, the reason that it isn't yet time to close schools or ban large gatherings is that ""fatigue"" could set in - meaning people will grow tired of the bans and find ways around them. If the effectiveness of social distancing measures is time-limited, the logic seems to be, better to reserve these measures for when we're closer to the peak of the epidemic.The government's press conference on Thursday featured other more subtle nudges too. Boris Johnson was flanked and followed by his scientific advisers, a visual reinforcement of the message that the government is trusting the science - and knows what it's doing. But the UK's strategy is an outlier. If the nudgers have got it right, why are so many other countries taking a very different view of the ""science""? The predictions about fatigue setting in, on the face of it, seem dubious. We might get tired of bans on large gatherings such as gigs, concerts and sporting events, or school closures, but we can't circumvent them; and nothing we might do has the same capacity for ""super-spreading"" the virus to large numbers at once. And if we are prone to fatigue, why rely on the one thing we can ignore - advice about hand washing?The government's strategy has at its heart predictions about human behaviour. Predictions are based on analysing past episodes of human behaviour, a process that is often fraught with error, to draw inferences about future behaviour, which can be highly uncertain. Which analyses of human behaviour are government scientists relying on? And how comparable are they? Why is fatigue such a problem for new coronavirus measures, which we might expect would command the same kind of support as a war effort, when the state lives with this ""fatigue"" in the design of the laws and norms that permanently regulate our lives?We can't answer these questions, because the government's scientists aren't yet disclosing what studies and past evidence underpin their current approach. The government's tactic - one might even call it a nudge - is to appeal to the credentials of its advisers and behavioural scientists, and to trust the experts.Halpern's behavioural insights team, which was created in 2010 by the coalition government as a company part-owned by the UK Cabinet Office, counts some successes - including encouraging more black and minority ethnic police recruits and coaxing high earners to pay more tax. And there are weightier pieces of evidence in the epidemiology literature to suggest that fatigue is a genuine problem - for example, research shows that media messages about flu have a diminishing effect on human behaviour. But we can't tell what role studies like this are playing in government thinking, and such studies lead us back to the same conundrum: if we are prone to fatigue, why rely on nudges, and why delay less easily disregarded and legalised social distancing?The approaches in the UK and the rest of Europe are starkly different, and both cannot be right. Mistakes by one country are going to spill over into outcomes for another. Nowhere will this be more clear than in Ireland: north of the Irish border, UK schools are open and citizens are being nudged in the fashion of ""keep calm and wash your hands"". South of the border, schools are closed - and nudges aren't considered a sufficient response.The Vote Leave campaign that Johnson led implored us to ignore the economic consensus about the likely effects of Brexit. The government he is leading now is reversing course and imploring us to listen to the experts - in this case, experts on behavioural science. We might be nudged further towards heeding the advice of Johnson and his team were their evidence base for Britain's divergent coronavirus response shared with the public.

Mr Stewart, who led the UK's effort to fight ebola in Africa in 2019, said: 'I think we can be very tough, and clear, [with the British public]. This is the worst pandemic we have had for 100 years.'The Government's approach is essentially defeatist. They are saying we cannot suppress this. They say there is no point in spending a huge amount of money trying to suppress this, instead they are trying to manage the increase. We are taking far too much risk. 'I think that is a dangerous thing to do. I don't think if we allow this to spread it can be managed in that way.'And when you start getting serious numbers of people dying and the terrible choices that have to be made in hospitals, people will think that paying the cost early, now, was the right thing to do'.However, Downing Street hit back and said 'we are very clear where we take our advice from' - pointing to the contributions made by the Chief Medical Officer and the government's Chief Scientific Adviser. Number 10 also said action had been taken on care homes: 'We have set out that if people have concerns about their health or any symptoms they should not be visiting care homes.' But Mr Stewart, who is running to be the next Mayor of London as an independent, added: 'I'm absolutely confident that acting early is the better option. I would be shutting all schools and banning all gatherings immediately.'I think it is too pessimistic and defeatist and we should be taking the approach seen in China and South Korea that have actually reduced the number of cases. It can be done. It requires very tough and extreme measures.'The Government questions whether the public is up for the kind of measures we have seen in other countries. I disagree, I believe the British public will do what others have done'.Debate is raging over whether the Prime Minister has gone far enough to protect the UK's 66million people from the pandemic.The official number of coronavirus cases in the UK yesterday jumped by 134 to 596 with 10 deaths - but the Government's chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance said the true number was probably up to 10,000 cases and growing rapidly. But Mr Johnson has still held off drastic measures enforced across Europe such as banning mass gatherings and closing schools, telling Britons that the most important measure remains to wash hands for 20 seconds - and told people to stay at home for seven days if they have a new persistent cough or a high temperature. A ban on flights to and from Europe - like the one announced by US President Donald Trump - was also dismissed by the Government yesterday. Asked about the decision not to cancel large gatherings yet, with 70,000 at Cheltenham for the Gold Cup today, Jeremy Hunt told the BBC's Newsnight: 'I think it is surprising and concerning that we're not doing any of it at all when we have just four weeks before we get to the stage that Italy is at.'He added: 'The issue is not whether you or I might get infected at a football match, it's who we go on to meet.' English football's leaders have taken matters in to their own hands today as players and managers fell ill, with all professional matches including the Premier League cancelled until April 3 at the earliest. [item name=video id=4183448 style=2 /][item name=video id=4183106 style=2 /][related]Italy - the world's worst-hit country after China - is in complete lockdown as the country's tally of deaths has topped 1,000 with more than 15,000 patients infected by the virus. In response to the growing threat across Europe, Ireland yesterday closed all schools, colleges and nurseries and banned gatherings of more than 500 people. Norway's Prime Minister Erna Solberg last night put the country on a footing never seen in peacetime, despite having recorded no coronavirus deaths yet. Ms Solberg took all the Irish steps as well as banning all health workers from leaving the country, and forcing anyone returning from abroad into quarantine, including the king and queen who have been on a state visit to Jordan. But controversially the British Government appears to be pursuing a policy of 'herd immunity' - where the majority of the healthy population will get and fight off the virus so that the disease cannot be spread easily any more. The elderly and ill will be 'cocooned' from the outside world to protect them for weeks or even months. Critics have warned the policy is high risk because there have been multiple reports in China of people getting it twice - and concerns from experts that coronavirus could mutate and infect hundreds of thousands again in the coming years unless there is a vaccine.In other developments today to the escalating global crisis, which has seen more than 131,000 patients across the world get infected: •A Chinese spokesman accused the US military of bringing the coronavirus to Wuhan - the Chinese city where the COVID-19 outbreak began at the end of December;•A 37-year-old US woman who beat the infection claimed she didn't suffer the tell-tale symptom of a cough and instead only had a headache and tingling arms and legs;•French President Emmanuel Macron declared the pandemic as France's worst health crisis in a century and announced schools, universities and day-care centres would be shut from Monday;•Portuguese Prime Minister Antonio Costa ordered the shut-down of schools and universities and placed limits on the number of people in nightclubs, restaurants and shopping centres at any one time;•Belgium announced the closure of all schools, restaurants, cafes and nightclubs and also banned recreational and sporting events in its fight to contain the growing epidemic;•Danish authorities called on shoppers to avoid excessive stockpiling after it closed schools and universities and suspended indoor events with more than 100 participants;•Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon revealed gatherings of 500 people or more would be stopped from Monday and school trips would be cancelled;•Germany shut nightclubs and schools after Chancellor Angela Merkel warned that up to 70 per cent of the country's population - 58million people - could contract the coronavirus;•Spain locked down four towns in Catalonia, shut schools and universities and suspended Parliament after its deputy prime minister was in self-isolation after his wife tested positive for the virus;•An Italian medical chief died of the coronavirus at the age of 67, as the death toll in the country - the centre of Europe's escalating crisis - jumped to over 1,000;•Australia's Prime Minister Scott Morrison announced the government will effectively ban 'non essential' public gatherings of more than 500 people from Monday.Sir Patrick Vallance, the UK's chief scientific adviser, has today defended the Government's approach and its lack of hardline response along the lines seen across Europe.He told Sky News: 'We've got a panel of very world leading scientists across epidemiology, mathematical modelling, virology, clinicians, and we're taking input from leading academics to try and come up with a plan that actually does what we want to do.'It doesn't mean that the others are doing something wrong, and in fact much of the advice and much of the actions, if you look at them, they are trying to achieve the same thing.'And that is to try to reduce the peak of the epidemic, flatten it and broaden it so that you don't end up with so much intense pressure on healthcare systems at one time'.He added: 'And mass gatherings of course are a place where you can potentially get infection from somebody, but the alternative is also important that if you're not at a mass gathering, you're at a small gathering, and most of the transmission of these types of viruses occur in small gatherings, not in big gatherings'. Sir Patrick insists that telling people with cold and flu-like symptoms to stay at home for a week will have an impact.He said: 'The measures that were announced, which is about self-isolation, even if you've got very mild symptoms, will mean a large number of people actually at home, being isolated because of this infection.'That's a very big measure actually, it's going to have quite a big impact across a number of households and a number of people, so I don't think that's a trivial measure at all.'And all the modelling suggests that these sorts of measures, and the other two that we discussed yesterday, the ones that have the biggest impact'.Boris Johnson yesterday branded coronavirus the 'worst public health crisis in a generation' and warned that 'many more' people are going to die - but still held off drastic measures. Mr Hunt, chair of the Commons health and social care committee, said he was also 'personally surprised that we're still allowing external visits to care homes'. The Prime Minister said it was clear the disease will continue to spread around the world and people should brace for the 'reality' of 'severe disruption' for many months.At a press conference in Westminster, Mr Johnson formally declared that the UK's tactics have shifted from 'containing' the killer disease to merely 'delaying' its inevitable spread, after he chaired a meeting of the Cobra emergency committee. The Government's new plan urges anyone with even mild coronavirus-like symptoms - a persistent cough or a fever - to quarantine themselves at home and to sleep alone if possible and stay at least two metres from relatives.The PM has also recommended all overseas school trips be cancelled while people over the age of 70 or those with pre-existing serious medical conditions have been told not to go on cruises.But he stopped short of more extreme measures such as closing schools and banning mass gatherings which have been adopted in Ireland, Norway, France and Italy in an effort to stem the spread of the virus. 'At all stages we have been guided by the science. We will do the right thing at the right time,' Mr Johnson said. The number of UK cases has risen by 130 and the death toll hit 10 in the last 24 hours, with experts increasingly bracing for turmoil as the overwhelming majority of the population becomes infected and the country develops 'herd immunity'. But chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance said he believed the true number of infections was likely to be 5,000-10,000 already. He estimated that the UK was four weeks behind the trajectory of the crisis in Italy - which has brought the country to its knees.The peak of the outbreak in the UK might not come for 10-14 weeks, the experts said - suggesting it will run into June.

WHAT IS HERD IMMUNITY AND WILL IT EVEN WORK?  Herd immunity is a situation in which a population of people is protected from a disease because so many of them are unaffected by it that it cannot spread. To cause an outbreak a disease-causing bacteria or virus must have a continuous supply of potential victims who are not immune to it.Immunity is when your body knows exactly how to fight off a certain type of infection because it has encountered it before, either by having the illness in the past or through a vaccine.When a virus or bacteria enters the body the immune system creates substances called antibodies, which are designed to destroy one specific type of bug.When these have been created once, some of them remain in the body and the body also remembers how to make them again. This provides long-term protection, or immunity, against an illness.If nobody is immune to an illness - as was the case at the beginning of the coronavirus outbreak - it can spread like wildfire.However, if, for example, half of people have developed immunity - from a past infection or a vaccine - there are only half as many people the illness can spread to.As more and more people become immune the bug finds it harder and harder to spread until its pool of victims becomes so small it can no longer spread at all.The threshold for herd immunity is different for various illnesses, depending on how contagious they are - for measles, around 95 per cent of people must be vaccinated to it spreading.For polio, which is less contagious, the threshold is about 80-85 per cent, according to the Oxford Vaccine Group.'This is more dangerous and it's going to spread further. And I must level with you and the British public: more families, many more families, are going to lose loved ones before their time,' he said. Despite the bloodcurdling warnings, Mr Johnson said the UK would not close schools yet even though government advisers admitted the move would help stem the outbreak. Advisers said the length of closure necessary to make the measure work could be more than 16 weeks and would at this stage therefore not be feasible. Chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance said it was not realistic to expect children to be cooped up that long. He said: 'It is true that there is some effect in closing schools but that effect is minimal and actually you would have to do it for 13 to 16 weeks or longer.'You do not have to be a very advanced mathematician to work out that the chances of keeping children not speaking to each other or playing with each other are zero.'Closing down schools could also put elderly grandparents at risk if they were asked to look after children, who are believed to be less susceptible to the most severe form of the disease but can still spread it.'The scientific advice is that this could do more harm than good,' Mr Johnson said. 'But we are keeping this under review and this could change as the disease spreads. Schools should only close if they are specifically advised to do so.'Mr Johnson conceded that Scotland was already banning mass gatherings, but suggested there was a 'particular issue with the resilience of their public services' north of the border, in a perceived swipe at Nicola Sturgeon after she undermined him by announcing her plans first.'We are not saying no to that sort of measures, of course not,' Mr Johnson said. 'We are keeping it up our sleeves. But it is very important... that we get the timing right.' [item name=video id=4183030 style=2 /]'Sleep alone, don't go for a walk and don't shake your dirty laundry': Government issues advice for people self-isolating   The Government issued a how-to guide for people forced to quarantine this afternoon.It came as Boris Johnson and his medical advisers said anyone with symptoms of coronavirus should stay at home for seven days. The guidance provides practical advice, including keeping away from all other human beings as much as possible.It includes: •You cannot go for a walk but you can use your own garden.•You can buy food and other supplies online but you must warn drivers to leave goods outside and do not invite them in.•Stay in a well-ventilated room with a window that can be opened.•Stay in a different room to other people you live with.•If that isn't possible stay two metres or three steps away from other people.•Sleep alone if possible.•Do not have visitors.•Use your own toothbrushes, eating and drinking utensils, dishes, drinks, towels, washcloths or bedlinen.•Use the kitchen at different times to others in the house and eat alone.•Use a dishwasher if you have one.•If you are breastfeeding, consider asking someone else to feed the baby using expressed milk in a bottle.•Bag personal waste like used tissues inside two bags and keep it away from other household waste for 72 hours before adding to refuse.•Do not shake dirty laundry; this minimises the possibility of dispersing virus through the air.•If you don't have a washing machine wait until after you isolation before going to a launderette.•Keep hydrated by drinking water.•Clean your hands frequently with soap and water for at least 20 seconds.Chief medical officer Prof Chris Whitty added: 'We need to do it at the last point it is reasonable so people maintain their energy and enthusiasm... it is important we do not ask our fellow citizens to do it for longer than makes sense.' The FTSE plunged by more than 10 per cent yesterday in response to the dramatic US announcement of a travel ban from Europe overnight, and growing global chaos. And in the latest high-profile victim of the outbreak, BT's chief executive, Philip Jansen, tested positive for COVID-19 on Thursday.'Having felt slightly unwell I decided as a precaution to be tested. As soon as the test results were known I isolated myself at home,' Jansen said in a statement. 'I've met several industry partners this week so felt it was the responsible thing to do to alert them to this fact as soon as I could.'Jansen said his symptoms seemed mild and he would work remotely over the coming week, avoiding disruption to the business of Britain's biggest telecoms group. The UK approach is increasingly at odds with that of other countries, with Ireland joining the list of those closing all schools and colleges and banning mass gatherings. In the first sign of splits within the UK, Nicola Sturgeon has declared that Scotland will also cancelling events with more than 500 people from the start of next week, saying that they take up too much time for emergency services.She admitted: 'These are not easy judgements. They are difficult and complicated.'The government has also made clear it will not follow Donald Trump's dramatic overnight move of closing the borders to travellers from mainland Europe. Instead Mr Johnson seems determined to take a limited response, asking those with a cold to self-quarantine, and urge vulnerable elderly people to stay indoors.How the UK's coronavirus 'battle plan' could unfold  CONTAIN Testing individuals reporting symptoms or returning from infected areas, isolating those who have coronavirus.Tracing how they contracted the virus, and everyone they might have come into contact with while infectious.Powers have been taken to force people into quarantine if they refuse to comply voluntarily. This stage of the UK's response has now ended.DELAY Ministers have ordered wider testing to assess prevalence in the community. Anyone with coronavirus-like symptoms is being asked to self-isolate.Sick pay provision has been bolstered to make the self-employed and low-paid workers more likely to comply. Further up the so-called 'ladder' of response options, vulnerable people could be urged to stay indoors, schools could be closed, and sports and public gatherings could be banned. Ministers say the scientific advice does not yet support that - although Ireland is closing schools, and Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon is banning gatherings of more than 500 people.The government has also rejected the US approach of barring travellers from mainland Europe for the moment. MITIGATE If the outbreak runs out of control, the NHS could cancel all non-urgent activity to focus on treating those affected.In an extreme situation, troops could be deployed to shore up the police and essential public services.Recently-retired doctors and nurses would be brought back to help plug gaps in the NHS, with many health workers expected to be infected along with regular members of the public. Former Cabinet minister Rory Stewart this afternoon accused the PM of 'smug insular complacency, warning that without quick action there could be 100,000 cases in the UK within the next 24 days.'This is at risk of becoming an example of smug insular complacency - refusing to pay any attention to what any other country is doing or the successful public health approach in Asia,' the London Mayor hopeful said. 'We should show some humility, learn from others and act now.' On another day of frantic activity by politicians and health experts around the globe: •Irish PM Leo Varadkar has declared that schools, colleges and childcare facilities are to close for two weeks;•Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon declared that she is 'minded' to cancel mass gatherings of over 500 people from the start of next week to avoid them sucking up resources for police and health workers;•The US Congress is shutting the Capitol, House and Senate office buildings to public until April 1 in reaction to coronavirus;•The Electoral Commission has called for the local and mayoral polls due in May to be postponed until the Autumn;•The UK and the EU jointly announced that face to face Brexit trade talks next week would not go ahead as planned but they could be conducted using video technology;•The FTSE 100 fell by more than 9 per cent as investors were rattled by US travel restrictions imposed by in an attempt to halt the pandemic;•The Czech Republic is closing its borders to travellers crossing from Germany and Austria and also banning the entry of foreigners coming from other risky countries to contain the coronavirus outbreak;•Norway and Lithuania are shutting down nurseries, schools and universities for at least two weeks, and Oslo has told workers to stay at least one metre apart in offices;•Labour has cancelled a conference to announce the results of its leadership contest, saying the replacement for Jeremy Corbyn will now be declared at a 'scaled back' event on April 4;•Canadian PM Justin Trudeau has self-isolated while his wife awaits the results of a coronavirus test;•The WHO warned that the travel ban announced by Mr Trump will do little to help combat coronavirus in the UK and could backfire by making people complacent;•Mr Sunak said he made 'no apology' for turning on the spending taps to counter the effects of the virus on the UK economy and society;•A Cabinet minister is awaiting the results of a coronavirus test, with four other MPs in quarantine after health minister Nadine Dorries became the first politician to be diagnosed with the disease;•Tube and transport systems were quieter than usual as the public preempted the expected advice from government on restricting social contact;•Sporting events have been called off, with golf set to be played without crowds and the tennis tour put on hold for six weeks;•Sittings in Parliament could be scaled back and the authorities are considering closing to visitors amid fears of spread on the estate.                     Early lockdown 'can cut coronavirus infections'                    Shocking charts show how the UK Government could prevent hundreds or even thousands of deaths by taking dramatic action now to fight the killer coronavirus and 'flatten the curve' of its spiralling epidemic.Prime Minister Boris Johnson decided not to move forward in Britain's fight against COVID-19, declining to close schools, send people home from work or ban large gatherings.But he is coming under intense scrutiny for refusing to budge - one frustrated scientist warned: 'Now is the time for the UK government to ban large gatherings, ask people to stop non-essential travel, recommend employers shift to home working and ramp up the response.'Official advice currently doesn't go much further than telling citizens to wash their hands even though the UK now has more cases than China did when Wuhan's 11million people were forced into lockdown.Scientists and critics are urging the Government to do more to prolong an inevitable surge in cases, saying that a spike of infections could cripple the NHS but spreading the cases over a longer period of time would 'flatten the curve' and make it easier for the nation to cope. An analysis of statistics has shown that areas that acted fast have slashed their death rates by up to eight times compared to those who react after the virus has taken hold.In South Korea, for example, an area home to 2.5million people was put into lockdown when just 204 people had been diagnosed and one had died. The country now has a death rate of just 0.8 per cent despite more than 7,800 cases.But in Italy, large-scale lockdowns were not brought in until Sunday, March 8, by which time it had more than 5,800 patients. There are now almost 12,500 and 827 deaths - a death rate of 6.6 per cent. Ms Sturgeon said this evening that Scotland was shutting down public events 'that have the potential to have an impact on our frontline emergency services'.'This is not a move that we are making because the science has told us it will have a significant impact on the spread of the virus: on the contrary, the scientists tell us it will not have a significant impact on the spread of the virus - although no significant impact does not equate to no impact at all,' she said.'But there are wider reasons that I consider and have judged that are important in reaching this decision.''Certain events, whether or not they need dedicated ambulance cover, we know that certain events have an impact on our policing and our front-line health services, accident and emergency and ambulance services.'At a time when pressure on those services is going to be considerable ... it is incumbent on government to do what we can to remove unnecessary burdens on our public services.'The decision is set to come into force the day after Rangers host Celtic in one of this weekend's Ladbrokes Premiership fixtures, with the champions currently 13 points clear of their rivals.Prof Whitty said the UK would not be introducing social distancing measures yet as it was not the right moment within the pandemic.But he warned that advice would be coming for elderly and vulnerable people to isolate themselves from social gatherings.He said: 'The next stage along we are going to want to do a package of things that are about putting social distancing around the people who are older and those with severe health conditions.'But we do not think it is appropriate to make a national recommendation for that at the moment because it is too early in the course of the epidemic.'If you think about what would happen if you prematurely put elderly or vulnerable in a situation where you're saying, we really want to cut down on your social interactions, to cut back on your contact with others, it has big practical implications for them and may lead to loneliness and other issues which are clearly very undesirable for them.'While we will need to move to that stage, we do not think this is the right moment along the pandemic to do so. But that point will come.'Eariler, Mr Johnson swiped at political leaders who do not 'follow the science'. In comments made before Mr Trump's announcement, he said many leaders were 'under a lot of pressure to be seen to act'. Asked whether the PM knew of Mr Trump's escalation in advance, Downing Street said: 'UK and US officials are in regular contact.' To fight what is now officially a global pandemic, the Budget handed hospitals a £5billion fighting fund while thousands of firms will be given a business rates holiday to help avert the risk of bankruptcy.Sick pay will be reformed to ensure that employees are not penalised for going into quarantine. In a round of interviews, Mr Sunak told the BBC: 'I make absolutely no apology for responding in the short term in scale to the immediate threat that we face from coronavirus. 'I think that's the right thing to do for the economy, we need to help businesses have a bridge to get to the other side.'His package came as the Bank of England's base rate was slashed to an historic low of just 0.25 per cent. Irish PM Leo Varadkar has declared that schools, colleges and childcare facilities are to close for two weeks.He made a live statement to the nation from Washington DC, where he is due to meet Mr Trump later as part of the annual St Patrick's Day programme of events. 'Unfortunately we must face the tragic reality that some people will die,' he said.Mr Varadkar said he was acting on fresh advice from the country's National Public Health Emergency Team.'The virus is all over the world, it will continue to spread but it can be slowed,' he said. Dr David Halpern, head of the UK's Behavioural Insights Team dubbed Britain's 'Nudge Unit' who reports directly to Mr Johnson, has suggested the 500,000 people in UK care homes or with respiratory conditions could be the only people protected.He has suggested the virus can be beaten by letting it spread through healthy people to kill it off rather than a nationwide lockdown that could allow coronavirus to rise again later in the year.Dr Halpern has revealed ministers are considering a policy of keeping high-risk groups such as the elderly or those with underlying health conditions isolated in care homes or in their own homes over the coming months.He said: 'There's going to be a point, assuming the epidemic flows and grows as it will do, where you want to cocoon, to protect those at-risk groups so they don't catch the disease.'By the time they come out of their cocooning, herd immunity has been achieved in the rest of the population'. Deputy chief medical officer Jenny Harries was asked on the BBC if 'pretty much everyone will get it eventually'.'The thing about a new virus is, of course, nobody has antibodies ready-made to it. This virus is having a field day, the desire will be to infect as many people as it can,' she said.Dr Harries said it was possible that 'up to 80 per cent of the population' could contract the virus, but added that it was a 'very high estimate'.Scottish First minister Nicola Sturgeon said it was not possible to make the virus 'go away'.'This is a serious situation. We cannot make this virus go away. It is highly likely now that significant numbers of us are going to get this virus,' she said.'The vast majority will have very mild illness and the clear focus right now is on doing everything we can to protect those who are more susceptible to serious illness, but we cannot make this go away, we need to focus on how we manage this outbreak, delay the spread and reduce the numbers infected at any one time.'Scottish Secretary Alister Jack told BBC Radio Scotland's Good Morning Scotland programme there is 'no doubt we are not going to be able to contain it for very much longer' and that efforts will now focus on delaying the spread of the virus to 'put less pressure on the NHS'. Speaking hours after world health officials declared the coronavirus a pandemic, Trump repeatedly defended his own actions and vowed the nation would prevail in countering the virus and getting treatment on the market.'We will be suspending all travel from Europe to the United States for the next 30 days,' Trump announced, in a speech from the Oval Office to the nation. 'The new rules will go into effect Friday at midnight,' he said. The move was so sudden the acting Homeland Security secretary said he would issue full guidance on how to carry it out within 48 hours.The White House said the travel restrictions would apply to foreign nationals who have visited 26 European countries - but excluding the UK and Ireland - in the past 14 days. It will not apply to US citizens, their 'immediate' family members or legal permanent residents. But confusion remained over how exactly the rules would apply and in what time zone the deadline would be introduced. Chancellor Rishi Sunak said the UK was not following the US example.'The advice we are ...",Web Publication

Social media users reported quieter than usual trains travelling to cities including London, Glasgow, Edinburgh, Sheffield, Newcastle, Birmingham and Cambridge.One Twitter user said: 'It's so quiet for the rush hour train to Newcastle ... everyone in scarves or masks and you can tell the sheer fear has hit.' Another wrote: 'Eerily quiet on the trains this morning but business as usual on the ward. Has the feel of those weird days between Christmas and New Year.' The mass stayaway came after the Prime Minister said people with even mild symptoms, including a continuous cough or high temperature, must stay at home for at least seven days.Boris Johnson's guidance was issued yesterday with between 5,000 and 10,000 people in the UK already thought to be infected with coronavirus, when the official figures show 596 cases and ten deaths. The Government's softer approach to shutting down communities when compared to other countries has triggered a row as critics including former ministers Jeremy Hunt and Rory Stewart branding the decision to keep schools open and not to ban major gatherings 'concerning' and 'dangerous'.As the UK's coronavirus situation escalates, global developments include: •A Chinese spokesman accused the US military of bringing the coronavirus to Wuhan - the Chinese city where the COVID-19 outbreak began at the end of December;•A 37-year-old US woman who beat the infection claimed she didn't suffer the tell-tale symptom of a cough and instead only had a headache and tingling arms and legs;•French President Emmanuel Macron declared the pandemic as France's worst health crisis in a century and announced schools, universities and day-care centres would be shut from Monday;•Portuguese Prime Minister Antonio Costa ordered the shut-down of schools and universities and placed limits on the number of people in nightclubs, restaurants and shopping centres at any one time;•Belgium announced the closure of all schools, restaurants, cafes and nightclubs and also banned recreational and sporting events in its fight to contain the growing epidemic;•Danish authorities called on shoppers to avoid excessive stockpiling after it closed schools and universities and suspended indoor events with more than 100 participants;•Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon revealed gatherings of 500 people or more would be stopped from Monday and school trips would be cancelled;•Germany shut nightclubs and schools after Chancellor Angela Merkel warned that up to 70 per cent of the country's population - 58million people - could contract the coronavirus;•Spain locked down four towns in Catalonia, shut schools and universities and suspended Parliament after its deputy prime minister was in self-isolation after his wife tested positive for the virus;•An Italian medical chief died of the coronavirus at the age of 67, as the death toll in the country - the centre of Europe's escalating crisis - jumped to over 1,000;•Australia's Prime Minister Scott Morrison announced the government will effectively ban 'non essential' public gatherings of more than 500 people from Monday.[related]What to do if a worker has coronavirus  By MINI SETTY, a partner in employment law at Langleys SolicitorsIf an employee has coronavirus then the business' usual sickness absence policy will come into effect. All employers should have an effective sickness absence policy, which will help them manage workplace absences consistently and effectively.Ahead of any further spread of coronavirus, it is recommended that employers should remind their employees of the required standards of attendance and what is expected from them. This is also a good opportunity to remind workers of hygiene standards and other policies of the business.Businesses should also consider implementing an infectious diseases strategy which details the Company's response to the spread of infectious diseases. This will safeguard a business from any similar future outbreaks. Arriving at Manchester Piccadilly train station this morning was project manager Rizwan Atcha, 37, who told MailOnline: 'I've come from Bolton, the train was eerie.'Normally you can't get any space but today there was more than usual. I'm assuming that was because of the virus. 'I have driven to Manchester before but it takes twice as long. In terms of taking the risk I'm ready to meet my maker.' Nick Parker, 44, a mortgage lender from Buckingham, said: 'I come through from Milton Keynes once or twice a week.'It was quieter than normal and so was the station, no one was acting strangely but that's because there was only about four people in the carriage. You've just got to get on with things.'Leszek Monouszko, 34, a flight attendant from Dubai, added: 'I've come on the train from Manchester Airport, I came into Manchester yesterday as I work as a flight attendant.'I'm worried for my work but my health not so much. I think people our age should not be worried so much.'While exact passenger numbers were not available, the Rail Delivery Group confirmed they are lower than usual.A spokesman said: 'Our primary focus during the coronavirus outbreak is to keep our passengers and our people safe, and the country moving.'He added: 'While the Government is not advising people to avoid public transport, unless they are showing symptoms of coronavirus, and rail companies are enhancing their cleaning on trains and at stations, we are seeing fewer people choosing to travel.' The Government's decision not to announced stricter rules on travelling or gathering in crowds has prompted a political row, with Tory ex-ministers slamming Mr Johnson's course of action. Jeremy Hunt, former Health Secretary and now chair of the Commons health and social care select committee, believes the PM must do more to encourage social distancing - and was particularly concerned care homes are not being told to ban visitors. While Rory Stewart, London mayor candidate who led the UK's effort to fight Ebola in Africa in 2019, said: 'I think we can be very tough, and clear [with the British public]. This is the worst pandemic we have had for 100 years.'The Government's approach is essentially defeatist. They are saying we cannot suppress this. They say there is no point in spending a huge amount of money trying to suppress this, instead they are trying to manage the increase. We are taking far too much risk.'I think that is a dangerous thing to do. I don't think if we allow this to spread it can be managed in that way.'And when you start getting serious numbers of people dying and the terrible choices that have to be made in hospitals, people will think that paying the cost early, now, was the right thing to do.'Mr Stewart, who is now an independent politician after leaving the Conservative Party, added: 'I'm absolutely confident that acting early is the better option. I would be shutting all schools and banning all gatherings immediately.'I think it is too pessimistic and defeatist and we should be taking the approach seen in China and South Korea that have actually reduced the number of cases. It can be done. It requires very tough and extreme measures.'The Government questions whether the public is up for the kind of measures we have seen in other countries. I disagree, I believe the British public will do what others have done'.Debate is raging over whether the Prime Minister has gone far enough to protect the UK's 66million people from the pandemic.The official number of coronavirus cases in the UK yesterday jumped by 134 to 596 with 10 deaths - but the Government's chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance said the true number was probably up to 10,000 cases and growing rapidly. But Mr Johnson has still held off drastic measures enforced across Europe such as banning mass gatherings and closing schools, telling Britons that the most important measure remains to wash hands for 20 seconds - and told people to stay at home for seven days if they have a new persistent cough or a high temperature. A ban on flights to and from Europe - like the one announced by US President Donald Trump - was also dismissed by the Government yesterday. Asked about the decision not to cancel large gatherings yet, with 70,000 at Cheltenham for the Gold Cup today, Jeremy Hunt told the BBC's Newsnight: 'I think it is surprising and concerning that we're not doing any of it at all when we have just four weeks before we get to the stage that Italy is at.' What is the government guidance on the virus?

(See Ending Isolation section below for more information)this action will help protect others in your community whilst you are infectious.plan ahead and ask others for help to ensure that you can successfully stay at home.ask your employer, friends and family to help you to get the things you need to stay at home.stay at least 2 metres (about 3 steps) away from other people in your home whenever possible.sleep alone, if that is possible.wash your hands regularly for 20 seconds, each time using soap and water.stay away from vulnerable individuals such as the elderly and those with underlying health conditions as much as possible.you do not need to call NHS111 to go into self-isolation. If your symptoms worsen during home isolation or are no better after 7 days contact NHS 111 online. If you have no internet access, you should call NHS 111. For a medical emergency dial 999.Mini Setty, a partner in employment law at Langleys Solicitors said: 'As the UK attempts to delay the peak of the virus, millions of Britons are getting ready to work from home and considering ways to 'socially distance' themselves from others.'Thousands of businesses, are frantically making plans to better enable remote working during this time, setting up conference facilities to connect businesses with their clients and putting in place operational strategies in the event a member of their workforce tests positive for COVID-19 or their offices have to shut'.Adam Pennington, employment law solicitor at Stephensons, told MailOnline: 'As the coronavirus pandemic takes a firm grip in the UK, it's clear that many businesses are now exploring options for staff to work from home wherever possible. It's expected that thousands of workers will take up home working opportunities over the next few weeks and from what we have seen many have already begun to do so. 'An IWG Global Workplace survey found 61 per cent of companies currently allow their staff to work remotely, meaning as many as 20 million UK workers already can work from home as pandemic worsens and the safeguarding measures continue.'If schools and universities are asked to close by the Government, the number of people working from home will surge in the coming days.'Meanwhile in the West Midlands, Birmingham New Street train station was busy as usual but passengers spoke of 'emptier trains' and lots of 'hand sanitizer'. Paul Burne, 35, a father of two who works as a sales manager, said he had to reduce his travelling due to coronavirus.He said: 'I travel almost every day because of my work and I think trains are as busy as always, I can't see a massive amount of change.'I haven't seen many people taking any precautions apart from hand sanitizer. I try to be as hygienic as possible. I'm more careful of what I eat and try to keep fit and healthy.'I have already reduced my trips as much as I could, but am a bit more reluctant to travel to London due to the congestion so overall I've made some slight changes.' Sophie Pearce, 18, a student, said: 'I travel every day to go to college so I think I am more at risk. There are so many people on the train and you don't know who's washed their hands or not, who's got it or not.'I would certainly not take the train at all and stay home if I could. Trains are busy as always I don't think people have stopped travelling because of coronavirus'.Another student, Jasmine Gardener, 18, said: 'There aren't many people taking precautions. I've only seen a few using hand sanitizer- as soon as someone coughs though, you notice everyone turning around.'I use hand sanitizer and wash my hands but I'm not that worried yet. If I could stay at home I would though, just because I get the train every day.'The Government has now ordered school trips to be stopped and people over 70 with serious medical conditions not to go on cruises. Officials have also warned the advice is likely to develop so that entire households could be told to self-isolate.The Government said it would not move to close schools yet as the evidence for its effectiveness is lacking, though this will be kept under review.It is also considering banning large events, mostly due to the burden such events place on public services.[item name=video id=4183972 style=2 /]High-profile people to be diagnosed with Covid-19 include Arsenal head coach Mikel Arteta and BT boss Philip Jansen.Chelsea's full squad has also gone into self-isolation after winger Callum Hudson-Odoi tested positive for coronavirus.England's Chief Medical Officer, Professor Chris Whitty, said the peak of the outbreak is most likely still 10 to 14 weeks away.He said it is feared people will become 'fatigued' by more stringent measures if they are brought in too soon and therefore they would lose their maximum effect.The number of people who have tested positive for the virus in the UK rose to 596 while the death toll in British hospitals is ten.A Rail Delivery Group spokesman said: 'Our primary focus during the coronavirus outbreak is to keep our passengers and our people safe, and the country moving. 'While the government is not advising people to avoid public transport, unless they are showing symptoms of coronavirus, and rail companies are enhancing their cleaning on trains and at stations, we are seeing fewer people choosing to travel.'Popular sites in London such as the Tate Modern and Tower of London have also been left deserted, along with shopping areas of Piccadilly Circus and Regent Street.The Tate Modern's iconic Turbine Hall was almost empty. The art gallery usually gets more than 15,000 visitors each day, according to the latest figures.The National Theatre appeared deserted, despite several matinee showings. Staff members running a carousel by the London Eye said they feared they could go bust.At the Shard - a chance to see a view of London from the UK's highest building - only a couple of people waited in line, and staff members tried to hawk people from the street.The Tower of London, where visitors wait to see the Crown Jewels, was also deserted. A tour guide said: 'For the last two days it has been really quiet.'She added that the tourist attraction had 'contingency plans' in place as more stringent measures in place. Meanwhile there was no queue at St Paul's Cathedral.Many venues have slapped up signs warning people to wash their hands more frequently, and be wary of the Coronavirus.Meanwhile it emerged that a London Underground driver has tested positive for coronavirus. The man, who works on the Tube's Jubilee Line, had been off work this week after returning from holiday in Vietnam.An internal message to staff said the driver, based at the North Greenwich depot, had been self-isolating but had tested positive for Covid-19.'The operator is receiving support from health services and is continuing to follow Public Health England (PHE) advice to self-isolate.[item name=video id=4183318 style=2 /]'The train operator has recently returned from a trip abroad, where it is thought the illness may have been contracted,' said the memo.A Transport for London spokesman said the driver was receiving support from health services, adding that he was not working in a customer-facing area.'The safety of our staff and customers is our top priority and we are taking all necessary precautions.'The areas where the driver worked are being cleaned, including the depot and the trains, in line with guidance from Public Health England with whom we are working closely.'TfL has introduced an enhanced cleaning regime using additional substances to prevent the spread of the deadly virus on the city's public transport.The busiest stations and key interchanges are to being cleaned more regularly - even during the day.And TfL is at the final stages of testing a new, long-lasting cleaning agent that would provide anti-viral protection for up to 30 days.It hopes to begin using the new cleaner in the next couple of weeks, alongside specialist hygiene back-pack equipment to spray disinfectant across the network.Two ex-Tory ministers today tore apart Boris Johnson's 'risky' decision not to lockdown Britain to tackle the coronavirus 'national emergency' with Jeremy Hunt revealing he is 'surprised and concerned' and Rory Stewart calling the PM's plans to allow millions to be infected 'pessimistic' and 'defeatist'.Mr Hunt, who is now chair of the Commons health and social care select committee, believes the PM must do more to encourage social distancing - and was particularly concerned care homes are not being told to ban visitors. Mr Stewart, who led the UK's effort to fight ebola in Africa in 2019, said: 'I think we can be very tough, and clear, [with the British public]. This is the worst pandemic we have had for 100 years.'The Government's approach is essentially defeatist. They are saying we cannot suppress this. They say there is no point in spending a huge amount of money trying to suppress this, instead they are trying to manage the increase. We are taking far too much risk.'I think that is a dangerous thing to do. I don't think if we allow this to spread it can be managed in that way.'And when you start getting serious numbers of people dying and the terrible choices that have to be made in hospitals, people will think that paying the cost early, now, was the right thing to do'.Mr Stewart, who is running to be the next Mayor of London as an independent, added: 'I'm absolutely confident that acting early is the better option. I would be shutting all schools and banning all gatherings immediately.'I think it is too pessimistic and defeatist and we should be taking the approach seen in China and South Korea that have actually reduced the number of cases. It can be done. It requires very tough and extreme measures.'The Government questions whether the public is up for the kind of measures we have seen in other countries. I disagree, I believe the British public will do what others have done'.Debate is raging over whether the Prime Minister has gone far enough to protect the UK's 66million people from the pandemic.The official number of coronavirus cases in the UK yesterday jumped by 134 to 596 with 10 deaths - but the Government's chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance said the true number was probably up to 10,000 cases and growing rapidly. But Mr Johnson has still held off drastic measures enforced across Europe such as banning mass gatherings and closing schools, telling Britons that the most important measure remains to wash hands for 20 seconds - and told people to stay at home for seven days if they have a new persistent cough or a high temperature. A ban on flights to and from Europe - like the one announced by US President Donald Trump - was also dismissed by the Government yesterday. Asked about the decision not to cancel large gatherings yet, with 70,000 at Cheltenham for the Gold Cup today, Jeremy Hunt told the BBC's Newsnight: 'I think it is surprising and concerning that we're not doing any of it at all when we have just four weeks before we get to the stage that Italy is at.'He added: 'The issue is not whether you or I might get infected at a football match, it's who we go on to meet.' English football's leaders have taken matters in to their own hands today as players and managers fell ill, with all professional matches including the Premier League cancelled until April 3 at the earliest. [item name=video id=4183476 style=2 /][item name=video id=4183478 style=2 /]Italy - the world's worst-hit country after China - is in complete lockdown as the country's tally of deaths has topped 1,000 with more than 15,000 patients infected by the virus. In response to the growing threat across Europe, Ireland yesterday closed all schools, colleges and nurseries and banned gatherings of more than 500 people. Norway's Prime Minister Erna Solberg last night put the country on a footing never seen in peacetime, despite having recorded no coronavirus deaths yet. Ms Solberg took all the Irish steps as well as banning all health workers from leaving the country, and forcing anyone returning from abroad into quarantine, including the king and queen who have been on a state visit to Jordan. But controversially the British Government appears to be pursuing a policy of 'herd immunity' - where the majority of the healthy population will get and fight off the virus so that the disease cannot be spread easily any more. The elderly and ill will be 'cocooned' from the outside world to protect them for weeks or even months. Critics have warned the policy is high risk because there have been multiple reports in China of people getting it twice - and concerns from experts that coronavirus could mutate and infect hundreds of thousands again in the coming years unless there is a vaccine.In other developments today to the escalating global crisis, which has seen more than 131,000 patients across the world get infected: •A Chinese spokesman accused the US military of bringing the coronavirus to Wuhan - the Chinese city where the COVID-19 outbreak began at the end of December;•A 37-year-old US woman who beat the infection claimed she didn't suffer the tell-tale symptom of a cough and instead only had a headache and tingling arms and legs;•French President Emmanuel Macron declared the pandemic as France's worst health crisis in a century and announced schools, universities and day-care centres would be shut from Monday;•Portuguese Prime Minister Antonio Costa ordered the shut-down of schools and universities and placed limits on the number of people in nightclubs, restaurants and shopping centres at any one time;•Belgium announced the closure of all schools, restaurants, cafes and nightclubs and also banned recreational and sporting events in its fight to contain the growing epidemic;•Danish authorities called on shoppers to avoid excessive stockpiling after it closed schools and universities and suspended indoor events with more than 100 participants;•Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon revealed gatherings of 500 people or more would be stopped from Monday and school trips would be cancelled;•Germany shut nightclubs and schools after Chancellor Angela Merkel warned that up to 70 per cent of the country's population - 58million people - could contract the coronavirus;•Spain locked down four towns in Catalonia, shut schools and universities and suspended Parliament after its deputy prime minister was in self-isolation after his wife tested positive for the virus;•An Italian medical chief died of the coronavirus at the age of 67, as the death toll in the country - the centre of Europe's escalating crisis - jumped to over 1,000;•Australia's Prime Minister Scott Morrison announced the government will effectively ban 'non essential' public gatherings of more than 500 people from Monday.Sir Patrick Vallance, the UK's chief scientific adviser, has today defended the Government's approach and its lack of hardline response along the lines seen across Europe.He told Sky News: 'We've got a panel of very world leading scientists across epidemiology, mathematical modelling, virology, clinicians, and we're taking input from leading academics to try and come up with a plan that actually does what we want to do.'It doesn't mean that the others are doing something wrong, and in fact much of the advice and much of the actions, if you look at them, they are trying to achieve the same thing.'And that is to try to reduce the peak of the epidemic, flatten it and broaden it so that you don't end up with so much intense pressure on healthcare systems at one time'.He added: 'And mass gatherings of course are a place where you can potentially get infection from somebody, but the alternative is also important that if you're not at a mass gathering, you're at a small gathering, and most of the transmission of these types of viruses occur in small gatherings, not in big gatherings'. Sir Patrick insists that telling people with cold and flu-like symptoms to stay at home for a week will have an impact.He said: 'The measures that were announced, which is about self-isolation, even if you've got very mild symptoms, will mean a large number of people actually at home, being isolated because of this infection.'That's a very big measure actually, it's going to have quite a big impact across a number of households and a number of people, so I don't think that's a trivial measure at all.'And all the modelling suggests that these sorts of measures, and the other two that we discussed yesterday, the ones that have the biggest impact'.Boris Johnson yesterday branded coronavirus the 'worst public health crisis in a generation' and warned that 'many more' people are going to die - but still held off drastic measures. Mr Hunt, chair of the Commons health and social care committee, said he was also 'personally surprised that we're still allowing external visits to care homes'. The Prime Minister said it was clear the disease will continue to spread around the world and people should brace for the 'reality' of 'severe disruption' for many months.At a press conference in Westminster, Mr Johnson formally declared that the UK's tactics have shifted from 'containing' the killer disease to merely 'delaying' its inevitable spread, after he chaired a meeting of the Cobra emergency committee. The Government's new plan urges anyone with even mild coronavirus-like symptoms - a persistent cough or a fever - to quarantine themselves at home and to sleep alone if possible and stay at least two metres from relatives.The PM has also recommended all overseas school trips be cancelled while people over the age of 70 or those with pre-existing serious medical conditions have been told not to go on cruises.But he stopped short of more extreme measures such as closing schools and banning mass gatherings which have been adopted in Ireland, Norway, France and Italy in an effort to stem the spread of the virus. 'At all stages we have been guided by the science. We will do the right thing at the right time,' Mr Johnson said. The number of UK cases has risen by 130 and the death toll hit 10 in the last 24 hours, with experts increasingly bracing for turmoil as the overwhelming majority of the population becomes infected and the country develops 'herd immunity'. But chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance said he believed the true number of infections was likely to be 5,000-10,000 already. He estimated that the UK was four weeks behind the trajectory of the crisis in Italy - which has brought the country to its knees.The peak of the outbreak in the UK might not come for 10-14 weeks, the experts said - suggesting it will run into June. [item name=video id=4183462 style=2 /][item name=module id=1163133 style=153 /]Mr Johnson insisted comparisons to seasonal flu were wrong. WHAT IS HERD IMMUNITY AND WILL IT EVEN WORK?  Herd immunity is a situation in which a population of people is protected from a disease because so many of them are unaffected by it that it cannot spread. To cause an outbreak a disease-causing bacteria or virus must have a continuous supply of potential victims who are not immune to it.Immunity is when your body knows exactly how to fight off a certain type of infection because it has encountered it before, either by having the illness in the past or through a vaccine.When a virus or bacteria enters the body the immune system creates substances called antibodies, which are designed to destroy one specific type of bug.When these have been created once, some of them remain in the body and the body also remembers how to make them again. This provides long-term protection, or immunity, against an illness.If nobody is immune to an illness - as was the case at the beginning of the coronavirus outbreak - it can spread like wildfire.However, if, for example, half of people have developed immunity - from a past infection or a vaccine - there are only half as many people the illness can spread to.As more and more people become immune the bug finds it harder and harder to spread until its pool of victims becomes so small it can no longer spread at all.The threshold for herd immunity is different for various illnesses, depending on how contagious they are - for measles, around 95 per cent of people must be vaccinated to it spreading.For polio, which is less contagious, the threshold is about 80-85 per cent, according to the Oxford Vaccine Group.'This is more dangerous and it's going to spread further. And I must level with you and the British public: more families, many more families, are going to lose loved ones before their time,' he said. Despite the bloodcurdling warnings, Mr Johnson said the UK would not close schools yet even though government advisers admitted the move would help stem the outbreak. Advisers said the length of closure necessary to make the measure work could be more than 16 weeks and would at this stage therefore not be feasible. Chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance said it was not realistic to expect children to be cooped up that long. He said: 'It is true that there is some effect in closing schools but that effect is minimal and actually you would have to do it for 13 to 16 weeks or longer.'You do not have to be a very advanced mathematician to work out that the chances of keeping children not speaking to each other or playing with each other are zero.'Closing down schools could also put elderly grandparents at risk if they were asked to look after children, who are believed to be less susceptible to the most severe form of the disease but can still spread it.'The scientific advice is that this could do more harm than good,' Mr Johnson said. 'But we are keeping this under review and this could change as the disease spreads. Schools should only close if they are specifically advised to do so.'Mr Johnson conceded that Scotland was already banning mass gatherings, but suggested there was a 'particular issue with the resilience of their public services' north of the border, in a perceived swipe at Nicola Sturgeon after she undermined him by announcing her plans first.'We are not saying no to that sort of measures, of course not,' Mr Johnson said. 'We are keeping it up our sleeves. But it is very important... that we get the timing right.'

Because 20 minutes later, it was immediately like I Am Legend out there.It is well known in behavioural psychology circles that people are far more likely to keep to rules they have set for themselves than those that are imposed on them from the top down, so deploying Johnson to instil the required levels of blind panic by telling everyone there's no need to panic is truly a stroke of genius.Ireland, Germany, Poland, France, Spain, Belgium... the list of countries now living under some kind of restrictions goes on. But it is only right here that everywhere is on self-imposed lockdown without the need for any heavy-handed government intervention at all.We can only wonder what will happen when we move into the next stages of the crisis.""Prime minister, we have reached the tipping point. The contagion cannot be stopped. We must activate Operation Bermuda Shorts.""""Righto. What's that again?""""It's simple. You say everything's fine, that the virus has gone away, and to prove it, you go on a series of pointless, contrived early morning runs through some of the worst affected areas, dressed, of course, in your usual, attention-grabbing Save the Children sportswear.""""And you're sure that'll work?""""Oh yes. All our research indicates that the only way to alleviate the now intolerable strain on the NHS that you spent 10 years stripping bare is to make even those in desperate need of treatment too frightened to leave the house. Only a clear statement from you that the crisis is over can achieve that at this stage.""""And what about when the crisis is actually over?""""What do you mean?""""You know, when we actually do want people to start going back to work? What will we do then?""""Ah yes. I see. That could be difficult. Prime minister, do you think you'd be any good at faking a cough?""At this point, I suppose I must ask, who the hell do I think I am? This is the greatest public health emergency in a hundred years. It is no laughing matter.Laughing at Brexit was a way to survive it. Laughing at coronavirus will be much, much harder. Not least as many people, frankly, will not survive it.Already, many of the prime minister's fiercest critics are now of the view that he must be afforded respect, for no reason beyond the enormity of the task he now faces. There is surely no one who wishes anything other than for Johnson to succeed, but success and respect are not the same. In the case of the latter, that boat has long since sailed.Weeks ago, in Italy and elsewhere, there was a public urge to treat coronavirus as if it were some kind of west-hating terrorist, that the way to show defiance was to carry on with life as normal.                     Two weeks ago, Nicola Zingaretti, the leader of Italy's Democratic Party, posted a picture of himself, having an early evening drink in a Milan restaurant, alongside the words, ""we need normality"".Zingaretti is now in isolation having contracted coronavirus.There is no doubting all this will utterly change how we live, what we do, completely, and quite right too. A contagion cannot be cowed through the best public sentiment. The price for realising that too late has been very high indeed.But it doesn't necessarily have to change who we are.

89,Herd immunity: will the UK's coronavirus strategy work?;Ministers look to have given up on containment in favour of a novel approach some experts are wary ofCoronavirus: latest updates,"March 13, 2020 Friday",International,The Guardian (London),504,504,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,Sarah Boseley,Herd immunity: will the UK's coronavirus strategy work?Ministers look to have given up on containment in favour of a novel approach some experts are wary ofCoronavirus: latest updates,"Herd immunity is a phrase normally used when large numbers of children have been vaccinated against a disease like measles, reducing the chances that others will get it. As a tactic in fighting a pandemic for which there is no vaccine, it is novel - and some say alarming.It relies on people getting the disease - in this case Covid-19 - and becoming immune as a result. Generally it is thought that those who recover will be immune, at least for now, so they won't get it twice.But allowing the population to build up immunity in this way - rather than through widespread testing, tracking down the contacts of every case and isolating them, as many other countries in Asia and Europe have chosen to do - could increase the risk to the most vulnerable: older people with underlying health problems.To reach herd immunity, about 60% of the population would need to get ill and become immune, according to Sir Patrick Vallance, the government's chief scientific adviser. Though it could need as much as 70% or more. Even scientists who understand the strategy are anxious. ""I do worry that making plans that assume such a large proportion of the population will become infected (and hopefully recovered and immune) may not be the very best that we can do,"" said Martin Hibberd, professor of emerging infectious disease at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine.""Another strategy might be to try to contain [it] longer and perhaps long enough for a therapy to emerge that might allow some kind of treatment. This seems to be the strategy of countries such as Singapore. While this containment approach is clearly difficult (and may be impossible for many countries), it does seem a worthy goal; and those countries that can should aim to do.""The government's ""nudge unit"" seems to favour this strategy. Dr David Halpern, a psychologist who heads the Behavioural Insights Team, said on BBC News: ""There's going to be a point, assuming the epidemic flows and grows, as we think it probably will do, where you'll want to cocoon, you'll want to protect those at-risk groups so that they basically don't catch the disease and by the time they come out of their cocooning, herd immunity's been achieved in the rest of the population.""But Anthony Costello, a paediatrician and former World Health Organization director, said that the UK government was out of kilter with other countries in looking to herd immunity as the answer. It could conflict with WHO policy, he said in a series of Twitter posts, which is to contain the virus by tracking and tracing all cases. He quoted Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the WHO director general, who said: ""The idea that countries should shift from containment to mitigation is wrong and dangerous.""Herd immunity might not even last, Costello said. ""Does coronavirus cause strong herd immunity or is it like flu where new strains emerge each year needing repeat vaccines? We have much to learn about Co-V immune responses."" Vaccines, he said, were a much safer way of bringing it about.",Newspaper
90,Are ministers playing a straight bat on pandemic?;Analysis,"March 13, 2020 Friday",International,The Daily Telegraph (London),933,933,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,Paul Nuki,Are ministers playing a straight bat on pandemic?Analysis,"The Government's strategy for flighting coronavirus is coming under scrutiny. While countries similar to our own are cancelling mass gatherings and closing schools, the UK's response remains distinctly low-key.Yesterday Boris Johnson announced new measures, including asking people with a cough or a temperature to stay at home, but some say it is not enough. Why are Ireland and Spain closing schools while we leave ours open? Why have France, Germany and now Scotland stopped gatherings of any more than 500 people while we carry on? Some accuse the Government of complacency. Others suspect it is putting the economy before the nation's health. And some say it has been seduced by new breed of behavioural scientists who are running a dangerous experiment in ""nudge theory"" which could go horribly wrong.The Prime Minister, the chief medical officer and others insist they are simply following the science. They are not shying away from tough decisions but nor are they bending to political pressure as others have. Acting too early, they stress, poses as much risk as acting too late.So who's right? Is the Government playing a straight bat? Or are there other agendas at work? Leading the critics is Richard Horton, editor-in-chief of The Lancet. Yesterday morning he chucked a metaphorical grenade into the debate and effectively accused the Government of lying via Twitter: ""The UK government - Matt Hancock and Boris Johnson - claim they are following the science. But that is not true. The evidence is clear. We need urgent implementation of social distancing and closure policies. The Government is playing roulette with the public. This is a major error.""Mr Horton's intervention has not been helpful from the Government's perspective. And by accusing ministers of ignoring ""the science"", he has raised questions about their motives. But there is common ground.All agree on the need to flatten the epidemic curve or ""squash the sombrero"", as the Prime Minister put it yesterday. This is vital so that health services are not overwhelmed.There is also agreement about the need for ""social distancing"" measures to do that. The Government is clear that self-isolation for the elderly and bans on large-scale gatherings will come. The real argument is over when they are best deployed, now or later.Martin Hibberd, professor of emerging infectious disease at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said: ""The UK response has clearly not been sufficient, as numbers are continuing to climb and we are at risk of following the trajectory of other European countries. If the aim is simply to delay the peak of the outbreak till the summer, then perhaps the UK response is enough.""However, the World Health Organisation (WHO) is challenging the world to do more and we know from China that aggressive curtailment policies can work to reduce numbers.""Devi Sridhar, professor of global public health at the University of Edinburgh, agrees: ""Now is the time for the UK Government to ban large gatherings, ask people to stop nonessential travel, recommend employers shift to home working and ramp up the response. The curve can be shifted (like South Korea and Singapore) but only with government action.""The Prime Minister and his advisers respectfully disagree. They note that when the moment comes, people over 70 may be asked to self-isolate for as long as 13 to 14 weeks.And then there are those ""nudge"" experts. ""Behavioural science shows that people start off with the best of intentions, but enthusiasm at some point lags"", said Prof Chris Whitty, the chief medical officer.The Spanish flu of 1918 featured mass gatherings that many experts point to today with alarm. But here again the Government says it has better evidence. ""On average one person infects two or three others. You therefore have a very low probability of infecting a very high number of people in a stadium, and a very high probability of infecting people close to you,"" said Sir Patrick Vallance, the chief scientific officer, yesterday.The bigger question may be what the Government is ultimately aiming for. Is it just trying to put the worst off until summer when the NHS is less stressed? Or is it trying to spread the impact out over a much longer period to give time to allow vaccines and treatments to become available? The answer is not clear. Sir Patrick said yesterday that it was ""not possible to stop everyone getting [the virus] and it's also not desirable, because we need to have some immunity to protect ourselves in the future.""This is a medical version of realpolitik. It suggests he at least may be leaning towards a summer blitz rather than the long-term squashing of the sombrero the WHO favours and governments appear to be aiming for in countries such as Singapore.A paper published in The Lancet by experts at Imperial College London and Oxford University last week made clear there were hard political choices ahead. Prof Sir Roy Anderson, the study's lead author said: ""Government needs to decide on the main objectives of mitigation - is it minimising morbidity and associated mortality, avoiding an epidemic peak that overwhelms healthcare services, keeping the effects on the economy within manageable levels, and flattening the epidemic curve to wait for vaccine development and manufacture on scale and antiviral drug therapies.

91,Care homes ban family visits to stem spread of coronavirus;Homes across UK taking action despite government not yet advising them to close doorsCoronavirus - latest updatesSee all our coronavirus coverage,"March 13, 2020 Friday",International,The Guardian (London),744,744,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,Amelia Hill,Care homes ban family visits to stem spread of coronavirusHomes across UK taking action despite government not yet advising them to close doorsCoronavirus - latest updatesSee all our coronavirus coverage,"Care homes across the country are banning visits from friends and family and keeping residents indoors in an effort to stem the spread of coronavirus.The government has not told care providers to shut their doors to all non-essential visits but the former health secretary Jeremy Hunt, chair of the Commons health and social care committee, told BBC Newsnight on Thursday he was ""personally surprised that we're still allowing external visits to care homes"".Mario Kreft, the chair of Care Forum Wales, which represents more than 450 care and nursing homes, advised people on Thursday morning to stay away. ""Simply put, not visiting care homes is likely to save people's lives,"" Kreft said.He called for bureaucracy to be cut so older people who no longer needed hospital care could be transferred to care homes, freeing up hospital beds.""We've got to do everything that we can to ensure that people are safe, and I would say this to anybody who wants to visit a loved one in a care home to think very, very carefully because totally accidentally, this virus could be transmitted,"" he said.Research from China has shown that over-60s make up more than 80% of coronavirus deaths. A study in the Journal of the American Medical Association calculates that the mortality rate for those aged 80 or older is 14.8%. For those aged 70-79, it is 8%, and for 60- to 69-year-olds it is 3.6%.Opinion is divided on how best to protect older people, however. The government's chief medical adviser has said pensioners currently do not need to self-isolate.But Dr Bharat Pankhania, who has devised national and international communicable disease control action plans, said the government was not doing enough to protect over-60s.He called for tighter restrictions, such as advising them against going to crowded public places, as had happened in the US.""I am not saying they should self-isolate but I am saying they should think about how many people they're around in public, because the mortality risk of that age group is unbelievable,"" he told Sky           News.Three care homes in Swindon, two in Northampton, two in Fife and all 25 homes run by the Balhousie care group in the north-east of Scotland have banned visitors. Several care homes in Jersey are asking people to stay away.One of Tayside's largest care homes is among a number of providers to have banned non-essential visitors.The bans followed after a positive test for coronavirus at Oakridge House care home in Basingstoke, Hampshire. It is not yet known if the person is a resident or staff member but the facility is now closed to all visitors.Downs View care home, Ashbury Lodge and Church View nursing home in Swindon, managed by Coate Water Care, shut their doors to visitors on Wednesday.""We are currently identifying a number of situations where we may make exceptions,"" said Coate Water Care's operations director, Sue Houldey.""These scenarios may include somebody being imminently end of life, or a major family incident. We are keeping this decision under review every two days.""The homes are still open for admissions and will receive GP visits and other medical support. B&M Care, which has 26 care homes across the country, has announced it is ""cocooning"" - placing residents in preventive isolation - in all its homes for two weeks.The Balhousie care group, which has 900 residents and more than 1,200 staff, has given residents iPads to maintain contact with friends and family. Only doctor and district nurse visits, and visits making essential deliveries and repairs will be allowed.A spokeswoman said there were no cases of coronavirus among its residents and staff and the move was a preventive measure.Rosturk House care home in Cupar and Peacehaven in Lundin Links - both in Fife - are allowing visits to residents only in exceptional circumstances. Abbeyfield and Palm Springs in Jersey are not allowing visitors in or residents out.Dr David Halpern, the chief executive of the government-owned Behavioural Insights Team and a member of Whitehall's Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies, told the BBC the government was considering a policy of cocooning those most vulnerable to coronavirus. ""There's going to be a point, assuming the epidemic flows and grows as it will do, where you want to cocoon to protect those at-risk groups so they don't catch the disease,"" he said.""By the time they come out of their cocooning, herd immunity has been achieved in the rest of the population.""",Newspaper
92,Behavioural scientists form new front in battle against coronavirus;Experts look at role of psychology in public responses to idea of quarantineCoronavirus - latest news,"March 13, 2020 Friday",International,The Guardian (London),792,792,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,Hannah Devlin Science correspondent,Behavioural scientists form new front in battle against coronavirusExperts look at role of psychology in public responses to idea of quarantineCoronavirus - latest news,"As epidemiologists work round the clock to calculate the mortality rate of Covid-19, its ease of transmission and other vital statistics, a different group of experts are interrogating the role that human psychology could play in the unfolding pandemic.The government's new measures, its experts said, took into account these behavioural factors, such as the potential for ""fatigue"" - the idea that public adherence to quarantines might wane over time.The implied logic was that asking less of the public this week could buy greater compliance down the line, when it is most crucial. Factors such as the potential for loneliness and stress in isolation were also considered.Prof Susan Michie, director of the Centre for Behaviour Change at University College London and a member of the government's advisory group, the Scientific Pandemic Influenza Group on Behavioural Science, said these assumptions are in part based on observations of human behaviour during past pandemics.The body of research included a rapid review published in the Lancet last month on the psychological impact of quarantine, which found that self-isolation can lead to post-traumatic stress, anxiety, depression and public anger.Indefinite quarantines with no well-defined end point - such as those imposed in Wuhan - risk having the most negative side-effects, the paper suggested, recommending that quarantines be restricted to the shortest time period possible and that the public be given a clear rationale for such measures.Other influential research includes a paper by the Economic and Social Research Institute in Dublin on how to harness behavioural science to fight the coronavirus. It found that extending isolation periods beyond initial suggestions risked demoralising people and increasing noncompliance. ""Thus clarity and certainty about timelines are both important,"" the paper concluded.The term ""fatigue"" conjures up middle-class sacrifices, such as feeling cooped up at home and being unable to visit friends or shops. But for some there are harsher realities that make compliance with extensive social distancing measures - like those employed in Italy - more difficult. So providing community-level practical support, as well as getting people to buy into public health advice, is crucial.""There are so many communities at the margins in terms of finance, who might not have enough food, whose homes are cold. I really haven't heard enough detailed plans about that yet,"" said Michie.According to Michie, governments often use what is termed the COM-B model of behaviour change, which states that in order to arrive at a particular, desired behaviour, people need to have the requisite capability, opportunity and motivation (COM). ""Unless you can tick all three of those, the behaviour is not going to happen,"" she said.The three essential ingredients can also be interlinked, she said. ""People will accept losing things and making sacrifices if there's equity. People need sick pay at a decent rate from day one, otherwise the inequalities could get greater and we want them to be reduced so people feel we're all in this together.""To gauge public opinion in the current pandemic, Michie said, the Department of Health had conducted weekly surveys looking at attitudes and awareness, with input from behavioural and psychological scientists. ""That's feeding into the government [decisions],"" she said. ""From the surveys, some people are worried, but some people are not that worried and are not changing their behaviour. There's a real mixture out there.""Against a backdrop of public ambivalence, expecting people to recede into prolonged quarantines might prove ineffective. ""The more concerned you are, the more likely you are to adhere to it,"" Michie said. ""If a big bunch of the population is not that concerned and you're asking people to sacrifice quite a lot, it won't be as effective if those two things are well-matched.""The government may also be factoring in spontaneous changes in behaviour, such as businesses allowing people to work from home, which have not required government intervention.""We're having change instigated at lots of different levels of society,"" said Michie. ""That's great, because we'll move as a whole. If you have a very top-down approach, you can build up resentment and lose people.""Michie said that while she was aware of some psychological evidence that is likely to have informed government decisions, she, and others, would like greater transparency about the evidence base.""It would be really helpful if they explained why we're not going further down the road of cancelling big events and so on,"" she said. ""We do know that transparency is really important for trust. And trust is really important for adherence.""",Newspaper
93,Coronavirus: science chief defends UK plan from criticism;Patrick Vallance says aim is to broaden peak of epidemic as Jeremy Hunt raises concernsCoronavirus - latest updatesSee all our coronavirus coverage,"March 13, 2020 Friday",International,The Guardian (London),843,843,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,Heather Stewart and Mattha Busby,Coronavirus: science chief defends UK plan from criticismPatrick Vallance says aim is to broaden peak of epidemic as Jeremy Hunt raises concernsCoronavirus - latest updatesSee all our coronavirus coverage,"Sir Patrick Vallance, England's chief scientific adviser, has defended the government's approach to tackling the coronavirus, saying it could have the benefit of creating ""herd immunity"" across the population.Critics including the former health secretary Jeremy Hunt have expressed concern about the decision to delay more drastic measures, such as school closures.However, Vallance said the government's approach was aimed at broadening the peak of the epidemic, and allowing immunity to build up among the population.""What we don't want is everybody to end up getting it in a short period of time so we swamp and overwhelm NHS services - that's the flattening of the peak,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.""Our aim is to try and reduce the peak, broaden the peak, not suppress it completely; also, because the vast majority of people get a mild illness, to build up some kind of herd immunity so more people are immune to this disease and we reduce the transmission, at the same time we protect those who are most vulnerable to it. Those are the key things we need to do.""He added: ""This is quite likely, I think, to become an annual virus, an annual seasonal infection.""Downing Street's approach, announced by Boris Johnson at a press conference on Thursday, contrasts with that of countries including            Ireland and France, where schools are being shut down.With experts from the "" nudge unit "" involved in determining how to shape the government's response, the shadow health secretary, Jon Ashworth, asked the health secretary, Matt Hancock, earlier this week for reassurance that the approach was not based too much on behavioural science.But Vallance sought to underline that it is the epidemiology that is guiding the decision not to impose more draconian restrictions on the public's day-to-day lives immediately.""If you suppress something very, very hard, when you release those measures it bounces back and it bounces back at the wrong time,"" he said. The government is concerned that if not enough people catch the virus now, it will re-emerge in the winter, when the NHS is already overstretched.Hunt, who is now chair of the health select committee, has said he is concerned that the government is allowing schools to remain open and large gatherings to go on as normal.He criticised the government for not going far enough and said the UK's response made it an ""outlier"" when compared with other countries that have taken more robust measures.Johnson announced on Thursday that anyone with coronavirus symptoms, however mild, such as a continuous cough or high temperature, must stay at home for seven days. He also said school trips abroad should be stopped, and people over 70 with serious medical conditions should not go on cruises.But Hunt suggested the government failure to take more stringent actions could lead to more people catching the virus and that schools should only remain open for the children of key workers.""Its extremely grave,"" he said. ""We are in a national emergency ... Many people will be very concerned [by the decision to keep schools open and not cancel large events].""The other message from the press conference was that if we are to give people the care they need, when the worst hits us, we need to 'flatten the peak' and spread the pressure on the NHS ... I'm personally surprised that we're still allowing external visits to care homes.""He said the issue was not necessarily whether healthy people became infected at football matches - all of which were suspended on Friday morning until 3 April, though rugby games are still scheduled to take place - but who they went on to meet in the days afterwards.""Whether we then go on to have tea with our friend who's recovering from cancer, our grandfather, grandmother,"" he said. ""That's the issue. I think it is surprising and concerning that we're not doing any of it at all when we have just four weeks before we get to the stage that Italy is at.""You would have thought every single thing we do in that four weeks would be designed to slow the spread of people catching the virus.""He agreed that the government's decision to keep schools open and allow large sporting events to continue cast the UK as an ""outlier"" in western Europe for its response to the coronavirus outbreak. The death toll in Italy has passed 1,000 people and Ireland, which shares a land border with the UK, announced on Thursday it would close schools, colleges and other public facilities for a fortnight.Jimmy Whitworth, a professor of international public health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, also said he was surprised stronger measures had not been introduced, but expected they would come in the next fortnight.""Based on evidence from other countries the most realistic approach to this is to initiate the strongest public health measures that will be supported by the general British public,"" he said.""I am surprised that stronger measures haven't been introduced at this stage but I anticipate that they will come in the next week or two.""",Newspaper

We will also work with the devolved administrations to ensure that they have the necessary powers to do the same.""Votes were due to be held in about 118 councils across England, while Londoners were to choose their mayor. The last time elections were delayed was during the foot and mouth outbreak in 2001.Confirmed cases of coronavirus jumped more than 200 today to 798, and pressure is growing on government to publish the model guiding its response to the outbreak.Opposition parties have demanded an explanation of why Britain is out of line with many other countries where schools have been closed and cities have been put into lockdown. They are also calling for independent scientists to be able to scrutinise the data that has led Britain to make different choices.After Ireland closed schools and Jeremy Hunt, the former health secretary, broke ranks to criticise Britain's approach and support for the government began to waver at Westminster for the first time.Gordon Brown, the former prime minister, said today that ""fears are still growing for our safety; for all the brilliance of Britain's medics, the government still seems behind the curve"".The World Health Organisation today said Europe was the new epicentre of the outbreak, with more cases and deaths than the rest of the world combined, apart from China.The declaration came as Britain becomes increasingly nervous about coronavirus, with some 38 per cent of people now saying they are scared at the prospect of catching it, up from 24 per cent a fortnight ago. Women are more concerned, with 35 per cent saying they feel scared, compared to 27 per cent of men.Public health messages about improving personal hygiene have hit home, with 61 per cent now washing hands frequently and using hand sanitiser, up from 35 per cent at the start of March. The proportion who avoiding touching objects like lift buttons has doubled from 14 per cent to 30 per cent, while the number avoiding crowded public spaces is up from 14 per cent to 24 per cent. Another 15 per cent are avoiding public transport, and 12 per cent are avoiding contact with tourists.Those working from home already doubled from 2 per cent to 4, but support for avoiding going into work has surged. Two thirds (66 per cent) want the government to encourage more homeworking, up from 45 per cent two weeks ago.Boris Johnson continues to enjoy the backing a the majority of voters, with 55 per cent saying the government is handling the crisis well. However, there is a partisan split, with 78 per cent of Conservative voters satisfied with the government's approach compared to only 37 per cent of Labour voters. Two weeks ago the figures were 71 per cent and 48 per cent.While Mr Johnson's strategy still enjoys cross-party support at Westminster, opposition parties began to voice frustration at a meeting with government officials yesterday.Concern was expressed over limited advice to the elderly and the role of behavioural scientists in advising against a lockdown, as well as international discrepancies in advice.Mr Johnson will spend the weekend calling world leaders in an effort to co-ordinate international action, despite suggesting other countries' response were more driven by politics than scientific evidence.""The prime minister thinks that this crisis affects countries around the globe and it requires a global response,"" his spokesman said.Sir Patrick Vallance, the government's chief scientific adviser, has concluded that locking down Britain would lead to more deaths than allowing a gradual peak because the virus would bounce back later in the year.""If you suppress something very, very hard, when you release those measures it bounces back and it bounces back at the wrong time,"" he told the BBC.""Our aim is to try and reduce the peak, broaden the peak, not suppress it completely; also, because the vast majority of people get a mild illness, to build up some kind of herd immunity so more people are immune to this disease and we reduce the transmission, at the same time we protect those who are most vulnerable to it.""However, the government has yet to publish the detailed figures behind its reasoning.Jonathan Ashworth, the shadow health secretary, said: ""The public are understandably raising concerns about the government's strategy and why we appear to be out of kilter with other countries. As well as a delay stage the government need an 'explain' stage. I'm urging the government to offer greater clarity and public more science so it can be better understood more widely, and peer-reviewed by experts in the field who are currently questioning our approach.""Liz Saville-Roberts, of Plaid Cymru, said: ""Government has duty to answer questions: first and foremost; why take a different approach to other countries across the world?""Government sources are furious with Mr Hunt, now chairman of the health select committee, for saying he was ""surprised and concerned"" government was not doing more.Today he warned ministers that ""the clock is ticking"" , as he called for tougher measures that stop people getting too close to each other. ""Singapore made an early decision to restrict social activities by older people. Or consider Japan, which, despite being the second country to get the virus outside China, appears to be succeeding in slowing its growth. They have closed schools, started disinfecting handrails in airports and told travellers and airport staff to wear face masks,"" he wrote in the                    Evening Standard                   .""The government is rightly following scientific advice, but even scientists have to make judgement and assumptions to inform their modelling.""The prime minister's spokesman said: ""We are very clear where we take our advice from.

95,Guided by the science'.. so why are others doing so much more?;CORONAVIRUS CRISIS: HOW WORLD IS TACKLING COVID-19 Experts on how battle plan affects you,"March 13, 2020 Friday",International,The Mirror (The Daily Mirror and The Sunday Mirror),1649,1649,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,OLIVER MILNE,Guided by the science'.. so why are others doing so much more?CORONAVIRUS CRISIS: HOW WORLD IS TACKLING COVID-19 Experts on how battle plan affects you,"THE Government stepping up its reaction to the coronavirus crisis could mean some big changes for you and your family - though other countries are doing far more.Here is what Chief Medical Officer Professor Chris Whitty and Chief Scientific Adviser Sir Patrick Vallance said yesterday…1 Why do other nations seem to be doing more?Schools in Italy, France and Ireland are closed, regions are in lockdown and America has banned incoming flights from Europe. But according to the British experts, drastic measures require the support of the public - meaning the timing of when they are introduced is key.Prof Whitty said: ""The important part of the science of this is the behavioural science. People start off with the best of intentions [of following the rules] but if you start too early, people's enthusiasm starts to run out just about at the peak, which is the time we want people to be doing these interventions. So we need to do it at the last point it is reasonable, so that people retain their enthusiasm through what will be difficult things to do.""2 What are the symptoms?LOCAL A high temperature - above 37.5C - and a new, continuous cough. Sir Patrick said modelling predicted a 20% to 25% reduction in the peak of the epidemic by getting people with should mild symptoms to stay at home for a week.Moving to whole-household isolation adds an extra 25% reduction - so together, those measures roughly halve the size of the peak. Preventing the elderly from getting infected could reduce death rates by 20% to 30%.3 Will there be more announcements?Prof Whitty spoke of the need of isolating older and more vulnerable people but that will not happen yet as it could have other negative consequences, like increasing loneliness. There is also no need to close schools now as the advice is that it could do more harm than good. But this may change. The Government could also advise anybody living with someone who is taken ill to self-isolate for seven days, taking the total to 14 days.4 What should I do if I feel ill?Prof Whitty said that potential patients should self-isolate for seven days. He said: ""It helps to protect older or more vulnerable people who they might come into contact with.""It is important that people with very minor symptoms do not call 111."" But if symptoms worsen they should use the helpline.Prof Whitty said the virus is at its most contagious when symptoms first appear - so that by seven days the majority of people are not infectious. ""The evidence would appear to be that some people with even quite mild symptoms can spread this virus to a lot of people. It is no longer necessary for us to identify every case and we will move from having testing mainly done in homes and outpatients and walk-in centres to a situation where people remaining at home do not need testing.""5 Are large-scale events such as football matches going to be cancelled?Not as a matter of course in the UK, apart from in Scotland, where First Minister Nicola Sturgeon took a decision to axe any events where more than 500 people are gathering.But that is not because of the spread - largescale events actually do not make the spread more likely. Instead, Ms Sturgeon said she put a stop to them to free up the NHS and other emergency workers. Boris Johnson said he was not taking a similar decision yet but that could change in the coming weeks and months.The PM said: ""We are considering the question of banning major public events such as sporting fixtures.""The scientific advice as we've said over the last couple of weeks is that banning such events will have little effect on the spread.""But there is also the issue of the burden that such events can place on public services. So we're discussing these issues with colleagues in all parts of the UK and will have more to say shortly about the timing of further action. At all stages, we have been guided by the science and we will do the right thing at the right time.""6 Are schools being closed?No. Unlike in Ireland and a number of other European countries, the UK has no plan to close schools.Sir Patrick said closing schools would have a knock-on effect as it would keep parents at home - including some needed to staff the NHS and other vital services.He said: ""It's true that there's some effect in closing schools but that is minimal and you'd have to do it for 13 to 16 weeks or longer. And you don't need to be a very advanced mathematician to work out that the chances of keeping children not speaking to each other or playing with each for 13 to 16 weeks is zero. Therefore you have to be very careful to make sure you take the right measures that will stop this rather than things which might end up with children, for example, going to stay with grandparents THE at the time they might be most vulnerable.""flame in private cut coronavirus. IOC insists Games will but is feared.Individual schools may be told to close if they have cases of the virus. All schools have been told to cancel any planned international trips.7 When is the peak of the infection going to be?Almost everything the Government is doing is designed to make the peak lower or further away, so the NHS can get out of its winter crisis. Sir Patrick said: ""We think the peak may be something like 10 to 14 weeks away [May 21 to June 18] - it could be a bit longer. And you want to try to make sure that the elderly are protected in the peak area. About 95% of people would be predicted to get the infection during the nine or 10-week period either side of the peak. About 50% would be infected in the three or four weeks either side on the current evidence. So to cover the peak, measures need to be in place for 13 or 14 weeks or so.""8 So what difference will these measures make?Explaining the advice for people to self-isolate for a week, Prof Whitty acknowledged it ""will interfere with their lives and work, and their social life in quite significant ways"". But he said ""it helps to protect older and more vulnerable people"" and will reduce, and possibly delay, the peak.oliver.milne@mirror.co.uk@OliverMilne total toLOCAL elections should be postponed from May 7 to the autumn as the pandemic could affect voting, the Electoral Commission told ministers.THE Olympic flame was lit in private yesterday, to cut coronavirus risk.

It was almost unreal. Like something from a film.""I must level with you, level with the British public: many more families are going to lose loved ones before their time.""That it was this prime minister, a man best known for waving fish, hanging on zipwires and getting through scrapes with a hair ruffle and a ""cripes"", was all the more shocking.Everyone watching will have thought of grannies and granddads and neighbours and quietly wondered if they are going to make it.Up to 10,000 may already be infected, despite official figures climbing to only 590.""This is the worst public health crisis for a generation,"" Boris Johnson said during the latest press conference, flanked by his boffins. It's not like seasonal flu. It's more dangerous and it's going to spread further.It was a real shift shift in tone from the semi-jovial stuff about which song to sing while you're washing your hands. Things got real.And for a modern country in the 21st century, this is what is hard to come to terms with. There is no easy fix. There is no way out of this. It is coming. It is coming fast. Bad stuff will happen. And there is almost nothing that you nor I nor ""they"" can do about it.It seems slightly bewildering now that a year ago this week we were fretting about whether or not Theresa May's government could survive as MPs voted down her duff deal for a second time. The stakes felt high at the time. Now we know what real stakes feel like.For all of the punditry and commentary I have seen in the past 24 hours, the most thoughtful and almost moving came from Julia Samuel, a psychotherapist who appeared on Sky News to explain why we find this so crisis disquieting:""We're used to somebody coming out, speaking on the telly like 'We've got this sorted and... we're doing the best we can'. But actually there's nothing we can do. And you know, a hundred years ago, everybody would expect that and they would have the endurance, the expectation they'll do what they can.""And we don't. We expect a pill or something that will fix it for us, or that you go to hospital and everything's better. So I think what we're having to learn is that we need to endure, we need to develop our own resilience.""In an era when we are used to instant gratification, to food and films and fun delivered whenever we want it, we now have to accept that not everything is fixable. There is no app for that.And I know that every day some people struggle, living on the edge financially, emotionally, mentally. But millions of people are used to everything being just OK. For the entire country to learn, together, that it isn't is a huge shock to the national psyche.Johnson insisted, calmly and without the Churchillian theatrics we might have expected: ""We will get through this, this country will get through this epidemic, just as it has got through many tougher experiences before, if we look out for each other and commit wholeheartedly to a full national effort.""Those tougher experiences of the past are not remembered by most. A national effort in the age of individualism is going to come as a shock.Samuel added that this period - the waiting and not knowing - is almost worse. ""An unknown virus or a plague... it just unsettles people. I think what you've imagined is always worse than reality. If somebody could say to you, 'Tomorrow you're going to wake up with coronavirus', you'd be scared but you'd kind of prepare yourself.""It's the imagining. So we have limitless imagination of am I going to be the one that dies? You know, or is my wife or my father or whatever it is. And that really scares us.""The question is what will that fear do to the country. Sir Patrick Vallance, the chief scientific adviser, says that the behavioural science suggests that we are likely to pull together: ""The biggest effect is not outbreaks of panic but outbreaks of altruism.""And there may be a wider impact too. Being more optimistic or patriotic or getting more retweets isn't going to work this time.After four years of cynicism of experts, of coveting those with whom you agree rather than those who might actually know, of blame and bitterness and bile, there is (I hope) a change in the air.Instead of automatically disbelieving those in positions of authority, we are desperate to believe that they know what they are doing. Or at least that they are doing it with the best of intentions.By the time we find out whether or not they were right, it will be too late. Johnson repeated his mantra that he is being led by the science, but no one has yet fully explained why this government has science which is telling it to do such radically different things to other governments.Italy is in lockdown; France and Ireland are closing schools; Japan is preparing to cancel the Tokyo Olympics; Australia is cancelling the Formula One Grand Prix; America is banning flights. And still Britain is focused on hand-washing and telling those with symptoms to stay at home.The UK government and scientific advisers insist that closing schools and cancelling mass gatherings have little effect on curbing the spread and may have unintended consequences: children have to be looked after by vulnerable grandparents; football fans congregate in pubs instead.Yet in Scotland Nicola Sturgeon, who crassly rushed from finding out what Cobra had agreed to announce Johnson's plan for him, is planning to ban large public events that require a police presence.Unusually, I have no glib joke or sarcastic point to make. I am not an expert. Rightly or wrongly, I am willing to put my faith in the prime minister and his advisers for now.Not because of any great love or admiration but because, frankly, that is the only option we have. The armchair epidemiologists raging on Twitter know no more than the rest of us, and probably a lot less.Anyone who has ""crunched their own numbers"" or ""saw something online"" or thinks it is ""common sense"" or it ""stands to reason"" that the government should be doing X or Y are missing the point: there is no correct answer. This is a judgment call. There is no option where there are no sick people and no deaths. We will not know who was right for months, years, possibly ever.Jeremy Hunt, the former health secretary who now chairs the health select committee, broke ranks to question the UK plan, comparing it to the aggressive approach of Thailand and Taiwan. He told Channel 4 News: ""One thing we do have now is evidence of countries that appear to have been strikingly successful in turning back the tide of the virus.""Sir Patrick Vallance mounted a strong defence of the UK approach this morning, telling Sky News that the self-isolation measures announced yesterday for those with a cough or fever ""will mean a large number of people at home being isolated - it is a very big measure actually, it's going to have quite a big impact"". He added: ""My job as chief scientific adviser is to speak scientific truth to power and say it as it is, and that is exactly what I will do.""Of course we are right to ask questions of the government, but some people will never be satisfied with the answers. In part we want a big crisis to be met with a big response. Stocking up on soap seems insufficient.The government has moved from contain to delay; from trying to stop us getting it to assuming we will all get it, just not all at once. That is why they are now saying that the UK peak could be ten to 14 weeks away. Instead of having a bigger peak earlier, we want a longer, lower hump.Johnson, who had been otherwise calm and sombre, described this as a ""squash the sombrero"" approach, adding: ""If we delay the peak even by a few weeks, then our NHS will be in a stronger state as the weather improves and fewer people suffer from normal respiratory diseases, more beds are available and we'll have more time for medical research.""The same number of people or perhaps more might get it, but over many more weeks. By delaying the spread, the NHS might be better able to look after and save some of those for whom a bad flu could be fatal.Herd immunity is being turned on its head: instead of vaccinating most of the population to stop the disease taking hold (there is no vaccine for Covid-19), ministers want most of the population to get it so that it cannot spread any further.But it needs to be staged. So those who fall ill soon will be asked to cut themselves off from everyone else, just as they might need them most.""The biggest thing that supports you in a time of crisis,"" Julia Samuel added. ""Is the love and connection to others.""That is why this feels hard: having to navigate the unknown, the unfamiliar sensation of a problem that cannot be solved with a click or a credit card, and doing it without the family, friends and colleagues who usually sustain us.This is going to be tough. Look after yourselves and be there for each other.",Newspaper; Web Publication
97,"The Guardian view on science and coronavirus: no certainties, just judgments;The government is sticking to its cautious approach in dealing with the pandemic. But action on the ground may be overtaking this strategy","March 13, 2020 Friday",International,The Guardian (London),708,708,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,Editorial,"The Guardian view on science and coronavirus: no certainties, just judgmentsThe government is sticking to its cautious approach in dealing with the pandemic. But action on the ground may be overtaking this strategy","Friday was the day when the coronavirus pandemic began to radically redraw the map of everyday life in Britain. Bill Shankly, Liverpool's much-loved manager in the 1970s, is fondly remembered for suggesting that football was more important than matters of life and death. It would have been a joke, of course. But the decision to suspend the Premier League until 4 April is a potent symbol of the new abnormality that will characterise the weeks and months to come. Slowly but surely, Britain's social life is being put on hold. The postponement of May's local elections signals the end of politics-as-usual as well.Millions of people are now facing difficult dilemmas and painful decisions. Across the country, some care homes have begun to close their doors to relatives. Many people this weekend will be thinking twice about planned trips to see vulnerable elderly family members, whose wellbeing is intimately linked to such visits. Soon these may not be possible for an indefinite period. A kind of stasis, shadowed by deep anxiety, awaits us, and the scale of what is to come is unknowable.The decision to suspend the Premier League followed the news that the Arsenal manager, Mikel Arteta, and a Chelsea footballer, Callum Hudson-Odoi, had both tested positive for coronavirus. On Thursday, Boris Johnson and his chief scientific adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance, both reiterated the government view that there were no medical grounds to ban sporting events. The football community went ahead and shut down stadiums anyway. Outside the confines of Whitehall, organisations and individuals appear to be outpacing the government's strategy for managing the pandemic.There is understandable concern that the approach of Mr Johnson, Sir Patrick and the chief medical officer, Prof Chris Whitty, is too minimalist. Britain has become an outlier in its approach to the crisis. The government's advice remains, for now, that those presenting symptoms of the disease should self-isolate for a minimum of seven days. Schools have been allowed to stay open, partly to enable key workers to stay at work. Leaving aside beleaguered Italy, where a national lockdown is in place, Germany, France, Ireland and the Netherlands have            all taken much tougher measures to ensure social distancing. China's drastic measures in Wuhan came at significant human cost but, according to official figures, the number of new cases has plummeted this week and authorities say they believe the outbreak has passed its peak.Experts, like the rest of us, have no access to infallible truths in unprecedented crises. The stakes could scarcely be higher, but the scientific bets being laid involve judgments, not certainties. The government, advised by Sir Patrick and Prof Whitty, believes that drastic action to suppress coronavirus could store up bigger problems down the line, when measures are relaxed. Therefore, they judge the least-worst outcome for the country will be a managed epidemic which peaks gradually, so that the NHS is not overwhelmed, and creates ""herd immunity"" to what could become an annual virus. There is also concern that forcing people into more isolated lives too soon could be counterproductive. Sir Patrick has predicted that the epidemic's peak in Britain could still be            10 to 14 weeks away ; too much isolation too soon could lead to coronavirus ""fatigue"", causing people to revert to old ways at precisely the wrong moment.That may or may not be an accurate prediction. But the existential reality on the ground is beginning to render the hypotheses of behavioural science irrelevant. Gatherings of all kinds are being cancelled and home-working strategies are being implemented. It might soon become desirable for the government to go with the grain and help direct a clear public appetite to do what it takes to minimise the impact of the inevitable.Levels of austere self-discipline known only in wartime may soon be required in the spring sunshine. Sadly, in this crisis, community spirit will be best expressed by keeping a distance from neighbours. It is a grim prospect. But as a form of national hibernation begins, it is at least reassuring that many of us seem ready to make the sacrifices that will have to be made.",Newspaper
98,Public showing healthy scepticism for fake news;SOCIAL MEDIA,"March 14, 2020",International,i - Independent Print Ltd,401,401,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,EXCLUSIVE By Jane Merrick POLICY EDITOR,Public showing healthy scepticism for fake newsSOCIAL MEDIA,"The public are becoming increasingly wary of social media coverage of coronavirus, including awareness of fake news and misinformation online, according to focus groups tracking people's response to the outbreak. Facebook, which is among several tech firms stepping up efforts to combat misleading information about the virus, is automatically associated with ""bullshit"", according to someone familiar with intensive public opinion research carried out this week.As the crisis escalates, the public are instead turning to scientific experts as well as trustworthy mainstream media sources such as the BBC, the research suggests.There are also suggestions that individuals are likely to be fairly stoical throughout what is expected to be three months of disruption.Despite concern that other countries are imposing more draconian measures, there is not a huge public appetite for measures like immediate school closures, research suggests.Amid signs that the Government's new instructions for people with even mild symptoms of Covid-19 to self-isolate for a week has triggered a second wave of panic buying, the research also suggests there is contempt for stockpilers and hoarders.There is ""huge knowledge that not everything on social media can be trusted"" showing that society has gradually adapted to the new information environment, the source said. The Government has been testing to public opinion to hone its response, including changing the phrase ""self isolation"" to ""stay at home""as the latter had more impact.It is also using the Behavioural Insights Team, or ""nudge unit"", which uses modelling and behavioural science to try to predict how the public will react.Herd immunity occurs when a high percentage of the population is vaccinated making it difficult for infectious diseases to spread, because there are not many people who can be infected. For example, if someone with measles is surrounded by people who are vaccinated against measles, the disease cannot easily be passed on to anyone, and it will quickly disappear again.However, there is no vaccination to protect against coronavirus - and there won't be one for 12 to 18 months. Therefore for the UK population to gain herd immunity, a large enough number of people - 60 per cent of the country, 40 million people, in the words of the chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance - will need to contract the virus and then recover.",Newspaper
99,We are all capable of changing how we behave - just look at Asians;Commentary,"March 14, 2020 Saturday",International,The Daily Telegraph (London),745,745,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,Paul Nuki,We are all capable of changing how we behave - just look at AsiansCommentary,"Nothing skews reason like a bit of old-fashioned prejudice. The charts above show dramatic differences in the way countries like Singapore, Hong Kong and Taiwan have responded to the epidemic compared to others in Europe.While the picture here is of exponential growth, the lines showing the spread of the virus in parts of Asia are flatter, suggesting the response there has been more effective. Even China, which was caught on the hop in Wuhan, has managed to dramatically subdue the spread of the disease. If such containment has been successful in places like Singapore, why is the Government here not looking to replicate it? Boris Johnson says he too wants to flatten the curve of the epidemic, but his ambition is more modest.Rather than spread it over six months or more, as they are aiming to do in parts of Asia, he wants to push it back a month or so into the summer and then let things rip. Most people will catch it and ""many more families are going to lose loved ones"", but Britain will have acquired ""herd immunity"" and we will have got it over with, says his scientific advisers.It all feels a bit biff, bang, bosh. The answer, it seems, sits with an Alf Garnett reading of our national temperament, and by reflection that of people in Asia.While behaviour change is possible in the UK, it can only be maintained for a short period before ""fatigue"" and noncompliance set in, explained Prof Chris Whitty, the chief medical officer yesterday. Put a ban on football matches and the masses will just decamp to the pub, added Susan Michie, a professor of health psychology and co-director of the Behavioural Sciences Policy Research Unit for England and Wales.Here is the other side of that coin. In authoritarian states like China, people are well used to doing what they are told and if they don't they end up in a gulag. And people don't value individual freedoms over there in the same way we do, don't you know? How else can one explain the sustained behavioural change in democractic Taiwan and South Korea? Those Asians, they are different, more submissive, the ugly trope goes. This is little more than stereotype and prejudice. People in Asia are no more subservient than we are fickle. They are behaving differently not because they have been coerced or are intrinsically different, but because they have been here before.In 2003, Sars, a coronavirus with a kill rate, not of 1-3 per cent, but 10 per cent, swept out of China and across the region. The speed and ferocity of the epidemic was terrifying. It infected 8,098 people and killed 774 before it could be quelled. My father was in Hong Kong at the time and saw the first DNA sequence of the virus. ""The doctors treating people were not going home at night. They were protecting their families,"" he recalls.People in Asia learnt from Sars. They learnt how viruses spread and how to protect yourself and others through good hygiene and social distancing.They learnt how to adjust their lives in ways we in the West have not had to do in living memory. It's not that we can't do it but we are not practised.If you listen to radio interviews with ordinary people in lockdown areas of Asia, you tend not to hear moaning, but the reassuring voices of people getting by in difficult circumstances. Stories of neighbours helping each other. Pride in doctors and nurses. And praise for the authorities who are keeping essential services running with a skeleton staff.At the peak of the outbreak in Wuhan, residents shouted encouragement to each other at night from their apartment windows, boosting the city's morale. Then yesterday, from Turin to Naples, Italians started singing to each other from their balconies.This is not science, but as the UK Government moves forward it might point its behavioural scientists in the direction of some of these more positive observations.It is no doubt true, as the nudge theorists hold, that much human behaviour is instinctive rather than rational, but we are all capable of sustained positive change given the right circumstances and leadership.As the epidemic closes in on us in Britain, it is a fact that the lives of many of our parents and grandparents will be in peril. And when the dust settles in six to 12 months time and league tables of fatality rates appear we will know how well we responded.There are many reasons why we may not end up at the top of that list but let's make sure it is not because we didn't ask enough of ourselves as a nation.",Newspaper

Donald Trump's physician, Sean Conley, has confirmed the US president does not have Covid-19. Earlier on Saturday, vice-president Mike Pence announced that the country's European travel ban would be extended to the UK and Ireland from midnight on Monday (eastern standard time).•NHS and private hospitals join forces to fight coronavirus. The NHS is to form an unprecedented partnership with the private health sector this week in an emergency plan to combat the Covid-19 crisis, amid fears the UK's publicly-funded hospitals will be unable to cope with the number of coronavirus patients.•A group of more than 240 UK scientists have denounced the government's plan to achieve ""herd immunity"" by delaying measures to prevent the virus spreading. The group said that enforcing social distancing now could save ""thousands of lives"".•The Spanish government has formally declared a state of emergency over the coronavirus, placing the country in lockdown and ordering people to stay at home for the next two weeks unless they have to buy food or medicine or go to work or hospital. The measures are set to come into effect on Monday morning and follows in the example set by France hours earlier, which announced the closure all public places ""non-essential"" from midnight on Saturday.•Spanish PM's wife tests positive for coronavirus. The Spanish government announced that the prime minister's wife, Begoña Gómez, has tested positive for the coronavirus. Both Gomez and her husband, Pedro Sánchez, are doing well and remain at their official residence in Madrid, the Moncloa palace, the government said in a statement.•Israel proposes uses anti-terrorism tracking tech. Israel has - like France and Spain - announced a partial closure of the country, shutting down hotels, cafes, restaurants, cinemas, theatres and malls. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu added that he hopes to deploy anti-terrorism tracking technology to locate people who have been in contact with those carrying the virus. He said he had requested Justice Ministry approval because such measures could infringe patients' privacy.""The enemy is invisible, but we must locate it,"" Netanyahu said.•Colombia closes border with Venezuela and Ecuador bans foreigners. Colombia overnight closed its border with Venezuela in order to stem the spread of Covid-19 in the South American nation. The move to shut the border came overnight, after Venezuela confirmed its first two cases of Covid-19 on Friday morning. Colombia currently has 22 confirmed cases of Covid-19, but its government appears to view Venezuela - with fewer cases - as a possible centre of an outbreak in Latin America. Meanwhile, Ecuador announced it would ban foreigners from entering the country by land, sea or air. Citizens and residents will be able to enter until Monday, after which they will also face restrictions. Gatherings larger than 30 people have also been banned.•Libya's Tripoli-based Government of National Accord has declared a state of emergency over the coronavirus and will close all air and sea ports from Monday, prime minister Fayez al-Serraj said on Saturday. Libya, split for years between rival governments that have been fighting a war for nearly a year, lacks adequate isolation and other facilities to combat the virus, the head of its disease control centre told Reuters on Thursday.•Rwanda, Seychelles and Central African Republic confirmed their first coronavirus cases on Saturday - bringing the total number of African countries that have reported positive tests for the virus to 23. Sudan has ordered the closure of schools and universities for one month from Saturday to stop the spread of coronavirus, a statement from the prime minister's office said. While Morocco has banned flight to and from as many as 25 countries.•Global number of confirmed cases stands at 156,098, with 5,819 deaths. As of today 72,621 people have recovered, according to Johns Hopkins University.

Hyperinflation is rampant, with shortages in basic foodstuffs and medical supplies already a daily reality. Around 1.4 million of those that have left have arrived to Colombia, which shares a 1,378-mile border with Venezuela.Authorities estimate as many as 40,000 people cross the border every day, the majority of which buy supplies - medicines and food staples - and return home.The move to shut the border came overnight, after Venezuela confirmed its first two cases of Covid-19 on Friday morning.The two countries broke diplomatic relations when Colombia ceased to recognise its embattled leader, Nicolás Maduro, as the country's legitimate president in early 2019, as part of an ongoing US-led coalition to oust him from office. Analysts say that will hamper coordination to contain a virus that does not respect borders.Others worry that the closure will force desperate Venezuelans to cross informally, putting them at risk of armed groups operating along the border. ""Colombia's overnight decision to 'close' its porous border with Venezuela won't stop the flow of people,"" tweeted Geoff Ramsey, a Venezuela expert at the Washington Office on Latin America. ""But it will force them to rely more on informal crossings where they'll be more vulnerable to exploitation and abuse.""Colombia currently has 22 confirmed cases of Covid-19, but its government appears to view Venezuela - with fewer cases - as a possible centre of an outbreak in Latin America. Iván Duque Márquez, Colombia's president, described the closure in a statement as ""a measure of protection ahead of the situation unfolding in [Venezuela].""Márquez also announced overnight a ban on travellers who have been in Europe or Asia in the last 14 days, with the exceptions of Colombian citizens and residents.All measures are expected to last until 30 May.Updated at 5.41pm GMT5.21pm GMTIn the UK, a newborn baby tested positive for coronavirus at a north London hospital earlier today. The child's mother, who was taken to a north London hospital days before the birth with suspected pneumonia, has also caught the virus.Richard Tedder, visiting professor in medical virology, Imperial College London, said this raises ""concerns about the potential ways in which this transmission may have occurred"".He told PA Media:It is important to say at this point in time that the detection of Covid-19 nucleic acid on the sample from the child does not necessarily mean that the child was infected. It could well have come from the mother at the time of delivery, further follow-up of the infant will clarify whether or not the infant is infected.Previous data from colleagues in China, published in the journal The Lancet, albeit on a small number of mother and infant pairs, did not show infection in any of the infants at the time of birth. Neither did sampling of breast milk immediately after birth contain detectable virus. Thus, the UK observation of a possible neonatal transmission is unexpected and needs further confirmation.The question of risk to a newly born child being nursed by a mother who is known to be infected is a matter that will need careful consideration. The absence of detectable virus in breast milk would appear to reduce the risk of breastfeeding however the close, intimate and entirely understandable contact between a mother and her baby will raise questions about how best to care for them. Compounding this too is the lack of knowledge of the clinical outcome of neonatal infection, should this actually occur.5.14pm GMTItaly's coronavirus death toll rose to 1,441 from 1,266 on Friday, according to official data. The number of confirmed cases has risen to 21,157 from 17,660 over the same period. 5.04pm GMTThe filming in Mexico of a big budget Steven Spielberg-produced Amazon mini-series, starring Spanish actor Javier Bardem, has been suspended due to concerns about the coronavirus, according to a letter sent to cast and crew on Friday and seen by Reuters.The production entitled Mexica, which centers on the Spanish conquest of the Aztecs, began filming two weeks ago on location in Mexico City. Mexico has so far confirmed 26 cases of coronavirus.Only a skeletal wrap crew will continue working through next week, and cast and crew were informed that production might resume in December depending on how the public health crisis develops.The project's budget is believed to be tens of millions of dollars, and dozens of local contractors will be affected by the suspension.

102,"Shock and awe is a superficial coronavirus cure;Seeking herd immunity is not a satisfying quick fix, but it does acknowledge that this will be a long war","March 14, 2020 Saturday",International,The Daily Telegraph (London),821,821,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,HARRY DE QUETTEVILLE,"Shock and awe is a superficial coronavirus cureSeeking herd immunity is not a satisfying quick fix, but it does acknowledge that this will be a long war","I went to the Tutankhamun exhibition yesterday. It was a blockbuster with no queues, no jostling to catch a glimpse of the treasures of Ancient Egypt. Quiet as the boy-pharaoh's grave. ""Like the country's on a war footing,"" someone said behind me. And indeed, as we left, there was an elderly chap on the way in, complete with gas mask.Which war, though, is this? What kind of enemy is the coronavirus? For in the experience of most Britons alive today, war is something that happens elsewhere, and then is over quickly. Ousting the Taliban in Afghanistan in 2001 took just over two months. Removing Saddam about half that. All it took was overwhelming firepower and a swift declaration of ""Mission accomplished"". Easy.We are being disabused of the first part of this comforting delusion now. Coronavirus was always coming to these shores in a big way. And yet, until this week, we couldn't quite take it seriously. These things happen abroad, don't they? It even says so on the tin: Mers, the last coronavirus to scare the living daylights out of health authorities, stood for Middle East respiratory syndrome. When this one was thriving close by in Italy, I still heard it said, and am sure you did, too: ""Well, that's Italian organisation for you."" Such careless talk will have cost lives here.None the less, somehow we are still clinging to part two of our contemporary conflict gospel: that this war will be quick.It is easy to see why. From China come pictures of business not quite as usual but not far off, the number of new cases dipping towards zero even as ours spike. Italy has, meanwhile, clasped the disease in an iron grip. From Milan to Palermo there will be many now looking at our approach and shaking their own heads with scorn: ""The British! Doing nothing. E incredibile!!"" We can beat this virus, the news from beyond the Channel proclaims. The right measures, draconian as they may seem, can put this genie back in its bottle.Well, that may be right, for we must admit that every nation is experimenting. Every nation is seeking to deliver the best outcome for its citizens. But delivering the best is not the same as hoping for the best.And as it stands, acting as though the coronavirus will somehow be a one-off episode, like an air-raid that we can wait out in our bunkers, is indeed hoping for the best.Far more likely is that coronavirus will be with us for years, perhaps forever, and that consequently the best way of dealing with it is to build up increasing levels of resistance in the population. In this theory, herding everyone into isolation is not dealing with the problem so much as storing it up for another day - until it emerges to strike a people who have lost their fear of the disease without acquiring immunity to it.This, surely, is the nightmare scenario, where shock and awe only superficially does the job, where Mission Accomplished means nothing of the sort, and subsequent, understandable, complacency leads to catastrophe.On the battlefield, that was the case in Afghanistan after 2001, and Iraq in 2003. Indeed, as the mourning relatives of Lance Corporal Brodie Gillon, killed north of Baghdad on Thursday, would remind us, those swift wars of two decades ago are still claiming lives www.today.No. As Graham Medley, from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, told Newsnight this week, it is the Blitz spirit that is required. A spirit of endurance, and one that comes from the top. An attitude which, more than three years - years! - after the declaration of the Second World War, saw Churchill declare ""not the end... not even the beginning of the end. But, perhaps, the end of the beginning.""How best to prepare for such a long haul? How should the Government best nudge our behaviour from the short-termism of today to the longtermism of old? It will not be easy. Because although the long campaign will be gentler - easier on the NHS and on supply chains while resistance gradually builds among the population - it will be more grating, more moralesapping.What we all, around the world, secretly want to hear is that life will shortly return to normal. Nothing will be as telling as whether or not governments give in to that desire.It is their job not to.Those Beijing authorities now confidently claiming corona is beaten are the same authorities who hid the outbreak in the first place. Doubtless Tehran will declare the virus crushed while the secretly dug mass graves are still fresh.The alternative attitude, of professional realism to foster herd immunity, seems to be that of the British Government. It does not offer a quick, satisfying, fix, or even the prospect of a quick fix. And that can feel gloomy. But it would be a mistake to confuse gloomy with halfwitted. And half-witted not to see that promises of the quick fix are the gloomiest promises of all.FOLLOW Harry de Quetteville on Twitter @harrydq; read more at www.telegraph.co.uk/opinion",Newspaper
103,The Government wants us to get ill - just not too ill;Official policy on Covid-19 is just a series of educated guesses. We may not know for years if it's right,"March 14, 2020 Saturday",International,The Daily Telegraph (London),1126,1126,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,JULIET SAMUEL,The Government wants us to get ill - just not too illOfficial policy on Covid-19 is just a series of educated guesses. We may not know for years if it's right,"It is footage that has become infamous from the coronavirus epidemic in Wuhan: residents waking up to find metal bars welded across their doors by police, sealing them into their homes until authorities decide to let them out. China has been widely praised for its Herculean containment effort. It seems to have worked. But alongside the enormous mobilisation of resources and public spirit, there was a hard edge to Beijing's method.When our Government says that it cannot contain the spread of coronavirus, it is saying, essentially, that it is either not willing or able to arm the cops with welding torches and that, without them, it cannot keep the population under control for long enough. A vaccine is probably a year to 18 months away. So, No10 says, this is a marathon, not a sprint.This is one of many assumptions underlying Britain's anomalous approach to the epidemic. The Government is taking criticism from all sides for not falling into line with other European and Asian countries, many of which have shut down schools, moved early to ban large gatherings and, in some cases, made it illegal for anyone to leave their home without a critical reason. But the bet in London is that countries taking draconian measures early in their infection cycle are going to run out of steam and leave themselves with no tools to manage later resurgences.Despite examples of containment elsewhere, the Government believes that the epidemic is now so widespread across the world that permanent containment is impossible. The management of it, therefore, is all about timing. If the UK can get into an equilibrium in which the epidemic does not exceed a certain rate of growth, the health system might have a chance of coping.Currently, however, infection is speeding up rapidly. The British gamble seems to be that the speed can be fine-tuned. If it starts to overwhelm the NHS's capacity, other measures, like stricter isolation advice, will kick in to slow it down. As this process continues, the idea is that the least vulnerable people get the disease and recover, ultimately developing enough immunity to protect the elderly and ill. At that point, isolation measures can be eased.If this sounds like a risky operation, it's because it is. In fact, it looks rather like trying to catch the surf using a broken board and a spreadsheet of sporadic data about the ocean floor and the shape and speed of the incoming wave. This makes one other element of the strategy absolutely critical. The Government needs to monitor the epidemic with monomaniacal focus. If its modelling assumptions about the virus's characteristics, the behaviour of the population or the capacity of the health service start to look dodgy, it needs to change tack at lightning www.speed.UK data collection so far has, by all accounts, been excellent, which should give us a bit of confidence.The need for nimble policy is one possible reason for laying off the welding torch and travel bans. China is close to declaring victory, with President Xi Jinping visiting Wuhan recently to take credit for the work of the country's scientists and health workers. State propaganda has lauded the inimitable People's Leader, comparing him to a fantastical ""sea-stabilising holy cudgel"" from a classic Chinese novel. This may not leave a lot of room for changing approach if a second wave of infection hits as China begins to lift restrictions.The UK's approach, however, has its own potentially huge flaws. The most salient is the assumption that it is neither possible nor desirable to stop the epidemic completely. The behavioural science underlying the claim that you cannot get people to stay away from each other for six months or a year is an obvious weak point. Given that this situation is unprecedented in the modern era, how on earth do these behavioural ""scientists"" know?What's more, they seem to be assuming that the Government does not have hard power at its disposal. If it drew on its emergency powers, flooded cities with police drones and threatened jail time for wanderers, we would probably learn to stay put pretty quickly. So what the Prime Minister really means, when he worries about a mood of uncooperative ""crisis fatigue"" setting in, is that the danger from the virus is not great enough to warrant such a major suspension of liberty.This relies on a series of educated guesses. Chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance has made several statements about the virus that other scientists argue are highly uncertain. He has said that it is likely to become endemic, that the population needs to develop ""herd immunity"" to protect us from recurrent waves of illness each year and that the current fatality rate is around one per cent. These statements are no doubt based on good evidence, but could still be wrong.For one thing, Singapore, China and South Korea seem to demonstrate that the spread isn't inevitable. The many deaths we are being told to expect may be avoidable. Even if containment is impossible and the virus recurs, it may have changed form so much that ""herd immunity"" does not protect us. And the current fatality rate seems to vary wildly.In South Korea, looking just at ""completed"" infections, 11 per cent of patients have died and 89 per cent have recovered, whereas in Italy, one person has died for every one that has recovered. The difference could be explained by the quality of care (Korea has many more ventilators), age, underlying health or some other factor. As with the virus's long-term effects, we just don't know.Nor can Government scientists be certain about the epidemic's peculiar features. They think it spreads most within clusters, such as family or church groups, unlike seasonal flu, which spreads in a reasonably linear way across clusters. This means that an infected person on a train is not as much of an obvious infection risk with Covid-19 as with normal flu, and this is the sort of observation that underlies the Government's models and its timeline. But why the new virus spreads this way, scientists cannot say. That makes it hard to assume it will behave in the way the models predict.The truth is that it will be years before we know who has called it right. A strategy is not right or wrong based on how many governments adopt it. It is nothing more than a live experiment. All we can do is hope that Britain's leaders and scientists are getting it right given the nature of the epidemic here and the resources at their disposal. In the meantime, we can all at least do something: wash, wash, wash our hands.FOLLOW Juliet Samuel on Twitter @CitySamuel; read more at www.telegraph.co.uk/opinion'The many deaths we are being told to expect may be avoidable...

104,DAN HODGES: We have a new British motto: Panic And Snatch Toilet Rolls,"March 14, 2020 Saturday",International,MailOnline,1165,1165,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,Dan Hodges For The Mail On Sunday,DAN HODGES: We have a new British motto: Panic And Snatch Toilet Rolls,"The military are mobilising. Preparing for the deployment of Army units to protect hospitals, supermarkets and other vital facilities.Not from a hostile invading force, or terrorist fanatics. But from the British people, in the event the coronavirus emergency starts to spiral out of control.It sounds like something out of science-fiction film. Or a rehash of one of the more apocalyptic Project Fear scenarios from the Brexit debate.But it's not a film, or a political construct. Coronavirus is real. It has no political affiliation. And unless we as a nation realise that, and start to get a grip, a lot of people are going to die.Until a couple of weeks ago, our unofficial national motto was Keep Calm And Carry On. This morning it has become Panic And Snatch The Toilet Roll.Never mind the fact many of our fellow citizens with serious existing medical conditions need the products being greedily and selfishly hoovered from the shelves. Ignore the most vulnerable in society, who don't have the luxury of investing a month's food bill on a single shop in order to 'be prepared'.'I think it is very, very important that people should behave responsibly and think about others,' Boris Johnson told the nation on Monday. But the hard truth is there are too many of us not thinking of others. Or even thinking at all.Partly that's because we are trying to fight the virus while still fighting a vicious culture war. As the Chief Scientific Adviser and Chief Medical Officer were calmly and patiently setting out the rationale for the Government's response to the crisis, journalist Carole Cadwalladr was taking to Twitter to inform her 460,000 followers: 'We voted Vote Leave into power knowing they'd broken law, lied and refused to answer questions on their conduct. And now the fate of our nation rests on trusting that they are making critical decisions in accountable and transparent ways based on best possible info.Can you 'cheat' coronavirus? Is that the strategy? Can it be rigged? Like, say, an election?'No, it's not the strategy. And Cadwalladr knows it. But for some, dying in the ditch over Brexit still has to take precedence over trying to save the lives of those threatened by coronavirus.Another problem is however fast the virus is spreading, that's nothing when compared to the way malicious misinformation about Covid-19 is surging across social media.Over the past week, three naked lies about the Government's response were able to flourish virtually unchecked.The first was a video which purported to show Boris claiming his plan was to 'take it on the chin' and let Britain bear the brunt of the virus in order to protect the economy. It had been deliberately doctored, with the section in which he explained he had rejected that option purposely edited out.But it ran for days. Indeed, it's still running.The second was the claim a shadowy 'nudge unit' of behavioural scientists - egged on by the No 10 super-forecasters - was directing the response of Ministers, to the exclusion of advice from clinical experts. But as a Department of Health source explained: 'What people don't understand is behavioural science is a key part of epidemiology.It's built in. It's not a case of behaviouralists versus scientists. Doctors and clinicians understand how people react to the spread of diseases, and measures to contain that spread, and it all forms part of our modelling.'The most pernicious lie of all was the claim over 'herd immunity'. Or, to be more blunt, the claim we are about to be subjected to a Government-sponsored genocide of the old and sick.Chief Scientific Adviser Sir Patrick Vallance had stated that in order to finally defeat the virus, 60 per cent of the UK population would need to contract the disease at some stage, building up sufficient natural biological protection to protect the more vulnerable members of society.This was immediately seized upon and spun as an attempt by the Government to perpetuate a new form of natural selection.Rebecca Long Bailey's media team took to social media to claim: 'With the current mortality rate, that's 780,000 deaths. Which amounts to almost twice the number of British civilian and military casualties in World War Two.'But as a No 10 official explained for the umpteenth time: 'Our objective is not to secure herd immunity. Our objective is to flatten the curve of the virus's spread to ensure the NHS and other services retain the capacity to protect the most vulnerable patients. As the epidemic develops, a lot of people will have minor symptoms, and hopefully begin to develop natural immunity. That's a good thing. But it won't help us during the course of this virus cycle. It will only help contain future outbreaks.'The danger we face as a nation is not that we will be killed by a misguided policy on herd immunity. What is imperilling us is a herd mentality. A stampede away from facts and truth towards biases and prejudices embedded by years of Brexit trench-warfare.This is not a game. Coronavirus is not 'like the flu'. As Boris said, we are facing the worst public health crisis in a generation. And that crisis cannot be overcome by the casual transmission of lies and half-truths and fake news that will in their own way prove as lethal as the transmission of the virus itself.Yes, we live in a democracy. Yes, it's right that our leaders are challenged. But in the middle of a global pandemic, we cannot have them usurped.We have a constitutionally elected Prime Minister. His Chief Medical Officer Chris Whitty is a former practising consultant at UCLH and the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. He was Chief Scientific Adviser and Director of Research at the Department of International Development, where he helped tackle the Ebola outbreak in Sierra Leone.Sir Patrick is a former professor at UCL Medical School, and former head of research and development at GlaxoSmithKline, where he developed new medicines for combating cancer, asthma and HIV.Who should we be looking to at this moment of global crisis? Men like that? Or men with the clinical and scientific foresight of Watford football manager Nigel Pearson, who popped up on Thursday to declare: 'I don't think we had any great leadership last night... I was totally underwhelmed by the lack of leadership and clear message.'Imagine you are on a plane. Suddenly the passenger in the seat next to you starts screaming that the pilot is flying erratically.Do you keep faith with that pilot? Or do you force your way into the cockpit and land the plane yourself?We have a PM who is being honest about the challenges we face as a nation, and open about the strategy required to meet them. He is being guided by experts who are honour bound to protect the health and wellbeing of the public. They are implementing a strategy that has been modelled and refined and rehearsed over several decades.Now is the time for Britain to put its collective faith in them.If for no other reason than we have no other choice.

They then recover and have an immunity to it.When enough people have this immunity it eventually limits the spread of the virus as it has fewer places to go.This strategy is different from China, Korea, Italy and Singapore where they have tried to stop the virus spreading in a determined bid to suppress the epidemic rather than accept that it will inevitably spread.Ian Donald, who worked atUniversity of Liverpool's Institute of Population Health Sciences, said: ""The government strategy on coronavirus is more refined than those used in other countries and potentially very effective. But it is also riskier and based on a number of assumptions.""They need to be correct, and the measures they introduce need to work when they are supposed to.""A UK starting assumption is that a high number of the population will inevitably get infected whatever is done - up to 80%. As you can't stop it, so it is best to manage it.Coronavirus super-spreaders: What are they and how do they transmit the virus""There are limited health resources so the aim is to manage the flow of the seriously ill to these.""The Italian model the aims to stop infection. The UK's wants infection but of particular categories of people.""The aim of the UK is to have as many lower risk people infected as possible.""Immune people cannot infect others; the more there are the lower the risk of infection. That's herd immunity.""Based on this idea, at the moment the government wants people to get infected, up until hospitals begin to reach capacity. At that they want to reduce, but not stop infection rate.""Ideally they balance it so the numbers entering hospital equal the number leaving. That balance is the big risk.""All the time people are being treated, other mildly ill people are recovering and the population grows a higher percent of immune people who can't infect. They can also return to work and keep things going normally - and go to the pubs.""The risk is being able to accurately manage infection flow relative to health case resources. Data on infection rates needs to be accurate, the measures they introduce need to work and at the time they want them to and to the degree they want, or the system is overwhelmed.Donald""Schools: Kids generally won't get very ill, so the government can use them as a tool to infect others when you want to increase infection. When you need to slow infection, that tap can be turned off - at that point they close the schools. Politically risky for them to say this.""The same for large scale events - stop them when you want to slow infection rates; turn another tap off. This means schools etc are closed for a shorter period and disruption generally is therefore for a shorter period, AND with a growing immune population. This is sustainable.""After a while most of the population is immune, the seriously ill have all received treatment and the country is resistant. The more vulnerable are then less at risk. This is the end state the government is aiming for and could achieve.""But a key issue during this process is protection of those for whom the virus is fatal. It's not clear the full measures there are to protect those people. It assumes they can measure infection, that their behavioural expectations are met - people do what they think they will.UK coronavirus death toll almost doubles in a day as 10 more patients die""The Italian (and others) strategy is to stop as much infection as possible - or all infection. This is appealing, but then what? The restrictions are not sustainable for months. So they will need to be relaxed. But that will lead to reemergence of infections.""Then rates will then start to climb again. So they will have to reintroduce the restrictions each time infection rates rise. That is not a sustainable model and takes much longer to achieve the goal of a largely immune population with low risk of infection of the vulnerable.""As the government tries to achieve equilibrium between hospitalisations and infections, more interventions will appear. It's perhaps why there are at the moment few public information films on staying at home. They are treading a tight path, but possibly a sensible one.""This is probably the best strategy, but they should explain it more clearly. It relies on a lot of assumptions, so it would be good to know what they are - especially behavioural. Most encouraging, it's way too clever for Boris Johnson to have had any role in developing.""Other experts have criticised the UK's strategy as they are not following World Health Organisation advice.ProfSome claim it is a ""survival of the fittest"" strategy that leaves vulnerable groups - such as the elderly, the infirm and those with weakened immune systems - at much greater risk.Anthony Costello, the former director at the World Health Organisation, professor of international child health and director of the University College London Institute for Global Health, took to Twitter to take issue with the ""herd immunity"" plan.He said: ""Unlike all other countries, the UK strategy aims to build herd immunity by allowing the steady spread of Covid-19.""The government argue it will block a second peak in several months time. Here are eight questions about this herd immunity strategy.Coronavirus in Scotland LIVE as 121 confirmed cases and first person dies""1. Will it impair efforts to restrict the immediate epidemic, and cause more infections and deaths in the near term? Evidence suggests people shed virus early, and those without symptoms may cause substantial spread. This argues for policies against mass gatherings, for school closures, and for strict national and local measures for social distancing.""2. Will it weaken containment systems (testing, screening, radiography, isolation)? China quickly built a robust nation-wide system of mobilised communities/workers for identifying cases promptly, isolating contacts and treating vulnerable people promptly to contain the outbreak.""3. Does coronavirus cause strong herd immunity or is it like flu where new strains emerge each year needing repeat vaccines? We have much to learn about Co-V immune responses.""4. Doesn't this herd immunity strategy conflict with WHO Policy? After the announcement of this being a pandemic, Dr Tedros, Director General WHO, said: ""The idea that countries should shift from containment to mitigation is wrong and dangerous.Top news stories today""5. Shouldn't we wait to see the China situation? They've contained the epidemic after 7 weeks of intense national effort. Will their strengthened systems not contain outbreaks quickly? What is their herd immunity? We don't have serology available yet? It might be substantial.""6. Without an all-out national mobilisation plan for social distancing, are the UK government behavioural and nudge strategies really evidence-based to flatten the peak? Or simply based on models?""7. On the precautionary principle shouldn't we go all-out to snuff this UK epidemic out, with national mobilisation at all levels, using all possible preventive measures (whether evidence is strong, uncertain or weak) and worry about herd immunity when we have more evidence?""8. Vaccines are a safer way to develop herd immunity, without the risks associated with the disease itself. Is it ethical to adopt a policy that threatens immediate casualties on the basis of an uncertain future benefit?""The debate over the UK strategy for dealing with the virus comes as 36 new cases wereconfirmed in Scotlandon Saturday, bringing the total number of patients now diagnosed to 121.Highland region has its first confirmed case, as the Glasgow total rises by 10 to 31.Ten more patients have died in England after testing positive for Covid-19, bringing thecoronavirusdeath toll to 21 in the UK.A number of the patients, who were over 60, had underlying health conditions, NHS England said.It comes as the Department of Health revealed 1,140 have now tested positive for the virus in the UK.",Newspaper; Web Publication
107,Johnson attempts to keep UK open for business;Politics. Medical advice ; PM believes other countries taking draconian action now will be vulnerable later,"March 14, 2020 Saturday",International,"Financial Times (London, England)",921,921,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,"GEORGE PARKER, CLIVE COOKSON ;SEBASTIAN PAYNE",Johnson attempts to keep UK open for businessPolitics. Medical advice ; PM believes other countries taking draconian action now will be vulnerable later,"Boris Johnson remarked in 2007 that the true hero of the movie Jaws was the ""laudable"" mayor Larry Vaughn, who kept his seaside town open for business in spite of apparent hysteria around a series of shark attacks.""A gigantic fish is eating all your constituents and he decides to keep the beach open,"" the UK prime minister told a business audience. ""It turned out , while around the world the shutters are being put up.The prime minister, who said this week that Britain was facing ""the greatest public health crisis for a generation"", is facing criticism from some polihe was wrong. But it remains that he was heroically right in principle.""Mr Johnson, on the advice of his medical and scientific advisers, is trying to keep Britain open for business -- at least for now - - in the face of coronavirusticians and scientists for failing to act sufficiently swiftly or decisively.But Mr Johnson's stance has been based on an acceptance that the disease will spread widely in society: he wants to flatten its peak and delay the worst of the crisis until the summer.While some countries, such as Singapore or Hong Kong, have tried to stamp out the disease, Patrick Vallance, Mr Johnson's chief scientific adviser, says it is actually desirable to build up ""herd immunity"" to protect the country in the longer term.""About 60 per cent is the sort of figure you need to get herd immunity,"" Sir Patrick said. That suggests up to 40m people might contract the disease under the government's plan. As Mr Johnson concedes, many loved ones will die.Since mid-February, as the virus morphed from a health issue into a national crisis, the prime minister's chief adviser, Dominic Cummings, has helped to shape Mr Johnson's approach, relying on scientific experts and communicating through simple messaging. Mr Cummings has expressed interest in health and science. ""I am particularly interested in public health and the field of epidemiology,"" he wrote in 2016.Both of the government's three-word mantras came out of focus groups, a favoured tool of Mr Cummings. Following his success with ""take back control"" in the 2016 Brexit referendum and ""get Brexit done"" in the 2019 election, two slogans underpin its strategy: ""wash your hands"" and ""stay at home"".Mr Johnson and his scientific advisers hope to manage the epidemic by ""flattening the curve"" of infection and delaying the peak until the summer when the health service will face less seasonal pressure.Then - or so the theory goes - enough people will have acquired resistance to Covid-19 to avoid a second wave of disease next autumn or winter. Downing Street believes that other countries that have taken draconian action now will be vulnerable later.The strategy depends on building up ""herd immunity"" in the population. If a high enough proportion has become resistant through infection, then the virus will not have enough new people to infect and the epidemic will burn out.But the idea is not scientifically proven to work for this new virus, whose long-term effect on the immune system is unknown. As Rupert Beale, head of the Cell Biology of Infection Laboratory at London's Francis Crick Institute, put it: ""The problem is we don't know if 'herd immunity' can be achieved. Other coronaviruses can reinfect a few months down the line. We don't know yet for Covid-19.""Every medical expert says that no one will be able to assess the strength and duration of the human immune response to Covid-19 until people who have recovered from the disease have been studied for months. But Prof Hunter, a communicable diseases specialist, said: ""I will go out on a limb and suggest the immunity will not last for a lifetime but will last for more than a few months - possibly two or three years.""Illustrating the range of medical opinion, Martin Hibberd, professor of emerging infectious disease, London School of Hygiene &Tropical Medicine, is more optimistic. ""The evidence is increasingly convincing that infection with [Covid-19] leads to an antibody response that is protective,"" he said.""Most likely this protection is for life, although we need more evidence to be sure of this; people who have recovered are unlikely to be infected again.""Seasonal factors will also help the strategy of flattening and delaying the peak of the epidemic until the weather is warmer. Not only are flu and other respiratory viruses less prevalent in summer but many experts believe Covid-19 will behave in a similar way.The Institute of Human Virology at the University of Maryland has published research suggesting Covid-19 thrives best when average temperatures are between 5C and 11C, as in a mild European winter.The scientific advice governments consult to decide on policy includes not just public health but behavioural science. The UK and other governments have cited a concern that people may stop complying with a policy of isolation if it goes on for a long time.It is a well-founded concern, according to academics. ""My reading of the evidence is that adherence to the isolation policy dwindles over time,"" said Susan Michie, professor of health psychology at University College London. ""We know that psychological problems can arise in long-term isolation. People get bored and frustrated and feel lonely.""Mr Johnson and his pro-Brexit allies were notoriously prickly about the advice of ""experts"" at the time of the 2016 referendum; the prime minister is now taking a big political risk by backing them to the hilt on coronavirus.

Corbyn demands increase in sick pay as part of emergency Covid-19 law                    Emergency laws to help tackle the spread of coronavirus should dramatically increase sick pay and protections for workers in the gig economy, Jeremy Corbyn said.In a letter to Prime Minister Boris Johnson ahead of the expected publication of the legislation which will be fast tracked through Parliament, the Labour leader also called for measures to allow the deferral of rent and mortgage payments for people who cannot work.Mr Corbyn also called for Mr Johnson to be more transparent about the ""scientific and behavioural evidence and modelling"" that was guiding the Government's response to the Covid-19 outbreak.Calling for a meeting with the Prime Minister, Mr Corbyn said: ""This crisis demands political as well as scientific judgments and clearer public communication based on greater transparency of scientific and behavioural evidence and modelling than has been provided to date.""The public are rightly seeking a much higher level of explanation and transparency as to the course of action being taken, including whether more far-reaching measures, as taken in other comparable states, could be necessary.""Mr Corbyn called for the legislation to include a financial package to protect and support the most vulnerable and for the Bill to be subject to an equality impact assessment.He called for the £94.25 a week statutory sick pay to be be raised in line with the amounts paid in other European countries with similar economies.Other measures called for by Mr Corbyn include full sick pay and lost earnings protection for all workers, no matter what form of employment they have, during self-isolation or illness.He also called on ministers to remove the requirement to present for Universal Credit interviews in all cases, immediately suspend sanctions and reduce the waiting time of five weeks for the first payment of the benefit.Mr Corbyn also demanded support for local authorities working with food banks in the purchase and distribution of supplies.""In the light of the scale of the crisis, the Government should bring forward a package of emergency financial security measures to give people the security and confidence they need to follow public health advice as part of our collective national endeavour,"" he said.",Web Publication

It is the first time in this parliament that support for the government has appeared to waver.Gordon Brown, the former Labour prime minister, said yesterday that ""fears are still growing for our safety. For all the brilliance of Britain's medics, the government still seems behind the curve.""Yesterday, for the first time, a Briton who has died from the Covid-19 virus was named. Kimberley Finlayson, 53, a mother of four, fell ill during a holiday in Bali. She is understood to have had underlying health conditions.Scotland reported its first coronavirus death yesterday. The person was not named but is also believed to have had other illnesses.The rising death toll and news of schisms at the top of government over Britain's approach to the outbreak have added to growing nervousness about the virus. In the latest polling 38 per cent of Britons now say that they are scared by the possibility of catching it, compared with 24 per cent only a fortnight ago.Public health messages about improving personal hygiene appear to have hit home. Sixty-one per cent of people say that they now wash their hands frequently and use hand sanitiser, up from 35 per cent at the start of the month, according to a YouGov poll of 2287 adults taken on Thursday and Friday.The proportion of people working from home has already doubled from 2 per cent to 4 per cent, but support for avoiding going in to work has surged. Sixty-six per cent of people now want the government to encourage more remote working, up from 45 per cent two weeks ago.Boris Johnson still has the support of the majority of voters, with 55 per cent saying that the government is handling the crisis well. However, there is a partisan split: 78 per cent of Conservative voters are satisfied with the government's approach compared with only 37 per cent of Labour voters. Two weeks ago the figures were 71 per cent and 48 per cent.Although Mr Johnson's strategy still has cross-party support at Westminster, opposition parties started to voice frustration at a meeting with government officials yesterday. Concern was expressed over limited advice that has been given to elderly people and the role of behavioural scientists in advising against a lockdown, as well as over the discrepancies with other countries in the public health advice.Mr Johnson will spend the weekend calling world leaders in an effort to co-ordinate international action, despite having suggested that other countries' responses were driven more by politics than by scientific evidence.His spokesman said: ""The prime minister thinks that this crisis affects countries around the globe and it requires a global response.""Sir Patrick Vallance, the government's chief scientific adviser, has concluded that locking Britain down would result in more deaths than allowing a gradual peak in cases because the virus would bounce back later in the year. However, the government has yet to publish the detailed figures behind its reasoning.Jonathan Ashworth, the shadow health secretary, said: ""The public are understandably raising concerns about the government's strategy and why we appear to be out of kilter with other countries. As well as a delay stage the government need an 'explain' stage.I'm urging the government to offer greater clarity and publish more science so it can be better understood more widely, and peer-reviewed by experts in the field who are currently questioning our approach.""Liz Saville Roberts, leader of Plaid Cymru, said: ""Government has a duty to answer questions: first and foremost, why take a different approach to other countries across the world?"" Mr Johnson's spokesman said: ""We are very clear where we take our advice from. That is from the chief scientific adviser and the chief medical officer.""Our aim is to reduce the peak of the outbreak so the NHS will be in stronger state as the weather improves.""Mrs Finlayson, a publisher, died in Indonesia this week and her identity was made public yesterday. She had been on holiday in Bali with her husband, Ken, who has tested negative for the disease. They have four children who were not with them.Mrs Finlayson was a co-founder of FMC, the UK's biggest independent dental publisher. Yesterday a tribute was posted on www.dentistry.co.uk.""[Her] infectious passion, creativity and determination … will forever be written into the fabric of the business,"" it said. ""She championed her family with the same fierce pride with which she approached her business, and her four children were the centre of her world.""The Indonesian government confirmed Mrs Finlayson's death at a Sanglah hospital. She was admitted in a critical condition and suffered from lung disease and diabetes before she contracted the virus.Catherine Calderwood, chief medical officer for Scotland, said the first person to have died there had been an elderly person who had had underlying health conditions. The number of cases in Scotland increased to 85 yesterday. Leading article, page 27The sceptics who think there are better optionsJeremy Hunt, former health secretary The senior Conservative MP was the first big figure to criticise the government saying it was ""concerning"" that action such as cancelling large events was not being taken. Yesterday, he warned Boris Johnson that ""the clock is ticking"" to stop Britain becoming Italy.""The government is rightly following scientific advice - but even scientists have to make judgments and assumptions to inform their modelling,"" he wrote in the Evening Standard. ""There are other things the more successful countries have done that we are not doing. I hope they will be [announced] soon. 'Social distancing' - measures that stop people getting too close to each other - is the most important.""He cited travel restrictions, school closures and quarantining of the elderly in Singapore, Taiwan and Japan and said he was ""surprised"" that visits to care homes are still being allowed in Britain.Richard Horton, editor of The Lancet The most prominent medical critic has said that Britain is ""on the edge of an avoidable calamity"" citing desperate pleas from Italian doctors. ""The UK government - Matt Hancock and Boris Johnson - claim they are following the science. That is not true. The evidence is clear. The government is playing roulette with the public. This is a major error,"" he tweeted.""The UK is on the edge of an avoidable calamity. In addition to deaths preventable by more aggressive government action, it will be health workers who absorb the brunt of government complacency. I am not being alarmist. What is happening in Italy is real. Our government is not preparing us for that reality. We need immediate and assertive social distancing and closure policies. We need to prepare the NHS.""Martin Hibberd, professor of emerging infectious disease, London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine He expressed concerns about government planning that assume the virus cannot be stopped and instead aims for a controlled peak in the summer that gives the population herd immunity that protects the elderly. ""I do worry that making plans that assume such a large proportion of the population will become infected (and hopefully recovered and immune) may not be the very best that we can do,"" he said.""Another strategy might be to try to contain longer and perhaps long enough for a therapy to emerge that might allow some kind of treatment. This seems to be the strategy of countries such as Singapore … In this approach, extensive contact tracing and testing is able to rapidly identify new cases and fully isolate them. When put together with other social distancing measures, some confidence is gained that the pandemic can be more controllable and shops can remain open.""Gordon Brown, former prime minister Mr Brown has said that delays in testing in Britain ""sum up why fears are growing for our safety: the government still seems behind the curve"". He criticised ""national silos"" in fighting coronavirus and called for a more international response. ""National leaders still seem unable to apply or even absorb the hard-earned lesson that crises teach us, from the Sars epidemic to the financial meltdown: that global problems need global, not just local and national, responses,"" he wrote in The Guardian.""What dialogue has there been between the main global players - Presidents Xi, Trump, Moon of South Korea, and prime minister Conte of Italy - to benefit from each other's insights on travel restrictions, lockdowns and social distancing?"" What other countries are doing The UK's measures to tackle the coronavirus crisis differ significantly from other countries. Schools have not closed and the government has said that isolating the elderly population is not logical. Here is what other nations are doing.School closures Austria, Bulgaria, Denmark, France, Germany, Greece, Iran, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Norway, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Switzerland, the Czech Republic, Turkey, Ukraine, Venezuela.Mass gatherings France and the Netherlands have banned gathering of more than 100 people, as have Iceland, Switzerland, Austria, Hungary and Romania. In some countries outdoor gatherings are restricted to 500. The Czech Republic has banned meetings of more than 30 people, and all gatherings are banned in Belgium, Cyprus and Italy.Urban lockdown Wuhan in China was closed on January 23. In days the lockdown was extended to other cities, covering tens of millions of people.Sixty million people are in lockdown across Italy. Spain put 60,000 people in four towns on a mandatory lockdown yesterday and Iran said it would clear the streets nationwide within 24 hours so all citizens could be checked for the virus.Only a few thousand people are quarantined in South Korea.Sports events The English Premier League has suspended all fixtures until April 4. The Australian Grand Prix, scheduled for Sunday, is cancelled.The start of India's cricket premier league has been delayed.In the USA, the NBA basketball league has shut down for 30 days.The Masters golf tournament has been postponed and Saturday's Six Nations rugby match between Wales and Scotland has been called off.Cultural institutions The French culture ministry ordered state institutions to shut or restrict entry yesterday. The Louvre in Paris said it would close ""until further notice"" and the Palace of Versailles swiftly followed suit.In the US Broadway shows are suspended. Disneyland and Walt Disney World have shut.In the Netherlands universities, museums and theatres are shut.Travel restrictions President Trump has banned entry to the US to all travellers from mainland Europe for 30 days. Justin Trudeau has asked Canadians to avoid all non-essential travel.In Norway all people returning from abroad will be quarantined.Austria has suspended rail links and almost entirely closed its border with Italy, requiring medical certificates and health checks. It has also suspended air links with France, Spain and Switzerland.Turkey is halting flights from nine European countries including France, Germany and Spain from today.Connections with China, Iran, Iraq, Italy and South Korea were already banned.Venezuela has suspended all flights from Europe and Colombia.In the Philippines all travel in and out of the Manila metropolitan area is suspended until mid-April.All climbing permits for Mount Everest are cancelled in Nepal after China banned expeditions on the northern side.Following Slovakia, from Monday the Czech Republic will ban all foreigners without residency from entering and citizens from leaving.Malta has announced mandatory 14-day quarantine for everyone entering, as Israel has already imposed.",Newspaper
110,The pleasures and perils of precrastination,"March 14, 2020 Saturday",International,"Financial Times (London, England)",860,860,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,Tim Harford,The pleasures and perils of precrastination,"M any writers are notorious for leaving things to the last possible moment. Not I. I'm always itching to get started and, for that matter, to get finished. I would gladly have written this column on Monday, but in her wisdom my editor pointed out that in a busy week for news, it might be a good idea to wait.So I did, soothing myself by working on an episode of my podcast that I expect to be broadcast early in 2021. I can't help myself. In a world full of procrastinators, I am a precrastinator. I've been like this for a long time. At school, we had homework diaries in which the tasks for each subject and each day would be recorded. However slapdash my work, I itched for the moment of completion when I could score a bold line through each item. Even better, when every piece of work on a page was complete, I would tear out the page with relish. Sometimes, infuriatingly, some ugly outlier could not be completed promptly. It would sit there like an unsqueezed spot.One of my children has the lookingglass variant of this trait: while I am desperate to get to grips with unpleasant tasks, she is happy to postpone pleasant tasks indefinitely. To her, the highest form of gratification is gratification delayed. Christmas sweets are still in storage come Easter; her chocolate eggs last until her birthday in September; her birthday treats last until Christmas. Coronavirus be damned; we're in no danger of running out of candy.My daughter and I are both inverting the natural order of things, in which uncomfortable tasks are postponed in favour of easy pleasures.There are advantages in such behaviour, but traps as well. My daughter's siblings have realised that her chocolate hoard is a tempting target for sweettoothed marauders. And a new study from the behavioural economists Paola Giuliano and Paola Sapienza finds that very patient people are also less likely to be happy with their lives - possibly because they delay gratification so long that it never arrives at all.Meanwhile I am suffering the curse of the precrastinator in a world turned upside down by a virus. I regret my early purchases of cheap rail tickets, given that the meetings to which I intended to travel keep being cancelled. Booking Easter and summer holidays seemed far-sighted at the time; now it seems short-sighted. Or perhaps that is just hindsightedness.We precrastinators enjoy the benefits of better choice and cheaper reservations; in exchange, we have to be willing to accept that sometimes we will face painful conflicts between new opportunities and prior engagements. At times, we must abandon our plans.I'm an economist, so that's fine by me; I'm trained to believe the sunk-cost fallacy is a fallacy. While most humans tend to obsess about spending that cannot be recouped, throwing good money after bad, economists can sound almost Buddhist on the topic. Attachment to sunk costs is the root of suffering.The psychological study that coined the word ""precrastination"" was conducted by a team of psychologists led by David Rosenbaum. The experimenters showed people an alley, along which were distributed two heavy buckets. The experimental subjects were asked to walk down the alley, pick up a bucket and carry it to the far end.The total distance walked is the same either way, so the easiest way to do this task is to pick up the furthest bucket, minimising the distance over which one has to carry the load. However, the majority of people choose the nearest bucket, instinctively believing ""soonest started, soonest finished"".Psychologists who study old-fashioned procrastination argue that it's a behaviour designed to manage negative emotions: we avoid tasks that make us feel anxious. Surely we precrastinate for the same reason: to manage our worries. Here, the dread is not about the process of engaging with the task, but the anxiety of leaving a task unfinished. It's plausible that the feeling intensifies as the list of incomplete tasks grows. One suggestive study, by Francesca Gino and colleagues, looked at the emergency room of a hospital. As the department became busier, the doctors tended to favour the easier tasks - healthier patients with simpler problems - presumably because as they felt overwhelmed, they started looking for the quick wins.The researchers dubbed this behaviour ""completion bias"", and it seems closely related to precrastination. The busier and more stressed we get, the more desperately we look for opportunities to tick something off the to-do list. Nevertheless I shall keep precrastinating, and gladly. The advantages of getting stuck into a task are clear enough, so it is a question of managing the downsides. My to-do lists are structured to keep the important stuff in plain sight while the trivia is tucked below the fold. I try not to hold too tightly to my plans.I will admit that sometimes I go too far. A timeworn saying advises us to eat a live toad for breakfast each morning, to put the worst behind us. There's wisdom in that.

112,Coronavirus: Opposition parties warn government is 'playing catch-up' and must be honest with population;Boris Johnson U-turn on refusal to ban mass gatherings as other countries follow international advice,"March 14, 2020 Saturday",International,The Independent (United Kingdom),881,881,England & Wales,Jon Stone,Coronavirus: Opposition parties warn government is 'playing catch-up' and must be honest with populationBoris Johnson U-turn on refusal to ban mass gatherings as other countries follow international advice,"Opposition parties have warned that the government does not look ""fully in control"" of the coronavirus situation after it appeared to U-turn on whether to take action to stop mass gatherings.Labour said ministers had a duty to ""be clear with people"" about their strategy, while the Liberal Democrats accused Boris Johnson of ""playing catch-up with the rest of British society"".Going into the weekend the government said it would go ahead with a ban on big events after spending the week downplaying the usefulness of such measures. It follows a string of independent decisions by organisers of events like the Premier League and London Marathon to call off their events on their own accord. The government's chief scientific advisors have said alternately that implementing widespread ""social distancing"" policies now could either have little effect, or undermine efforts to build ""herd immunity"" among the British population.But with the UK increasingly isolated in Europe as one of the few states not to bring in tough measures, Whitehall sources say some restrictions will likely come in from next week - though details are yet to follow. Both the World Health Organisation (WHO) and the EU's European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC) recommended the rapid implementation of social distancing measures last week, while most of Britain's neighbours like Ireland, France, Denmark and Belgium have followed the international advice.A ban on mass gatherings would still represent limited action: across the Channel in Belgium all restaurants, bars, and clubs were ordered to close at 10.30pm on Friday and not reopen for two weeks. Shops will have their opening hours restricted, and schools will be shut, while people who can work from home have been told to do so.But The Times newspaper reports that ministers could go further and bring in sweeping powers to allow police to detain infected people. Care homes could also be allowed to relax standards to deal with staff shortages.Addressing the UK government's change of policy, Ed Davey, the acting leader of the Liberal Democrats, told the BBC: ""It's a surprisingly rapid change from yesterday's position and there is a slight danger that the government doesn't look like it's fully in control because of that.""Nevertheless we've seen those people who host sporting events, Premier League clubs, motor racing, taking their own decisions and it does look a little bit like government's playing catch up with the rest of British society.""Labour's shadow health secretary John Ashworth meanwhile welcomed the policy change, but called on the government to be more transparent about how it was making its decisions.                     Now that they've moved into the delay phase, and I welcome that, I've suggested they also need to move into the explain phase                   Jonathan Ashworth, Labour's shadow health secretary""Now that they've moved into the delay phase, and I welcome that, I've suggested they also need to move into the explain phase,"" he said.""We are acting responsibly as an opposition, but I have to be frank with you -when members of the public are getting in touch with us, raising their concerns, telling us that they don't think there's enough information coming out, asking us questions which I believe are legitimate questions about why is Ireland going down on particularly route and France going down one particular route and we are not - I think we have a duty as an opposition to be raising those concerns and asking the government to clarify that position for us.""I do think it's incumbent upon the government be clear with people. If that means publishing the scientific modelling so that all the experts can analyse it and peer review it and stress test it, if that maintains public confidence that's an important step, I believe.""The shift by the government to shut down public events is expected to be justified on the grounds of the burden put on public services, including the hard-pressed NHS and the police.Mr Ashworth said the move was ""an entirely reasonable point of view from the government because every big event has to be supported by police officers, supported by paramedics"" which would now be freed up to help with the outbreak. But he questioned the behavioural science behind the initial idea that banning gatherings could make the situation worse by driving people to congregate elsewhere.""I don't know if you've ever been to a football game but plenty of the fans tend to go to the pub before the game and after the game,"" he said. ""When you have big events people do congregate in pubs and restaurants and cafes. If the government were saying that's the worst thing that would happen: people would go to pubs and restaurants and cafes... well they do it anyway.""UK officials have confirmed 798 cases of COVID-19 - an increase of 208 in 24 hours. Meanwhile, the death toll rose to 11 with the first fatality to be announced in Scotland.Public Health England has recommended the sick stay clear of care homes but fell short of an outright ban on visitors, while mayoral and local elections have been suspended by a year. Parliament will limit visitors from Monday and reduce overseas travel for MPs, while airlines like British Airways have warned of job losses.",Newspaper; Web Publication

He took on the role of chief medical officer for England last October following the departure of Dame Sally Davies, after serving as the Government's interim chief scientific adviser.He has travelled the world to research previous outbreaks and holds a position at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical medicine.A specialist in epidemiology, he worked extensively on the fight against the ebola virus while the chief scientific adviser for the Department for International Development.He was the Government's go-to man in the wake of the 2018 Salisbury chemical attack.Patrick Vallance The man advising the Government on scientific issues during the outbreak has previously helped oversee the development of more than a dozen drugs.Mr Vallance, below, left a senior role in one of the world's biggest pharmaceutical companies to take up the post of chief scientific adviser in 2018.He sat on the board of Glaxo-SmithKline (GSK) and was its president of research of development between 2012 and 2017.During this period, he was instrumental in the clearance of 14 new drugs for use globally. The medicine developed under his watch included treatment for diseases including cancer and HIV, according to the Government.Simon Stevens The chief executive, right, for NHS England is facing the prospect of hospitals across the country coming under extraordinary strain in the coming months.The Government hopes to delay the spread of coronavirus to mitigate the demand placed on the NHS, which is traditionally busiest during the winter months.Sir Simon took the health service's top job in 2014 after previously working as the Government's health policy adviser in the No10 policy unit.He was described last year as ""the most dominant NHS figure in modern times - and arguably since Nye Bevan"" by the Health Service Journal.This week, he told an event in Birmingham that thousands of trainee nurses could be called upon to join the fight against the coronavirus.Nudge Unit Another key party in the handling of Britain's most serious health crisis.Officially known as the Behavioural Insights Team, it was set up in 2010 by David Cameron with a view to applying behavioural science to public policy.Nudge theory - which aims to influence mass behaviour through subtle coaxes - has already been brought to bear on decisions such as the ban on mass gatherings.It also explains why Boris Johnson has taken to appearing with various senior medical officers and scientists, as it imbues his message with a sense of expert authority.",Newspaper

Yesterday morning, as Boris Johnson gathered his inner circle in the cabinet room at Downing Street, his message was more prosaic but no less urgent.""We need to be taking all measures necessary,"" he said. ""We must work around the clock.""News had reached the prime minister that the coronavirus infection rate is accelerating faster than the government's model had predicted. Yesterday the UK death toll doubled to 21. It was a moment when theory collided with brutal reality.""They aren't enjoying this much,"" said one colleague of the prime minister and his team. ""They look haunted. They know his entire premiership will be defined by the decisions they make.""For much of last week the government had promoted a strategy of delaying the worst of the virus, acting only where there was clear scientific proof that it would save lives.On Thursday all those with symptoms were urged to self-isolate for a week. While other countries banned mass events, Johnson followed the advice of the government's medical and scientific experts that it would do little good. But at 10pm on Friday it was announced that mass events will be banned at the end of this week. What changed?First, there was a view that it was better to be seen to be acting even if the benefits are marginal. ""Stopping mass gatherings may not do much good but it has very little downside,"" said a government source.""Closing schools is different. That is bad policy. It causes workforce shortages as people seek childcare.""Second, growing reports of problems on the ground convinced Johnson's team that parts of the system are already falling over. On Friday medics at King's College Hospital in London, which has dealt with 18 cases of Covid-19, told Public Health England: ""We are drowning.""A Whitehall official said: ""We are looking at Italyand there are fears that it starts happening here sooner rather than later. You're going to see people dying in hospital corridors soon.""In the emergency planning sector, local resilience forums are demanding instructions from central government. ""The scientific advisory group and Public Health England have melted down in the past 24 hours,"" said a Whitehall source.""This is now a full-on Hollywood movie horror show. The local resilience forums are screaming for help.""The government's response begins each day at 8.15am with a meeting chaired by Dominic Cummings, Johnson's most senior official, and Mark Sweeney, director-general of the cabinet secretariat.At 9am the prime minister takes charge of a second meeting, led by ""the three amigos"" who have fronted the government's press conferences - Johnson; Chris Whitty, the chief medical officer; and Sir Patrick Vallance, the chief scientific adviser. Others present include Matt Hancock, the health secretary, adviser Sir Edward Lister and No 10 communications chief Lee Cain.Insiders say Cummings and Vallance have forged a close partnership. Cabinet Office Cobra meetings follow in the afternoon, some chaired by Johnson, some by Hancock and others by officials.At 6pm Cain and Alex Aiken, executive director of government communications, lead a cross-government messaging meeting. Johnson and his top team have a catch-up from about 6.30pm.Despite differences between British and overseas medics there seems to be no disagreement between the health experts and political aides inside government over the main strategy, which is to use the most draconian measures when they are likely to have maximum effect to stop the NHS collapsing.In private, there have been tensions between Downing Street and Public Health England over how that strategy is communicated. A briefing for reporters with senior health officials was cancelled yesterday without explanation.David Halpern, of the Whitehall ""nudge unit"", was ""given a bollocking"" last week by Cain when he introduced the phrase ""herd immunity"" into the debate, giving the impression that the government wants 60% of the population to be infected.Instead the view is that the virus is unstoppable and that artificially suppressing it could lead to a second wave of infections next winter when the restrictions are lifted, killing more.""As you lift the measures, it comes back harder,"" a senior government source said. ""Some people seem to be under the misapprehension that we can stop it. That ship has sailed globally. What we need to do is mitigate and safeguard as many people as possible.""In a Cobra meeting on Thursday, Nicola Sturgeon, the Scottish first minister, said she would take a different tack on shutting down mass events. ""She openly said it wouldn't make any health difference but it would send the right message,"" said a government official.That approach has now been adopted in London. The problem is that the details are being worked out in the middle of the crisis. A Whitehall official said the government's pandemic plan ""was always a strategic plan - it never went into the operational detail"".One MP said Whitty and Vallance are ""human shields"" for Johnson but if the death rate is higher than other countries then ""that won't be enough"".A longstanding Tory said: ""Boris is a Darwinian. He believes in the survival of the fittest. His whole career is based on that. But the danger is that we have more deaths than comparable countries.""Another MP observed that the political peril is double-edged since those most likely to die are the elderly: ""The problem is that it is Tory voters who will be dying.""

The Prime Minister's inner circle is led by Sir Patrick Vallance, the UK's Chief Scientific Adviser, and Prof Chris Whitty, the Chief Medical Officer.Called the 'three amigos' by insiders, they are supported by Dominic Cummings, Health Secretary Matt Hancock, and No 10 Director of Communications Lee Cain. Mr Johnson's dedicated Covid-19 task force also contains David Halpern - head of the Government's 'nudge unit', which advises on public behaviour - who was 'bollocked' last week for loose talk on the controversial 'herd immunity' strategy. Katharine Hammond, the Director of the Civil Contingencies Secretariat, reportedly leads a nationwide network of local resilience forums.Also involved in the plan to delay the spread of the deadly contagion is Cobra military representative Lieutenant-General Doug Chalmers.Chalmers is said to be coordinating plans for the Armed Forces to support public services, like guarding supermarkets and hospitals, during the pandemic.The final member of the Prime Minister's inner circle is Prof Yvonne Doyle, who - as Director of Health Protection at Public Health England - is described as the 'main link' between No 10 and the NHS, according to The Sunday Times. Mr Johnson's team has been assembled to manage the escalating pandemic, which so far has claimed 35 lives and infected nearly 1,400 people. In public, they are putting on a brave face as they appeal to British society to pull together in a 'national effort' amid scenes of panic-buying.Behind the Black Door, away from prying eyes, though, the Prime Minister and his advisers believe Covid-19 is essentially unstoppable.In private, Mr Johnson has emphasised to his inner circle the need to be seen to be taking action, following last week's charges of 'complacency'. They 'fear' a second wave of infections this winter leading to more fatalities, so are keen to be taking action as public opinion demands more of the State. According to one Government source, this includes banning mass gatherings - secretly regarded by decision-makers as a 'marginal' move: 'Stopping mass gatherings may not do much good but it has very little downside'.One source told the newspaper: 'Some people seem to be under the misapprehension that we can stop it. That ship has sailed globally. What we need to do is mitigate and safeguard as many people as possible.' Mr Johnson's team believes 'all measures necessary' should be taken to halting the spread of the bug - fearing an Italy-style fallout. An unnamed Tory MP described the Prime Minister as a 'Darwinian' who fears the potential backlash at home if Covid-19 claims more UK lives than lives abroad, while another remarked: 'The problem is that it is Tory voters who will be dying'. Meanwhile, sources close to Mr Johnson say the Executive is panicking that parts of the UK's healthcare system are already in 'meltdown'. Local resilience forums are reportedly begging for directives from central Government, with one Whitehall source remarking: 'This is now a full-on Hollywood movie horror show. The local resilience forums are screaming for help.'",Web Publication
118,Coronavirus: health experts fear epidemic will 'let rip' through UK;Doctors and scientists urge government to stop ignoring strategies from countries that have brought cases downCoronavirus - latest updatesSee all our coronavirus coverage,"March 15, 2020 Sunday",International,The Guardian (London),886,886,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,Sarah Boseley Health editor,Coronavirus: health experts fear epidemic will 'let rip' through UKDoctors and scientists urge government to stop ignoring strategies from countries that have brought cases downCoronavirus - latest updatesSee all our coronavirus coverage,"Public health experts and hundreds of doctors and scientists at home and abroad are urging the UK government to change its strategy against coronavirus, amid fears it will mean the epidemic ""lets rip"" through the population.They say the UK is turning its back on strategies that have successfully brought down the numbers of infections and deaths in other countries.On Thursday, Boris Johnson and his medical and scientific advisers announced that only those seriously ill in hospital would be tested. Anyone who had any symptoms should self-isolate at home for seven days, without notifying the NHS.Banning mass gatherings would not help reduce the spread of infections, the prime minister and his advisers said - although it now seems likely, largely in response to sporting and entertainment bodies cancelling events of their own accord.Anthony Costello, a UK paediatrician and former director of the World Health Organization (WHO), said he had personally written to the chief medical officer, Professor Chris Whitty, asking for testing to continue in the community.""The key principles from WHO are intensive surveillance,"" he told the Guardian. ""You test the population like crazy, find out where the cases are, immediately quarantine them and do contact tracing and get them out of the community. This deals with family clusters. That's the key bedrock of getting this under control.""This was how South Korea, China, Japan, Hong Kong and Taiwan had brought their case numbers down. ""You can really take people out of the population and make sure they are quarantined. That is vital - before you get to social distancing.""Yet the UK government was stopping tests outside of hospital. ""For me and the WHO people I have spoken to, this is absolutely the wrong policy. It would mean it just lets rip,"" he said.Costello thinks we will be in the same position as Italy within two weeks. ""The basic public health approach is playing second fiddle to mathematical modelling,"" he said.Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO's director general, expressed his deep concern on Friday at the end of testing and contact tracing in the UK and some other European countries.""You can't fight a virus if you don't know where it is,"" he said. ""Find, isolate, test and treat every case to break the chains of Covid transmission. Every case we find and treat limits the expansion of the disease.""Devi Sridhar, professor of global public health at The University of Edinburgh, listed on Twitter the reasons for continuing to test. ""1 People can alter behaviour based on whether they have Covid. 2 Break chains of transmission. 3 Local hospitals can plan for how many patients will need care. 4 To know where cases are emerging (hotspots). 5 How do we know how large problem is?""A government minister in Singapore has also expressed dismay. ""One concern we have with cases such as UK and Switzerland isn't just about the numbers. It is that these countries have abandoned any measure to contain or restrain the virus,"" minister for national development, Lawrence Wong, said at a press briefing on Sunday. ""If there's no attempt to contain, we estimate the number of cases in these countries to rise significantly in the coming days and weeks.""An open letter from a group including some of the UK's most senior doctors asked the government to publish the modelling and any other evidence for the policies it is pursuing. ""Our country's public health response to Covid-19 is demonstrably different to most other countries' responses globally and in Europe ... There is also no clear indication that the UK's response is being informed by experiences of other countries in containing the spread of Covid-19,"" it said, pointing out the risks to the NHS of a rapid and huge surge in cases of people needing hospital treatment. The UK has 2.5 beds per 1,000 people in the population, they said, which is fewer than France (6), Italy (3.2) and the United States (2.8).Immunologists, in a separate open letter, said they had ""significant questions"" about the government's apparent strategy to rely on building up ""herd immunity"" by exposure to the virus in the UK. Sir Patrick Vallance, the chief scientific adviser, has suggested this might be a good outcome from many people becoming infected.Herd immunity is usually brought about by vaccination - not exposing people to the risks of a disease. ""The ultimate aim of herd immunity is to stop disease spread and protect the most vulnerable in society. However, this strategy only works to reduce serious disease if, when building that immunity, vulnerable individuals are protected from becoming ill, for example through social distancing. If not, the consequences could be severe,"" says the letter from the British Society for Immunology.Behavioural scientists joined the concern, saying they believed the government should immediately bring in social distancing measures and not delay for fear of the public getting ""behavioural fatigue"".""If 'behavioural fatigue' truly represents a key factor in the government's decision to delay high-visibility interventions, we urge the government to share an adequate evidence base in support of that decision.

This must be hosted by a government minister or the prime minister himself, with experts and advisers available to answer questions as appropriate,"" Starmer said.Rebecca Long-Bailey also called for daily briefings to be broadcast, and Lisa Nandy said the government had to publish much better information because the last 48 hours had been ""a real shambles"".Nandy singled out as an example Sir Patrick Vallance, the government's chief scientific adviser, giving an interview on Friday morning defending the decision not to ban large sporting events only for No 10 to brief that evening that a ban would soon be implemented.In his interview, Vallance also spoke about the potential advantage of the UK acquiring some element of ""herd immunity"" to coronavirus, echoing an argument used by another adviser and the head of government's behavioural insights team, Dr David Halpern, earlier in the week.Vallance's comments triggered a fierce backlash on social media, with people claiming it amounted to evidence that the government was happy for large numbers of people to get coronavirus. On Sunday, Hancock had to distance himself from Vallance, saying ""herd immunity is not our goal or policy"".The health secretary then found himself being contradicted by officials in Scotland. He said the government would soon ask the over-70s to ""stay self-isolated"" at home for four months, but his use of the term ""self-isolate"" was taken by some to mean the elderly would be told not just to minimise contact with others, but to avoid it altogether.Catherine Calderwood, Scotland's chief medical officer, told the BBC that what was being proposed for elderly people was ""reducing social contact, rather than self-isolating"" and that it was ""scaremongering"" to suggest they would be told to sit ""home alone"".When Jason Leitch, the Scottish government's national clinical director, posted a message on Twitter making the same point, Sturgeon commended him for providing ""important clarity"".Sturgeon went on to add in another tweet: ""Giving clear and consistent information to public at the right time on coronavirus is vital. Governments' media strategies must reflect the importance of that.""",Newspaper

122,"Depression from quarantine may last for years, warns ESRI","March 15, 2020 Sunday",International,thetimes.co.uk,568,568,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,Colin Coyle,"Depression from quarantine may last for years, warns ESRI","The Economic and Social Research Institute (ESRI) has warned that extending isolation periods beyond the initial planned time frame can ""demoralise people and increase non-compliance"". The think tank has also said that depression and substance abuse linked to being in quarantine can last up to three years afterwards.The warnings are contained in a hastily written paper looking at how behavioural science can be used to help fight the coronavirus. The researchers looked at previous global studies, including 24 recent papers involving individuals being quarantined for durations ranging from several days to several weeks.Encouragingly, they note that ""mutual assistance is a more common response to a crisis than mass panic and social disorder"". They have found evidence that public authorities ""often overestimate the likelihood of panic and public disorder, including the role of the media in propagating it"" by using ""unhelpful, alarming language such as 'killer virus'"".The ESRI said some caveats are necessary because the paper ""has been produced more rapidly and at shorter notice than would be standard"".It lists a number of ways to encourage people to comply with self-isolation and cope with the consequences. Creating sleep and exercise routines is important to ward off depression, with children ""especially susceptible"" to changes in routine. Alarms should be set at usual times, and people should maintain regular working hours.They said healthcare workers were particularly at risk from depression because they ""can become concerned about failing to support co-workers during the outbreak"" or face stigma following quarantine. The authors advise the authorities to set up additional mental health services such as telephone advice lines.They note that one of the most effective arguments to promote compliance is that ""self-isolation in response to symptoms is the best way for all of us to prevent infecting each other"" because ""the more people feel part of a group or community response, the more likely they are to make a selfless contribution"".The authors also say that ""where behaviour falls short, a reasonable degree of disapproval is helpful; polite but clear interventions when official advice is not followed are likely to improve behaviour"".They also reported that urging the public to wash their hands is not enough to change behaviour, but placing hand sanitisers and colourful signage in central locations in public buildings ""increases use substantially"".The authors note that messages communicating new social norms, such as ""four out of five people wash their hands every time"", have been proven not to increase hand washing. Instead, messages ""linked to disgust"" tend to be effective.They also warn that advising people not to touch their face can lead to increased face-touching. Observational studies suggest that people touch their mouth, nose and eyes between 10 to 20 times an hour. ""When people are asked to self-record face touching, it increases rather than decreases, meaning that making people self-conscious may backfire,"" they say.Instead of promoting public health messages discouraging face-touching, the authorities may be better off telling the public that ""scratching with a sleeve is fine, just as it is now advised to sneeze or cough into the elbow or upper arm rather than the hand"". In workplaces, tissues should be distributed and kept ""at arm's reach"".",Web Publication
123,The government's herd immunity plan is callous and dangerous;Readers respond to Boris Johnson's apparent strategy to tackle the Covid-19 outbreak,"March 15, 2020 Sunday",International,The Guardian (London),1047,1047,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,Letters,The government's herd immunity plan is callous and dangerousReaders respond to Boris Johnson's apparent strategy to tackle the Covid-19 outbreak,"It seems that our government has decided that the spread of coronavirus in the population to levels creating herd immunity is inevitable, and indeed desirable ( Why rely on nudge theory to fight a virus?, Journal, 14 March). However, on the basis of China, (and indeed South Korea), where by stringent measures the spread of the virus was halted in its tracks at a relatively low level, massive population spread is not inevitable.We have not been told why such a policy by contrast is not appropriate for the UK. Given the pitifully low level of intensive care unit facilities and trained ICU staff here, it would seem even more critical for our country that the spread of the virus is not merely managed as an epidemiological case study, but stopped before the NHS is completely overwhelmed, as it will be at the levels of infection calmly being predicted by the government and its advisers.The approach looks dangerously like callous complacency rather than urgent emergency intervention. If carnage unfolds, we will look to the experience of other countries, and if we have a significantly higher death rate than others, our government will not be forgiven. Stephen SmithGlasgow The UK government's strategy to minimise the impact of Covid-19 ""is to allow the virus to pass through the entire population so that we acquire herd immunity"". Implicit in this is the acceptance of large numbers of deaths of vulnerable people, hence Boris Johnson saying that many families will lose loved ones. This sounds dangerously like what Malthus described in 1798 as ""positive checks"", which lead to premature death from disease, starvation and war, resulting in what is called a Malthusian catastrophe. In contrast, nearly every other government in Europe is pursuing a different strategy - one of containment. For once, the phrase ""being ahead of the curve"", has deep meaning. Tom ConroyDublin, Ireland It has long been obvious that Boris Johnson exists in a moral vacuum, but to propose a public policy that tacitly accepts the potential death of thousands of people is beyond shameful and, equally so, to try to minimise its impact as the loss of loved ones before their time. Not only should we question the scientific validity of herd immunity, which the World Health Organization rejects, but also its morality. No wonder the rest of the world is looking with incredulity at the UK government's response to Covid-19. Alan WalkerProfessor of social policy, University of Sheffield There is a reason why doctors take the Hippocratic oath. Now when key decisions on coronavirus are made by politicians, perhaps they should take it too.If herd immunity works, it will be at the cost of avoidable deaths - of patients, health workers and doctors. If it doesn't work, we will have a social experiment that failed, at the cost of many human lives. Boris Johnson said that ""many more families are going to lose loved ones before their time"". He should have finished his sentence with ""and many of those deaths are avoidable"".Other countries aren't doing this, for good reason. If one of my friends or family die under this policy, I will seriously look at crowdfunding a judicial review. I think we should do everything possible to change this heartless and arrogant approach. Amanda EdwardsVelindre, Llandysul Tony Yates quotes Patrick Vallance, the chief scientific adviser, as explaining part of the reason for not embracing bans (on gatherings) is to encourage ""herd immunity"". Surely this is a misinterpretation of what herd immunity is? Before the polio vaccine was developed people got polio. They didn't get herd immunity. Herd immunity is predicated on vaccination and it is the vaccinated who constitute the herd, not those with the disease. No vaccine just means more disease, not more immunity. This seems like a dangerous misunderstanding for one in such a pivotal role to make. Dr Andrew PlatmanGP retired, Beckenham, Kent  Your correspondents ( Show us the evidence behind Covid-19 policies, Journal, 14 March) are justified in their scepticism of the government's response to Covid-19; Boris Johnson and his colleagues haven't always been transparent on other matters. However, I do trust the chief medical officer (CMO) and chief scientific adviser (CSA), - expert clinician-scientists - and they appear to be leading decision-making at the moment.The CMO and CSA are wrestling with complex, contradictory, partial and rapidly-changing data, and formulating recommendations as best they can. Of course, there's a debate to be had as to why experts in other countries are initiating more severe restrictions, and more transparency on the modelling information being used would be welcome. More proscriptive actions come with significant risks of their own. For example, closing schools will potentially remove parents employed in health and social care from the workforce at this critical time and/or expose grandparents (the most vulnerable demographic) to risk of increased viral exposure if they take on childcare responsibilities.There is a risk that the government will start to ignore the advice of the CMO and CSA; I do not believe that these two professionals would allow their public health recommendations to be overridden for political expediency. Dr Miles MaxwellHitchin, Hertfordshire In the last 10 years of Tory control, the NHS has lost 100,000 doctors and nurses and 17,000 beds ( Journal, 10 March). This has not been accidental, but deliberate, and has rendered the NHS incapable of dealing with this virus, whatever the government claims. I'm almost 82 and feeling quite chirpy. If I eventually drop off my perch thanks to the virus and the Tories' destruction of the NHS, I intend to return and systematically haunt every guilty member of that administration on a daily basis.

Prof Michie sits on a specially convened panel advising the Government's Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies on its response to the coronavirus pandemic, but said she was speaking as an ""independent expert"".She is also director of UCL's Centre for Behaviour Change. Her intervention follows strong criticism by figures such as Rory Stewart, the independent candidate to become mayor of London, who has claimed that Boris Johnson and Sadiq Khan, the current mayor of the capital, have been ""far too slow to respond to this"". Mr Stewart called for the immediate closure of schools and banning of large gatherings, and said people should be encouraged to work from home.Jeremy Hunt, the former health secretary, said that ""people could be encouraged to work from home to reduce crowding on tubes, buses and trains"".Richard Horton, the editor-in-chief of The Lancet medical journal, also accused the Government of a ""major error"" for not implementing urgent ""closure policies"".Mr Johnson, following the advice of officials, has said that the Government is ""not closing schools now"".However, No10 is preparing to cancel sporting events, concerts and other ""mass gatherings"" from next week. It comes after Scotland outlawed crowds of more than 500 people.Sources said the plans were intended to help alleviate the burden that large events put on police and the health service.Officials were concerned that suddenly putting thousands of children in need of parental childcare could seriously damage already fragile staffing levels in key public services.The Government has indicated that schools should only close if specifically advised following a spate of unilateral temporary closures.Prof Michie said: ""One of the things that we have been saying is that people need clear, consistent advice.""If you do get people questioning government advice it really does undermine it and give permission for people to ignore it.""She added that those who believe that things ""are really not going the right way"" have a ""duty to raise those concerns"". Prof Michie said she hoped their interventions were ""evidencebased"" such as Mr Johnson's reliance on the advice of Sir Patrick Vallance, the chief scientific adviser, and Chris Whitty, the chief medical officer.Prof Michie added: ""Some people have a different point of view … because they're in a situation where actually it's fine because they can work from home.""But a lot of people, if they don't go into work, they lose their jobs and their children go hungry.""This is the kind of situation we are talking about.""She added: ""I think that some of the people who are speaking out don't quite realise the big repercussions on people's lives that are clearly very different to their own.""Sir Patrick has said that the thinking behind the current approach, which involves less radical measures such as individuals self-isolating in the event that they display symptoms, is intended to ""reduce the peak"" of the outbreak in the UK and to build up a ""degree of herd immunity so that more people are immune to the disease"".But Mr Stewart, a former international development secretary, has insisted: ""Schools should be closed already.""Gatherings should be banned … All the evidence from other countries is that the sooner you move to close schools, stop gatherings and encourage people to work from home, the more chance you have of getting on top of this and reducing the death toll.""Prof Michie also revealed that regular surveys are being carried out to assess the response of the public to current and potential measures - amid concern that adopting draconian measures too early could result in ""fatigue"".SELF HELP TOP TIPS TO STAY VIRUS FREE Use tissues Taking tissues with you when leaving home should be built into your daily routines.Prof Susan Michie, a health psychologist at University College London, says that the most common reason for individuals not using tissues to catch a cough or sneeze is that they simply have none on them.She suggests that people ensure they have tissues with them every time they check whether they have remembered items such as front door keys or a mobile telephone.Wash your hands Prof Michie suggests that people adhere to self-enforced rules about washing hands in particular situations, such as doing so when entering a building as well as before preparing or eating food.Don't touch your face Evidence suggests that we typically touch our faces 20 times or more per hour, often without realising.As it is an ""automatic habit"", Prof Michie suggests substituting it for an ""alternative behaviour"" in order to break it.

Richard Lee, its chief operating officer, said: ""We are ready to provide any extra support required as a consequence of the Covid-19 outbreak.""At the same time dozens of local initiatives have sprung up.St Margaret's church, in West Hoathly, West Sussex, has set up a ""find a phone buddy"" scheme to encourage people to link up with neighbours before they go into self-isolation. In Walthamstow, north east London, a database of volunteers has been launched by Kizzy Gardiner, the area's locum MP, to marshal people who can ""deliver food parcels, check in on the elderly and ensure food banks are well stocked"". Ms Gardiner is also urging constituents to set up street WhatsApp groups to keep in touch and provide essentials to self-isolating neighbours. Similar efforts are under way in south London, where Sarah Jones, the Croydon Central MP, has called for people to help. She added: ""I am gathering a database of people who may want to be in a position to help with voluntary work that may become necessary, such helping ensure elderly people have the supplies they need.""Government advisers said such efforts were essential to ensure those who go into self-isolation with virus symptoms do not feel abandoned.Prof Susan Michie, a University College London health psychologist who is advising the Government's scientific advisory group for emergencies, said: ""It's important to really look out for everyone in the community - food deliveries, setting up phone rotas to check how people are. We really need to engender that sort of spirit.""FareShare, a national food bank charity, is appealing for more volunteers and increased Government funding, warning that those most vulnerable and living in poverty could be placed at increased risk of hunger as the coronavirus epidemic worsens.In north Dorset, doctors' surgeries and local MPs are backing the distribution of leaflets with details of residents willing to pick up supplies and carry out basic tasks for neighbours.",Newspaper

The government's approach to coronavirus is one big gambleNick Chater was an adviser to the government's 'nudge unit'See all our coronavirus coverage","March 16, 2020 Monday",International,The Guardian (London),974,974,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,Nick Chater,"People won't get 'tired' of social distancing - the government is wrong to suggest otherwiseIf people really need to stay home, they can do for months. The government's approach to coronavirus is one big gambleNick Chater was an adviser to the government's 'nudge unit'See all our coronavirus coverage","In times of national crisis, governments need to act, advise and inform. But they also need to tell stories that allow us, as citizens, to understand government policy and, crucially, to coordinate our individual efforts towards a common goal.The story isn't just ""spin""; it is a central component of policy. And whether it receives our support will be critical to determining whether, and how well, the policy is implemented, and whether it succeeds or fails. Winston Churchill's ""We shall fight on the beaches"" speech in 1940 during the Battle of France perfectly encapsulated a clear narrative of collective resistance at a time of national peril. What should the story be now?Two very different approaches are being deployed by governments across the world. Covid-19 is either a fire than must be beaten back, or even completely extinguished; or a rising tide against which resistance is futile and managed retreat is the only option.The most honest and credible narrative would be that the government doesn't, and can't, yet know the best course of actionThe fire narrative is implicit in the lockdown policies already in place in many affected countries, such as China, South Korea, Italy and Spain. The more a fire takes hold, the harder it is to fight, meaning fast, aggressive action is vital. Continual vigilance is required: each new flame must be extinguished. Crucially, putting out the fire takes precedence over everything else, lest the fire burns unchecked. Collective and individual sacrifice isn't merely justified - it's an overwhelming necessity.The tide narrative, implicit in the UK's current plans, is very different: the progress of the virus is seen as an unstoppable wave that will overwhelm temporary defences. In this metaphor, the endpoint is clear: most people (perhaps 60% to 80%) will be infected by the virus, until the point of ""herd immunity"" is reached, when new infections peter out. The only question then will be how best to manage this process: for example, trying to slow, and evenly spread, the flow of new cases over the summer months when the health system is under less strain; and trying to ensure that the elderly and vulnerable are isolated while the infection rages through the population.Policymakers should be asking three questions: which narrative is right?; which narratives are politically sustainable?; and in the light of uncertainties over the first two questions, what is the best course of action?The first question is an ongoing debate among epidemiologists and public health experts, and outside my expertise as a behavioural scientist. China and South Korea seem to have dampened the ""fire"" with astonishing success. We don't yet know how European countries will fare. And we don't yet know whether coronavirus will surge again as restrictions are loosened, although the signs in China at present seem encouraging.The UK government has made much of the danger of ""behavioural fatigue"": that people will not be able to maintain new patterns of vigilant behaviour for very long. If this is a primary reason for assuming the virus cannot be stopped, it seems a very unconvincing one (as a recent           open           letter to the UK government, of which I was a signatory, points out). But behavioural fatigue, to my knowledge, has no basis in science. Indeed, with a compelling collective narrative, people are capable of maintaining remarkable solidarity over months and years, especially at times of national crisis.The second question about which narratives are politically sustainable depends on how far the narrative can build a new, shared, ""social contract"" that citizens will be willing to back. Politically speaking, the fire narrative is far easier to sign up to. Most of us can support a heroic vision of collectively battling an epidemic (or at least tamping it down until help arrives in the form of a vaccine or a cure).The tide narrative is a harder sell: it requires society accepting that a huge burden of illness and death is inevitable; and, for that matter, the personal realisation that we will likely get sick. More crucially, perhaps, such fatalism will be very difficult to sustain while other nations are seen taking aggressive countermeasures. As soon as UK mortality statistics start to outrun those of other countries, the public pressure to shift strategy will be acute.So what should the government do? Here, I think policymakers should allow for the possibility that scientists don't yet know which narrative is right: whether covid-19 can be stopped, as the fire narrative suggests, or whether it's an unassailable tide. The virus is new, and its behaviour is relatively unknown. But a huge global scientific and medical effort is under way to understand the genetics, mutation and transmission of the virus, to model its spread, to learn from the experience of other countries, and to explore the viability of vaccines or cures.The government's bet that the virus is unstoppable - and its decision to allow it to spread through the population over the summer - is a move that, if misjudged, could lead to hundreds of thousands of unnecessary deaths.A basic principle of good decision-making under extreme uncertainty is to make choices that are robust to whichever narrative turns out to be right. Right now, surely policymakers need to buy time; and that means slowing the spread as much as possible, while we learn more.The most honest and credible narrative is surely to admit our ignorance: that the government doesn't, and can't, know yet what is best. In the meantime, we should hold back the virus with every resource we have, until the science around it is clearer. I would like to believe that, as a nation of pragmatists, this is a story we can all get behind.•Nick Chater is professor of behavioural science at Warwick Business School.",Newspaper
127,"The public deserves clear information, not confusion, on coronavirus quarantine","March 16, 2020 Monday",International,The Independent (United Kingdom),606,606,England & Wales,EDITORIAL,"The public deserves clear information, not confusion, on coronavirus quarantine","Whether the government's scientific advisers are taking the right approach in handling the growing coronavirus epidemic is not a subject for the layperson. Almost all analysis on that matter is counterproductive.But it is not to doubt or even to scrutinise the wisdom of the experts to say that the government's management of the information, and the fashion in which the public are discovering horrifying news, has been a disaster, and it must be rectified immediately.It is no exaggeration to say that hundreds of thousands of elderly people, more likely millions, spent Saturday night staring at their phones or iPads, trying to compute news that had appeared on the blog of the ITV political editor Robert Peston, that they are to be quarantined, quite possibly in requisitioned hotels, for several months, to protect them from a virulent and deadly disease.It is, quite possibly, the most life-changing single piece of information to enter the public domain in some time.Yesterday morning, the health secretary Matt Hancock appeared on several of the political television shows, to clarify the news, and could only say that, yes, quarantining the elderly is ""part of the action plan"" but that the government couldn't say ""formally"" for now, what or when it was.He would tell the BBC's Andrew Marr that it remains OK to visit elderly people, if neither you nor they are showing symptoms. That it was possible to check if someone was OK, or to deliver shopping, without going within two metres of them.So the precise nature of the quarantine, when it will happen, what it means, is still unknown, though the possibility, indeed the near certainty, of it occurring has been confirmed.Within hours of the blogpost appearing, the next stages of the country's battle plan appeared online, in the form of an article by Matt Hancock in The Sunday Telegraph, which was at first only available to read by Telegraph subscribers. The paywall restrictions were soon lifted amid a furious reaction. The reaction was correct.The article itself says that ""herd immunity"" was never part of the government's plan. Herd immunity refers, essentially, to allowing huge swathes of the UK population to catch the virus, to develop immunity, presumably during efforts to keep the elderly and vulnerable away.If ""herd immunity"" was never part of the plan, it is particularly disappointing that the chief scientific advisor, Sir Patrick Vallance, and the head of the government's Behavioural Insights Team, Dr David Halpern, have both discussed the ""herd immunity"" - with Sir Patrick doing so on the BBC Radio 4's Today programme on Friday.The precise degree of involvement of the Behavioural Insights Team, better known as the nudge unit, has become something of a bone of contention. There is, of course, nothing wrong with analysing and seeking to manage how human beings will behave in response to a virus, whose behaviour is rather more straightforward to understand.Might it, perhaps, be wise if the experts in human behaviour were to offer some guidance in how humans might behave, should they find out about their own quarantining via an ITV News blog and a down-the-line TV interview on a rolling news channel?That the prime minister has thus far seemed to be deferent to his chief scientists throughout this terrible crisis has been, in its way, reassuring. But the weekend that passed has changed everything, and the prime minister has been nowhere to be seen.Most people do not want to panic, but they do not know what to do or what to believe. That is no way to manage a crisis as serious and as frightening as this. That must change, immediately.",Newspaper
128,Battle plan backlash forces PM to recalculate;Inaction on big gatherings increases fears in No 10 that Johnson will be blamed if British death rate outpaces countries in lockdown,"March 16, 2020 Monday",International,"Financial Times (London, England)",1137,1137,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,GEORGE PARKER ; LAURA HUGHES,Battle plan backlash forces PM to recalculateInaction on big gatherings increases fears in No 10 that Johnson will be blamed if British death rate outpaces countries in lockdown,"Boris Johnson yesterday prepared to step up Britain's response to coronavirus, after 48 hours in which his measured approach to the crisis began to lose public, political and scientific support.Mr Johnson's allies insist that new measures such as banning mass gatherings, isolating the elderly or quarantining whole families could be brought forward because the epidemic was developing more quickly than expected. But the prime minister was also facing an increasingly stark political calculation: if Britain's death rate started to grow faster than EU countries such as France, Ireland or Belgium - now on lockdown - he would probably get some of the blame.The first signs of unease in Number 10 came on Friday night when journalists were briefed that mass gatherings would be banned, just 24 hours after Mr Johnson and his advisers insisted such a move would be of little merit.Indeed Patrick Vallance, the chief scientific adviser, had announced on Thursday that the first set of measures to be implemented in Britain's ""delay"" strategy were ""actually rather large"".He said that advising people with a cough or fever to self-isolate for seven days was ""a big change"". But that advice, along with a suggestion that school trips should be stopped and the elderly should avoid cruise ships, fell far short of what other countries were doing.While much of western Europe prepared to shut down to try to contain the virus, Sir Patrick and colleagues allowed the impression to take hold that Britain was resigned to about 40m or more people catching the disease - and that it would actually be a good thing.The idea of Britain developing herd immunity over a period of months - where a sufficient section of the healthy population were infected and then became immune - took hold at the end of last week, fanned by official briefings.Sir Patrick said it was desirable to build up herd immunity in the population to protect the country in the longer term. ""About 60 per cent is the sort of figure you need to get herd immunity,"" Sir Patrick told Sky News on Friday. That suggested up to 40m Britons might contract the disease under the government's plan.David Halpern, head of the semi-privatised nudge unit advising Mr Johnson on behavioural science, said: ""There's going to be a point, assuming the epidemic flows and grows as it will do, where you want to cocoon, to protect those at-risk groups. By the time they come out of their cocooning, herd immunity has been achieved in the rest of the population.""Jeremy Hunt, former health secretary, highlighted growing cross-party political worry about the strategy, saying he was ""concerned"" that tougher measures to protect the elderly had not been taken.The fact that Mr Johnson last Thursday eschewed the options of closing schools, quarantining households with a suspected coronavirus case, or telling people to work from home added to the impression that widespread infection was part of the plan.Ministers insisted that herd immunity was never part of the strategy - it did not appear in the government's ""battle plan"" earlier this month - but it alarmed many scientists who questioned whether it would work in containing this new disease.On Saturday, more than 200 scientists wrote to the government urging it to introduce tougher measures to tackle the spread of Covid-19.In an open letter, a group of 229 scientists from UK universities say the government's current approach would put the NHS under additional stress and ""risk many more lives than necessary"".Meanwhile, the World Health Organisation's director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus denounced Britain's decision to stop testing people with mild symptoms - essentially an acceptance that coronavirus would inevitably spread widely in the community.""You can't fight a virus if you don't know where it is. Find, isolate, test and treat every case, to break the chains of transmission,"" he said. ""Every case we find and treat limits the expansion of the disease.""While the WHO has lavished praise on countries such as South Korea, which have cracked down hard on the disease, the idea that Britain could become an island awash with coronavirus cases alarmed many scientists. But it also threw up a big potential political challenge for Mr Johnson: how to explain why ""loved ones"" were dying in Britain if other countries were experiencing much lower death rates.Mr Johnson's advisers said that those countries taking much tougher action would see the virus ""bounce back"" later in the year, because their countries had not acquired herd immunity.But in the short-term, Mr Johnson would have to explain to the British public that his approach was working, even as the death toll mounted.Under the government's own modelling, the disease could have a 1 per cent mortality rate. If 40m people were to contract coronavirus, the death toll could rise as high as 400,000, with the prospect of many people possibly dying in overcrowded hospitals.On Friday afternoon, it became clear that the political risks of Britain's strategy of holding back - possibly for weeks - on introducing tougher measures to fight the virus were too high. While Mr Johnson's allies and Tory MPs denied it was a ""U-turn"", the decision to ban mass gatherings in England was never intended to be implemented so swiftly.When Scotland's first minister Nicola Sturgeon announced she was banning such gatherings because of the strain they placed on the emergency services, Mr Johnson made a dig at ""resilience"" issues in the NHS north of the border.On Saturday it became clear that Mr Johnson would soon announce measures - such as isolating the elderly for up to four months - that scientists had originally expected to be held back until the disease was nearing its peak.Yesterday Matt Hancock, health secretary, distanced himself from the idea that the government strategy was explicitly aimed at building up herd immunity. ""We have a plan, based on the expertise of world-leading scientists,"" he wrote in the Sunday Telegraph. ""Herd immunity is not a part of it."" The NHS said it was a byproduct of the government strategy to control the spread of the virus.Mr Hancock said herd immunity was a scientific concept rather than a strategy. ""Our goal is to protect life from this virus, our strategy is to protect the most vulnerable and protect the NHS through contain, delay, research and mitigate.""He also indicated the government would still take a measured approach to phasing in any new measures.The sense that Mr Johnson's scienceled strategy was losing contact with politics was reinforced by a YouGov poll for the Sunday Times showing that, by a margin of 52 per cent to 26 per cent, people thought the government should declare a state of emergency.'There's going to be a point where you want to cocoon, to protect those at-risk groups'",Newspaper
129,Coronavirus: No 10 facing questions about herd immunity's human cost,"March 16, 2020 Monday",International,thetimes.co.uk,1149,1149,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,"Lucy Fisher | Kat Lay, Health Correspondent",Coronavirus: No 10 facing questions about herd immunity's human cost,"The Commons health select committee will hold an emergency evidence session tomorrow to demand clarity on the government's position on herd immunity.Government advisers have promised to publish the data they are using to make decisions after increasing questions on why the UK approach seems at odds with much of the rest of the world.Jeremy Hunt, the new chairman of the health select committee, said last week that it was ""surprising and concerning"" that Britain was not following other European countries by imposing strict restrictions on mass gatherings. Mr Hunt resigned from the cabinet after losing to Boris Johnson in last year's Conservative leadership race.Sir Patrick Vallance, chief scientific adviser to the UK, is set to be questioned by MPs days after he said that the government wanted to build up resistance to the illness in the population, a proposal denied by Matt Hancock, the health secretary, yesterday.Herd immunity is a form of indirect protection against infectious diseases such as the coronavirus when large proportions of the population become immune, often after recovering from infection.The health committee will also question Sir Simon Stevens, chief executive of the NHS, over the capacity in the health service to deal with the crisis.Sir Patrick set out the government's approach to managing the epidemic last week, saying: ""Our aim is to try to reduce the peak, broaden the peak, not suppress it completely; also, because the vast majority of people get a mild illness, to build up some kind of herd immunity.""It was explained that an attempt to suppress the virus now, instead of facilitating a managed outbreak mainly over the summer months, could lead to a higher amount of cases next winter.Distancing the government from the approach, Mr Hancock told the BBC yesterday: ""Herd immunity is not our policy, it's not our goal. Our goal is to protect life and our policy is to fight the virus and protect the vulnerable and the NHS. Of course there is a scientific debate around scientific concepts.""Asked whether young, healthy people should aim to get the virus to try to achieve herd immunity, he said: ""No, the consequence of the infection rate rising too fast is very clear.""That's why we need to bring the infection rate down, at the same time as doing the work to increase the NHS capacity especially in the areas of most need, like ventilators.""Some experts suggested that the apparent change in government strategy was down to miscommunication.David Spiegelhalter, of the Winton Centre for Risk and Evidence Communication at the University of Cambridge, said: ""[Herd immunity] is never mentioned as a short-term goal in the published strategies, and Patrick Vallance only mentioned it in relation to the longer term, if the virus returns annually. It is unfortunate that he did not immediately add that this was not a short-term goal.""Mr Hunt said that the health secretary's remarks came as a ""huge relief"". He said of the herd immunity concept: ""The cost in terms of lives lost would be catastrophic irrespective of the longer-term merits of herd immunity."" More drastic measures are needed if the government wants to curb the epidemic, he suggested.""If we are now seeking to suppress the virus, we need to follow the countries that have done that successfully, including moving immediately to more social distancing policies, not just for the elderly but anyone who might come into contact with them,"" he said.There has been increasing debate among scientists over Britain's approach. A letter published on Saturday from 270 scientists, although not all specialists in epidemiology or infectious diseases, called for more restrictive social distancing measures to be put in place ""immediately"". In a separate letter, the British Society for Immunology said that it had ""significant questions about [the UK's] strategy"". The government's Scientific Advisory Group on Emergencies said yesterday that it would begin publishing the modelling and data behind its decisions.There have also been calls for more transparent briefing from politicians.Lord Barwell, Theresa May's former chief of staff, said: ""I cannot say this strongly enough: ministers need to stop anonymously briefing journalists and start speaking directly to the public. Trust in government is going to be vital during the difficult months ahead and it is best fostered by transparency, not off-the-record briefing.""                   'Change tack or lose public support'                   Ministers risk losing public co-operation for drastic measures to combat the virus unless their approach changes, a leading behavioural scientist has said.Susan Michie, professor of health psychology at University College London, said Matt Hancock, the health secretary, should stop making announcements and the government's two most prominent advisers must show they have learnt from setbacks.Public anxiety had been heightened by Britain seeming to take weaker measures than other countries and by confusion over herd immunity, she said. ""When people feel that there appears to be some inconsistency or when don't fully understand the rationale for the policies, then that causes anxiety.""Professor Michie is a member of a behavioural science group that offers advice to the government's scientific advisers on emergencies, but spoke to                    The Times                    in a personal capacity.She said it was unhelpful of Mr Hancock to have written a newspaper article and given interviews yesterday on forthcoming measures to tackle the virus without the chief scientific and medical advisers, Sir Patrick Vallance and Chris Whitty.""If different things are coming from different people at different times it is very unsettling for people,"" she said. ""The chief scientist and chief medical officer are trusted sources, and it is important that they are the ones delivering these messages, otherwise there is going to be a lot of consternation.""But Sir Patrick and Professor Whitty should, she said, have published supporting evidence at their press conference on Thursday when they said they would not close schools in England or introduce social distancing policies.It was a mistake, too, for Sir Patrick to have spoken of herd immunity - a difficult concept, she said.""If you lose trust it is difficult to build up again but I don't think Chris and Patrick have lost trust irretrievably. I just think it is something that really needs to be looked at,"" Professor Michie said.""When it is a fast-moving situation there will always be things that don't go smoothly. The key thing is that people show that they are listening and they have learnt the lessons.""If I were in their shoes I would do daily or every other day bulletins.""More must also be done, she said, to acknowledge that self-isolation is more difficult for certain groups of people, such as those in poor housing.",Newspaper; Web Publication
130,ACTION STATIONS Is the UK government doing enough to contain spread of coronavirus?,"March 16, 2020 Monday",International,thesun.co.uk,1485,1485,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,Gemma Mullin,ACTION STATIONS Is the UK government doing enough to contain spread of coronavirus?,"                     THE list of European countries going into coronavirus lockdown is growing and the US has begun introducing strict controls on public life.                   But the UK is yet to introduce restrictions seen elsewhere - despite seeing the biggest daily jump in deaths yesterday.                                          Read our coronavirus live blog for the latest news & updates                   Some experts have warned that Britain is turning its back on strategies that have successfully reduced deaths and cases in other countries.Instead the government is attempting a staged response to delay the spread of Covid-19 and reduce the epidemic's peak.Last week, the Prime Minister said that only those seriously ill in hospital would be tested for coronavirus.Everyone else with symptoms should self-isolate at home for seven days - and not call NHS 111.Boris Johnson said that banning mass gatherings - as they have done in places like Italy and Spain - wouldn't help to reduce the spread of the disease.However, it seems that many sports and entertainment companies are beginning to cancel events on their own accord.Starting today, Downing Street will give daily briefings on the outbreak to keep the public up to date on the fight against the disease.It comes after No 10 was criticised for an apparent lack of transparency over its plans to stem coronavirus.                     'Herd immunity'                   Last week, England's chief scientific adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance, said the Government's decision not to introduce tougher measures could have the benefit of creating ""herd immunity"" across the population as people become infected.He said the idea is to ""reduce the peak, broaden the peak, not suppress it completely"".Sir Patrick said that around two-thirds of the British population would need to get coronavirus for herd immunity to stave off the disease in the future.However, Health Secretary Matt Hancock has subsequently said herd immunity is not part of the government's strategy.                     Tap to see where COVID-19 is near you                    He said: ""That is a scientific concept, not a goal or a strategy. Our goal is to protect life from this virus, our strategy is to protect the most vulnerable and protect the NHS through contain, delay, research and mitigate.""A former director at the World Health Organisation (WHO) questioned the government's tactics and argued they looked like they were against the policy set down by the agency.Anthony Costello, professor of international child health, said on Twitter: ""Doesn't this herd immunity strategy conflict with WHO policy?""After the announcement of this being a pandemic, Dr Tedros, Director General WHO, said 'The idea that countries should shift from containment to mitigation is wrong and dangerous'.""                     'Block second peak'                   Prof Costello said the Government was arguing that allowing a proportion of the population to catch the virus and gain immunity ""will block a second peak in several months' time"".But he tweeted a series of questions showing scepticism for the policy, including: ""Will it impair efforts to restrict the immediate epidemic, and cause more infections and deaths in the near term? Evidence suggests people shed virus early, and those without symptoms may cause substantial spread...""He also questioned whether ""coronavirus causes strong herd immunity or is it like flu where new strains emerge each year needing repeat vaccines? We have much to learn about Co-V immune responses.""He said there was also an argument to see what happened in China, where the epidemic there has been contained ""after 7 weeks of intense national effort"".Prof Costello added: ""Without an all-out national mobilisation plan for social distancing, are the UK government behavioural and nudge strategies really evidence-based to flatten the peak? Or simply based on models?""He suggested that ""shouldn't we go all-out to snuff this UK epidemic out, with national mobilisation at all levels, using all possible preventive measures (whether evidence is strong, uncertain or weak) and worry about herd immunity when we have more evidence?""He continued: ""Vaccines are a safer way to develop herd immunity, without the risks associated with the disease itself.""Is it ethical to adopt a policy that threatens immediate casualties on the basis of an uncertain future benefit?""                     'Continue testing'                   Prof Costello told the Guardian he had personally written to the chief medical officer, Professor Chris Whitty, asking for testing to continue in the community.He said: ""The key principles from WHO are intensive surveillance.""You test the population like crazy, find out where the cases are, immediately quarantine them and do contact tracing and get them out of the community.""This is how countries like South Korea, China, Japan, Hong Kong and Taiwan had brought their case numbers down.Yet the UK government is no longer testing anyone outside of hospitals, he warned.Prof Costello added: ""For me and the WHO people I have spoken to, this is absolutely the wrong policy. It would mean it just let's rip.""                     Middle ground                   In a separate tweet, Devi Sridhar, professor of global public health at Edinburgh University, said: ""Part of my job is speaking truth to power.""And the UK govt is (in my view) getting it wrong.""Other countries have shown speed is crucial. There is a middle path between complete shutdown & carrying on as normal.""Jeremy Rossman, honorary senior lecturer in virology at the University of Kent, added: ""A delay strategy when combined with surveillance and containment, as recommended by the WHO, could be very effective in combating the spread of COVID-19.""Yet if we slow the spread of the virus but are relying on herd immunity to protect the most vulnerable people, we would still need 47 million people to be infected.""However, Martin Hibberd, professor of emerging infectious disease at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said it was unclear how the UK policies will work compared to other European policies ""but I suspect they will be similar"".He added: ""The Government plan assumes that herd immunity will eventually happen, and from my reading hopes that this occurs before the winter season when the disease might be expected to become more prevalent.""However, I do worry that making plans that assume such a large proportion of the population will become infected (and hopefully recovered and immune) may not be the very best that we can do.""Another strategy might be to try to contain longer and perhaps long enough for a therapy to emerge that might allow some kind of treatment.""                     'No acceptable solution'                   But other experts say there may be no ""acceptable solution"" to mitigate and manage the coronavirus pandemic.Francois Balloux, professor of computational systems biology and the director of the University College London (UCL) Genetics Institute, said: ""After having spent considerable time thinking how to mitigate and manage this pandemic... I failed to identify the best course of action.""I'm not sure there is such a thing as an acceptable solution to the problem we are facing.""The Covid-19 pandemic is an extremely challenging problem and there are still many unknowns.""There is no simple fix, and poorly thought-out interventions could make the situation even worse, massively so.""Prof Balloux said it was most plausible that the Covid-19 would wane in the late spring and return in the winter, ""which I expect could be even worse than what we're facing now"", adding a similar pattern was seen in the pandemic a century ago.However, he warned that it is not known how seasonal the transmission of the virus is or if Covid-19 infection causes long-lasting immunity.""Predictions from any model are only as good as the data that parametrised it,"" Prof Balloux said.""How long immunity lasts for following Covid-19 infection is the biggest unknown. Comparison with other Coronaviridae suggests it may be relatively short-lived. If this were to be confirmed, it would add to the challenge of managing the pandemic.""Short-lived immunisation would defeat both 'flattening the curve' and 'herd immunity' approaches.""Meanwhile Good Morning Britain's resident health expert Dr Hilary Jones said that total lockdown could be counterproductive.He told hosts Piers Morgan and Susanna Reid: ""The opposite argument that we should lock everyone away now is counterproductive, because how long do you lock them down for?""How long does it take for a pandemic to peter out?""It's early days - we need to see what happens in China - there could be a second wave because people are coming out again getting fed up with being enclosed and incarcerated.""The virus is undoubtedly still out there infecting the population.""",Newspaper; Web Publication

Grant Shapps, the transport secretary, suggested this morning that older people would still be able to walk the dog.Updated government advice issued to schools this morning urges headteachers not to close but to ensure door handles and light switches are cleaned more often. As ministers try to regain the initiative after criticism at the weekend, prisons have been told to create coronavirus wings where infected prisoners can be detained together. A prison officer at High Down jail in Surrey has become the first to test positive.Mr Johnson is under pressure to spell out what he will ask of the elderly as he tries to wrest back control of the crisis at a press conference this afternoon. He has been urged to offer people ""rent holidays"" amid warnings from one of his advisers that coronavirus could push 14 million people who live in poverty into hunger and homelessness.Labour will seek to amend emergency legislation to prevent evictions of renters and allow mortgage holidays to those struggling to make ends meet because of coronavirus. The party will also demand that ministers extend and increase sick pay to millions of low-paid and gig economy workers.Dame Louise Casey, a government adviser on homelessness, said this morning: ""All of the people in low-paid jobs are facing real difficulty. We don't at the moment have a welfare system that's fit for that purpose . . . This virus is throwing a spotlight on whether we as a nation want to help people less fortunate than ourselves.""She told                    Today                    on BBC Radio 4 that government advice suggesting the low-paid turn to universal credit ""pushes people into hunger and homelessness. It's great that some of the mortgage companies are thinking about mortgage holidays. Given how long this is going to go on what about rental holidays? What about local authorities? . . . At the same time as we are looking at this in terms of health vulnerability, we need to look at this in terms of welfare vulnerability. I'm really worried about it.""The developments come as: Flight schedules have been slashed by Easyjet and British Airways's parent company, IAG. A second MP has been diagnosed with Covid-19. Kate Osborne, the Labour MP for Jarrow, tweeted: ""I would encourage everyone to band together and support the most vulnerable in our communities."" Britons are urged to ""act responsibly"" and purchase only the food and lavatory roll they need, after panic-buying left supermarket shelves empty.Matt Hancock, the health secretary, admitted yesterday that Britain had insufficient ventilators to cope with the number of people being admitted to hospital.

138,Coronavirus: mass school closures in Scotland 'not inevitable',"March 16, 2020 Monday",International,thetimes.co.uk,942,942,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,Mark McLaughlin,Coronavirus: mass school closures in Scotland 'not inevitable',"Widespread school closures ""are not inevitable"" in Scotland as they may be needed to keep emergency services personnel with children free for work, the Scottish government's national clinical director has said.Jason Leitch said control-room workers and paramedics may struggle to get to work if their children are out of school.There were 153 confirmed cases of coronavirus in Scotland according to the latest government figures published yesterday.Linda Bauld, professor of public health at Edinburgh University, said she was ""fairly confident"" that Scottish schools will close after Easter. However, Professor Leitch told BBC Radio Scotland's                    Good Morning Scotland                    that school closures may be localised, rather than Scotland-wide.He said: ""Shetland . . . has a smaller workforce and has to make specific choices about what it does with education. That will be different to what is done in Musselburgh or Partick.""Schools don't help as much with the spread of the virus. I know it seems counterintuitive . . . it would be nice if we could stop all the mass gatherings, close the schools and colleges, shut the border, hunker down, keep [the BBC] on for entertainment, get Sainsbury's to deliver the shopping and reopen in two weeks.""It doesn't work. The science suggests that when you reopen the virus will still be there, the vulnerable will be hit again and the spike will just be later.""He added: ""Schools look after [and] educate the children, so what greater place to be? It is a terrific place to talk about the virus, reduce panic, to reduce fear in that group.""Also, police control rooms are manned by people who have kids, and our paramedics have children.""Professor Leitch said governments throughout the UK will soon ask people over 70, and those with underlying health conditions, to reduce social contact. This will include avoiding public places like mosques, churches, bingo and pubs, but he stressed family visits must continue and they can still go out for a walk.He said: ""We would expect family contact to increase in that group so that those people would be looked after.""He also urged people to keep medical and dental appointments if they do not have symptoms.People with symptoms have been told to stay in their homes for a week, so they should not be visiting elderly relatives.World Health Organisation experts have questioned the UK's plan to slowly build ""herd immunity"" by keeping some public spaces open, and avoiding the mass lockdowns seen in Europe.Professor Leitch said: ""The WHO is responsible for 194 countries - the whole world - so they have to give advice that works in the Maldives, Senegal, Somalia and Scotland.""That is going to look a little bit different when it reaches the ground. Our health service isn't the same as Somalia, our health service isn't even the same at Italy, our society is different, our demographics are different, so we have to make choices for Scotland and the UK.""I wish it were simple. I wish it were a video game that if you press A then B happens. What we have to do is follow the virus around the world, get as much data as we can from these cases, follow the science that we have from our epidemiologists and our behavioural scientists, who tell us that if we say today 'four months of isolation', nobody is going to do that, it's going to break down.""You already see people panic buying, behaving differently now, and we're on day four of the mass-gathering and the symptomatic news, so we have got to be very careful when we introduce these measures.""He said up to 1.2 million people - nearly a quarter of the Scottish population - will be tested including some who do not have symptoms to check if they have the virus.Professor Bauld backed the government's decision to keep UK pubs and restaurants open at this stage, and said the UK may be right to take a different approach to other countries.She told the BBC: ""I think the border closures in Europe [are because] they are in a different situation where there is very free travel between countries, whereas we're an island so it is slightly different.""But I would say, we do need to learn from what other places are doing. It is difficult for us to implement the kind of restrictions that we have seen in Wuhan, for example, we have different type of government [who] in a way still want people to have some choice and also for the economy to not completely shut down, because we could be facing for several months, and that will have a big impact on people's lives and also on the economy.""She said slowly building ""herd immunity"" is important to protect the 20 per cent of people who may get seriously ill.However, she said ""if things don't improve then we will see the schools close after Easter, I would be fairly confident"".She added: ""We have excellent clinicians and epidemiologists in Scotland. It doesn't mean that everyone agrees. There is a lot of public concern, and also other experts saying we should follow what Europe is doing, but I think it needs to be timed, and the fact that the government has committed to giving us daily updates now means that we should have more information.""I would really like to see [the government] publish the modelling, and some of the behavioural science evidence that they are using to underpin their recommendations so that we can all have a look at the data that is being used.""Transparency is important. We live in a democracy where people have a right to information, and if we can scrutinise those figures and some of that evidence then it will give people a better understanding of why things are happening when they are happening.""",Newspaper; Web Publication

140,Boris Johnson needs a lesson in the basics of coronavirus communication - but the daily briefings are a start;We need our leaders to explain precisely how we slow the spread of the virus,"March 16, 2020 Monday",International,The Independent (United Kingdom),960,960,England & Wales,Sean O'Grady,Boris Johnson needs a lesson in the basics of coronavirus communication - but the daily briefings are a startWe need our leaders to explain precisely how we slow the spread of the virus,"To borrow a phrase, why is everyone so useless? Not the scientists, obviously, but the communications people and the politicians who are supposed to be: Explaining what is going on with coronavirus; telling us what to do about it; getting on with the job of containing/delaying it. They aren't doing that yet, and it is turning a crisis into a disaster. If Britain is supposed to be going on a wartime footing, inspired by the spirit of Dunkirk, El Alamein and the Blitz...well just say we're at the phoney war stage at best. The nation has certainly not yet found its Churchill, despite the impersonator currently residing in Number 10. Looking more haunted than defiant, and more knackered than the septuagenarian Churchill ever did in his finest hour, Boris Johnson is not emulating his great hero in uniting the nation, stiffening its sinews and unleashing a mighty call to fight coronavirus the streets, on the landing grounds, because -""we shall never surrender"".Actually that would be a bit silly in the case of a rapidly transmissible virus with no vaccine available, but you take my point. The nation has not yet found its voice, and Matt Hancock's increasingly nervous tone suggests that's because our leaders don't quite know what to say, or how to say it.What we need now is some comms basics. At last we are promised a daily press conference with all the experts - but that should include the chief executive of the NHS, Simon Stevens, the secretary for state for health and social care and, on a rolling basis, the devolved equivalents of the prime minister, the chief medical officer and chief scientific adviser (where appropriate). We inhabit a tiny collection of islands with complete freedom of movement. Thus, we cannot have on as is now happening, have the Sottish executive telling people not to go to ""mass gatherings"" and the British/English prime minister telling them it is OK for now. What is a Scottish devotee of Glastonbury supposed to do?Daily press conferences with time for plenty of questions are not, though, enough. They are useless if they are undermined by mixed messages, whether via shadowy figures in Downing Street or publicly by devolved administrations (ie Nicola Sturgeon) doing their own thing. It makes a mockery of an integrated action plan. So: No leaks; no friendly chats to The Spectator; no off message or any other briefings; and above all no more articles by Matt Hancock to specific news outlets. That is not the way to reach a mass audience or get the whole of the media on side. We are past the stage of doing favours for areas of the press (and the childish boycott of the BBC Today programme is now over).Second, the government needs to recognise no one much understands geometric progression (or its variants), behavioural science, virology, immunology, epidemiology or any other trending -ology. We'd like some simple graphics showing is what's happens. When the experts say that, for example, closing borders doesn't make much difference it would be nice to see something showing exactly that's so, and how the virus will spread.We need our leaders to explain precisely how we ""flatten the curve"" and slow the spread of the virus.In terms of our personal responsibilities, we want simple social media messages, TV spots, and newspaper ads and sponsored web pages telling us exactly what to do and not do. Why don't those clever people on the Brexit campaigns invent a few? Travellers on the London Underground and the national rail network have had ""See it, Say it, Sort it"" repeated incessantly for years; the same ought to go for, as the old slogan went, ""coughs and sneezes spread diseases"". We need extensive Q and As, answering questions from people who feel bewildered about visiting an elderly or vulnerable relative -and what to if they cannot. Maybe we could have a pamphlet continuing them delivered to very household, just as the government did in 2016 for the Brexit referendum. Some might be:•What do I do if I am asked to self-isolate but need to collect my medicines or go for a check-up?•Why can't I go outside for a walk in the park?•How can I look after an elderly relative if I am unwell?•How do I volunteer to help in the community?•How can older people protect themselves from scams and people pretending to be from a charity?•How can I claim Universal Credit?•Am I eligible for statutory sick pay?•What if I cannot afford my rent?•What are the best charities to donate to?•How can my business get a bridging loan?That sort of thing; the questions that wouldn't get out of date.And of course we need a really witty film about washing your hands. I'm sure the celebs would help. Indeed we could do lots of little public information films about coronavirus, herd immunity and self-isolation, using our word-class comedic talents - Paul Whitehouse and Harry Enfield; Daisy and Charlie cooper, Rickey Gervais; Jo Brand; Armando Ianucci. Fees to charity, naturally.The Second World War was Long long time ago, another planet as far as modern communications are concerned. Yet they did quite well nonetheless, the old Ministry of Information, with their catchily sloganed posters, homely radio broadcasts and morale boosting movies. One now much-used line, ""Keep Calm and Carry On"" was never actually used, but even now people recognise ""Dig for Victory"", ""Keep Mum"" and ""Careless Talk Costs Lives"". The government budgeted £100 million for a publicity blitz on no deal Brexit last year, leaflets, a massive marketing drive, and propaganda everywhere up to and including motorway signs. Why can't we do the same now?Coronavirus is a fast moving story but some things, such as essential hand hygiene, remain timeless. We need to do it now.

Inexorably, pressure is increasing on the Prime Minister to follow other European nations and introduce draconian measures to beat down the likelihood of mass infection with coronavirus - even if it means a loss of liberty on an unprecedented scale.If there is one principle Johnson holds dear (and he does not have many) it is personal liberty. That, essentially, is why he is a Tory. Or as he put it in a 2006 newspaper column: 'Lefties are fundamentally interested in coercion and control.'Yet now, we are informed, the Government is preparing to 'order' citizens of 70 years of age and over to go into 'quarantine' for no less than four months.It will be said it is for their own good. But it would be a strange sort of quarantine. That term has always described the forcible isolation of those who are actually infected during an epidemic, and who are being put under effective house arrest in order to protect others.FuriousBut this would be an enforced isolation of the uninfected elderly, justified by the figures from Italy, which showed fatalities grotesquely skewed towards those over 70.Throughout his career as a journalist, and as Mayor of London, Johnson has always railed against laws depriving people of liberty for the sake of their own health. He was furious, as Mayor, when the Port of London Authority banned people from swimming in the Thames between the Barrier and Putney Bridge (on the grounds that this was a 'dangerous stretch, with strong tides and eddies').Johnson, a keen fresh-water swimmer himself, raged: 'We don't need some bunch of well-meaning bureaucrats to click their fingers with an edict that sentient adult human beings must be kept out of the river. This is the kind of gratuitous legislation that is sapping the moral fibre of the nation.'In similar terms, he criticised the then Conservative leader David Cameron's support for Jamie Oliver's campaign to make schoolchildren eat healthier food.Some mothers had been seen pushing pies through the railings of a school, so their offspring could continue to have the food they wanted. At a Conservative Party conference fringe meeting, Johnson jibed at Cameron: 'If I was in charge, I would get rid of Jamie Oliver. I say let people eat what they like. Why shouldn't they push pies through the railings?'Most relevantly, in terms of the panic over coronavirus, Johnson told a group of business people in 2007 that as far as he was concerned, Mayor Larry Vaughn was the true hero of the film Jaws: it was 'laudable' that he strove to help the businesses of his seaside town in defiance of mounting hysteria over a number of shark attacks.Johnson acclaimed the fictional Mayor: 'A gigantic fish is eating all [his] constituents and he decides to keep the beach open. It turned out he was wrong. But he was heroically right in principle.'Very funny. But this has serious application to the real-life policy challenge of coronavirus. We could act like the Europeans, shutting down schools, almost all retail outlets, restaurants, you name it. But not only will this cause devastating financial hardship, with the destruction of businesses and countless jobs, it is by no means clear that such extreme measures will lead to fewer deaths, in the medium term, from coronavirus. Without doubt, it will demoralise the population, even if they can be persuaded (which is far from certain) to do exactly as ordered.Few have been putting these points more authoritatively than Susan Michie, 65, a member of the Government's (pre-existing) pandemic influenza advisory committee and Professor of Health Psychology at University College London.On the Andrew Neil Show, on Newsnight, on the World At One, to name just three of the many programmes on which she has appeared in recent days, Professor Michie has supported the Government's policy of relative restraint, with its aim of 'smoothing' the graph of coronavirus cases, rather than trying to stamp it out altogether with radical measures - only to face a sudden spike of infection when people re-emerge and re-congregate.ExtraordinaryWhen Ian Lavery, the hard-Left Labour MP and former President of the National Union of Mineworkers, tweeted that the 'Johnson strategy' meant 'accepting the end of life for many elderly and vulnerable people', Professor Michie tweeted back: 'No, the opposite. The idea is to save the lives of elderly and vulnerable people.'This spectacle of Professor Michie defending Boris Johnson's policies (and therefore those of a Tory government) against the former NUM president is extraordinary. And here's why: although it has never been mentioned in any of the broadcast interviews with the professor, Susan Michie is a leading figure in the tiny British Communist Party, of which she has been a member since 1978.She was previously married to Andrew Murray, who, the Mail reported, 'worked during the Cold War for the Soviet news agency Novosti . . . [and] has written in defence of Stalin and of the despotic totalitarian government of North Korea'.Murray left the Communist Party in order to become an adviser to Jeremy Corbyn. His ex-wife, while remaining in the CP, urged its members to support Corbyn.

I do something every day. My husband and I go ballroom dancing; I go line dancing with friends. I'm certainly going to miss that,' says 76-year-old Dee Tidman","When Matt Hancockannounced over the weekend that everyone over 70 in the UK would soon be asked to stay at home in order to protect themselves from the risk of contracting coronavirus, many of the 12 million people in this age group were taken aback.The Health Secretary said they would need to self-isolate at home for up to four months, acknowledging that it was ""a very big ask"" - but saying it was part of the government's action plan because it would be necessary to protect them.His terminology caused some confusion, leading Scottish officials to stress that elderly people would not be asked to avoid all contact with other people, but rather ""reduce social contact"".But whether it is termed self-isolation or reduced contact with others, the coronavirus outbreak looks set to affect this group in particular, and many over-70s are concerned about the government's approach and the ""mixed messages"" they say are being transmitted from ministers.Professor Karol Sikora, a physician specialising in oncology who is in is 70s, said communication from the government on the issue had been ""appalling"" and accused ministers of ""playing it by ear"".""It makes me think yes, there will be people who are vulnerable and scared and lonely and feel isolated, but hopefully the community will look after these people.""Dee Tidman, 76, who lives with her husband Roger, 75, in Stourbridge in the West Midlands, said she was struggling to come to terms with the fact that she would have to stop taking part in many social activities she enjoys on a regular basis.""I'm a very sociable person. I do something every day. My husband and I go ballroom dancing; I go line dancing with friends. I'm certainly going to miss that. But I am socially distancing already,"" she said. ""I didn't take it seriously until the middle of last week when someone died in our local hospital. That's when I started to feel a bit scared. Things are changing so rapidly. We're all blind to what's going to happen.""Dee Tidman, 76, said she was already reducing her regular social activitiesMs Tidman said over-70s who are still working, such as Mr Tidman, may be the ones that find it most difficult if the self-isolation measures are introduced: ""My husband is still working full-time as an accountant, so it'll hit him probably even more than me because his work keeps him going.""Jan Shortt, general secretary at the National Pensioners Convention, said the organisation had received feedback from many older people concerned about the possibility of the government recommending wide-scale self-isolation for those over 70.She argued that any long period of isolation would inevitably lead to a downward trend in an older persons' physical, mental and emotional health, and said resources must be in place to deal with such outcomes.""There are already those older people living in isolation without family or anyone else to check that they are well and help them if they are not. Others with long-term health conditions are being excluded from their GPs because they have been told to book an appointment online,"" said Ms Shortt.""There is a dilemma regarding the older generation and a balance to be had in the advice given about over 70-year-olds being in isolation for a long period of time. We believe older people are better placed to know their own health needs and will take decisions based on their personal situation. ""The government need a strategy that puts money into the heart of communities (like local councils, local GPs, hospitals, clinics) to monitor those over 75 and ensure that their daily needs are met.""Professor Robert Dingwall, professor of sociology at Nottingham Trent University, who is a member of two of the expert groups that are advising the UK government on its coronavirus response, said the message needed an ""injection of common sense"".He continued: ""If you have a dog, take it out for walks - but don't stop to hang out with other dog walkers. If you usually walk down to the local convenience store, keep doing that - just pick a quiet time to do it.""Maybe the supermarkets could be asked to set aside a morning each week - or a couple of hours every day - when their shelves will be fully stocked and entrance restricted to over 70s and necessary companions.""We do not need draconian and potentially inhumane interventions to achieve most of the collective goals here, just to consider some fairly basic social and behavioural science questions. Trusting individuals to make their own risk assessments and devise their own solutions is likely to achieve much more than arbitrary and confrontational exercises of state power. Self-isolation must not turn into self-imprisonment.""",Newspaper; Web Publication
144,"Can Boris Johnson conjure up the spirit of the Blitz? As the coronavirus crisis worsens, the challenge and risks confronting the Prime Minister are Churchillian in magnitude, writes SIMON WALTERS","March 16, 2020 Monday",International,MailOnline,940,940,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,Simon Walters for the Daily Mail,"Can Boris Johnson conjure up the spirit of the Blitz? As the coronavirus crisis worsens, the challenge and risks confronting the Prime Minister are Churchillian in magnitude, writes SIMON WALTERS","                     Boris Johnson did not draw a direct parallel with the threat posed to Britain by coronavirus and that of the Blitz in 1940. But at his Downing Street press conference yesterday he struck the dark, serious tone of a man putting the nation on a war footing.And he was addressing people already coming to terms with the crisis, and many who had already absented themselves from normal life as shown by the deserted train stations, empty tracks and carriages and abandoned motorways in and around London and major cities.We huddled round televisions or computer screens to listen to the Prime Minister - just as our parents and grandparents might have gathered round the wireless to listen to Johnson's hero, Winston Churchill, in the Second World War.For once Johnson the compulsive showman resisted the urge to make a wisecrack. He spoke solemnly and carefully.When he became Prime Minister last July, it seemed certain his term in office would be defined by one thing: Brexit.It is a mark of the scale of the coronavirus crisis that Brexit suddenly seems irrelevant. The Brexit talks could stall for years, hit the economy hard, or fail to curb immigration and Johnson could still expect to see out his five year term, albeit diminished in stature. But if the critics who say he is doing too little late to combat coronavirus are proved right, and thousands die needlessly as a result of his miscalculation, he could be evicted from No 10 by the end of the year.So comparing coronavirus to the Blitz is not as fanciful as it may seem.It was in June 1940 that Churchill made his 'their finest hour' speech, rallying the nation behind him. He had been Prime Minister for just one month.Those words prepared frightened Britons for the struggle ahead and its inspiration kept them going right through the war. But Churchill owes his place in history not just to rhetoric.Time and again, he made the right decision, often in the face of opposition from military experts and fellow Allied leaders. In recent days Johnson has faced criticism at home and abroad for his failure last week to order more drastic measures. This was compounded by a series of cackhanded, contradictory announcements in the following days.On Friday morning, the Chief Scientific Officer Sir Patrick Vallance said there was no need to scrap big sporting events: within hours Premiership football bosses took unilateral action to postpone matches until April. Then a Government adviser David Halpern suggested 'herd immunity' was official policy, meaning it was necessary for more than half the population to be infected.Health Secretary Matt Hancock had to be deployed at the weekend to say loud and clear that the main aim was to ensure people did not get the virus.Next it leaked out via a blog by ITV's Robert Peston that the over-70s would have to stay indoors for four months - and could not even take the dog for a walk.This time it was Transport Secretary Grant Shapps came to the rescue with the welcome news that the elderly can still take Rover - and themselves - for a daily 'constitutional' and visits are not vetoed.As it turns out, the new and more restrictive measures announced by Johnson yesterday brings us closer into line with the rest of Europe - with one notable exception. He is sticking to his refusal to order school closures.I have no doubt this is endorsed by the Praetorian Guard flanking him again yesterday, the reassuringly calm and considered Chief Medical Officer Chris Whitty and Sir Patrick, and by the evidence.Equally, this would have been Johnson's own very strong gut instinct and he is a man, we know, who likes to go with his gut.Often he is right.It is, however, a lonely place that he finds himself in and some of Johnson's most recent predecessors in No 10 were similarly subjected to early tests of their crisis handling capabilities - and, whatever their subsequent shortcomings, came through well.Tony Blair captured the nation's mood with his 'People's Princess' response to Diana's death four months after coming to power in 1997.Gordon Brown played a pivotal role in the global response to the financial crash of 2008, while Theresa May won similar plaudits for her strong denunciation of Russia over the 2018 poisoning of double agent Sergei Skripal in Salisbury.The stakes for Johnson are, of course, much higher than they were for Blair, Brown or May.The EU referendum and election landslide proved his ability to lead and inspire. They also showed the courage and vision to go against the grain - and be proved right.No one thought he would have the nerve to defy Prime Minister David Cameron and lead the Brexit campaign in 2016: he did.No one thought he would win that campaign: he did.No one thought he would become Prime Minister and deliver Brexit: he did.No one gave him a hope of winning by a landslide in December: he did.It can't all be luck, though every successful political and military leader needs it.The challenge and the risks confronting Johnson now are truly Churchillian in magnitude. He will need every ounce of judgment, good advice - and yes, luck, he can summon.But he will need even more than that.In his 2014 biography of Churchill, Johnson said one of his greatest qualities was his 'megalopsychia'It is the Ancient Greek phrase for 'great-souled man' and was Aristotle's definition of virtue.Johnson will need that same noble virtue to retain public support as he leads his 'fightback' against coronavirus in the testing times that lie ahead.•The Borisaurus: The Dictionary of Boris Johnson,by Simon Walters is published on 9th April, by Biteback Publishing, priced £12.99.",Web Publication

Teachers and pupils with underlying health conditions have been advised to stay at home, but all others are expected to attend.Evidence on Covid-19 suggests that children do not experience severe illness, and closing schools can be disruptive for children and parents.Ms Sturgeon said there was ""considerable discussion"" about schools at Cobra, the UK government's emergency resilience committee, last night.Speaking after the committee, Ms Sturgeon told journalists: ""The advice right now is that schools are not being closed on a blanket basis. It is better now to keep them open, principally for public health reasons associated with children themselves, but also protecting the frontline workforce.""We do recognise . . . that there will be teachers and children themselves who are within the vulnerable group categories that we are setting out today, and that will have an impact.

147,Coronavirus strategy tests UK's reputation for science,"March 17, 2020 Tuesday",International,"Financial Times (London, England)",650,650,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,Anjana Ahuja,Coronavirus strategy tests UK's reputation for science,"T he Chinese practice of variolation must have made little sense to 18th-century Englanders. It involved giving children small scratches and then rubbing the broken skin with powder ground from smallpox scabs.The resulting mild infection protected most children against the fullblown disease (though it killed some too). Variolation - so named because smallpox is spread by the variola virus - was the first step towards the safer practice of vaccination.The fact that a theory is counter-intuitive does not necessarily mean it is wrong. It does, however, demand that those championing it explain carefully why they think it is better than the common sense alternative. The UK government, having initially adopted a more laissez-faire management style to coronavirus than other European countries, has found itself in a bind - although more draconian measures are being announced on an almost hourly basis.Britain's European neighbours, already approaching the eye of the Covid-19 storm, had been looking on in horror. The World Health Organization urged countries not to abandon containment, testing and contact tracing. The diligent application of that advice has worked in Singapore and Hong Kong.The British government has accepted that community transmission is inevitable. Testing for Covid-19 will happen in hospital, meaning that only the most severe infections will be included in official case numbers. Ministers must be unsparingly transparent about the science behind its reasoning.The role of government, as it faces down this unpredictable threat, is not only to protect life but also to keep society functioning as far as possible. That means using the best science available to inform political decisions. Fortunately, world-class expertise in epidemiology, virology, immunology and mathematical modelling can be found in British universities.That knowledge makes its way to ministers via the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies. It must then be synthesised into a political judgment: how to minimise harm while maintaining, as far as possible, the economy and public confidence. Even in a pandemic - perhaps especially so then - some semblance of life must continue. Food supply chains must function; hospitals and care facilities need to operate at full steam. In order to keep hospitals staffed, schools need to stay open if feasible. In any case, schools act as informal quarantines - and provide a psychologically comforting routine. The instinct to shut society down, as China did with Wuhan, is not cost-free when it comes to public health. Maxwell Smith, an ethicist at Western University in Ontario, points out that compulsory quarantine, school closures and a disrupted economy inflict social damage that can affect health further down the line. ""China will feel the effects [of a shutdown] for years,"" he said. ""There were millions of people not in the workforce and not in school. That can change people's socio-economic status.""

151,"How do we face coronavirus? Common decency is our only hope;Whether you're a catastrophist or a conspiracy theorist, everyone has their own way of coping with the pandemic. But what we really need is solidarity and honestySee all our coronavirus coverage","March 17, 2020 Tuesday",International,The Guardian (London),970,970,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,Suzanne Moore,"How do we face coronavirus? Common decency is our only hopeWhether you're a catastrophist or a conspiracy theorist, everyone has their own way of coping with the pandemic. But what we really need is solidarity and honestySee all our coronavirus coverage","How do you feel? I'm not asking if you have a temperature and a cough. What I mean is: how do you feel in yourself? How are you coping emotionally? I ask because, since we have all become amateur and (frankly, quite crap) epidemiologists, we have been ignoring what really matters. Because so much of what happens next in the coronavirus crisis depends on our emotional responses.I was ill last week, and pretty much self-isolated. Easy enough for me - it's something I have done for 20 years anyway as a freelance writer. But when I did go out, I saw restaurants that were packed with people, and chatted on the bus to a 76-year-old who was full of beans, despite having just come out of hospital, having had pneumonia. She was not going to stop living her life, she told me, and she wouldn't be doing anything she was being advised to do. No self-isolation for her.I wonder if she will be arrested for being so sparky, when the new police powers that have been floated come in. She may well be in denial. That's how the whole of the UK apparently looks to the rest of Europe. Denial is about not wanting to feel afraid or not feeling entitled to voice fear. What works in such a situation is to say that, yes, we are all afraid and it is OK to be afraid. To admit to that is one of the steps that will help us get through this.The reality is that for any self-isolation or quarantine to work, we need to be willing - even if just for now - to be compliant. And that depends on a level of emotional intelligence that seems to be severely lacking in our culture.Slagging off Boris Johnson seems another form of denial. Would Jeremy Corbyn be doing any better? If scoring party-political points at a time like this is your priority, you have the incurable virus of self-righteousness. Sorry. People will die in huge numbers, and it is true, of course, that inequality and austerity kills. This is not new information, but this virus is new and how we behave cannot be based on how we behaved three months or even three days ago. We don't have enough ventilators, hospital beds or the testing that seems more important than ever in how we move forward; arguing and point-scoring won't help with those essential, urgent practicalities.The resilience of those who refuse to change their behaviour after a terror attack - the people who go out anyway - is absolutely no use here. The virus doesn't care about your bravery, your politics or your views on globalisation. It doesn't care if you trust the government or hate Brexit.It doesn't matter if you are a catastrophist (""it's the end times"") or a conspiracy theorist (""this is a cull of those we can't pay for any more""). What matters now is whether people will take the only advice there is: scrupulous hand-washing and self-isolation.There is all sorts of nonsense being talked about the blitz spiritSome things we know will help. When people are in terrifying situations - say, in the military - it helps to give them lots of things to do. Activity can help conquer fear. Loneliness stresses the immune system, so if our old people are to be isolated, we at least have the tech now to connect. Teach your elderly folk how to Skype.The mad scramble for toilet paper is understandable, as it allows people to feel that they are responding to a crisis - that they are therefore mid-crisis - and able to imagine a time when the crisis ends. But it is no more helpful than the opposite response: keep calm and carry on. There is all sorts of nonsense being talked about the blitz spirit, all of which ignores the fact that during the blitz many people had breakdowns and suffered what we now call post-traumatic stress disorder.Behavioural science can tell us only so much, just as data science has its limitations. There are those, though, who have studied people's reactions to disaster. Sandro Galea, the dean of the Boston University School of Public Health, has written about the five stages of reaction, which I will summarise here as: 1) self-preservation: fear and anxiety; 2) group preservation, where changes in social behaviour begin; 3) blame-setting: the psychological consequences fall into place as we realise we have to change our normal activities; 4) justice-seeking: we want to see what and who caused the disaster; 5) renormalising - basically, we have adapted to the crisis and its consequences.As with stages of grief, these processes are not linear, but, right now, we are at stage one. Indeed, we have to legitimise fear in order to make necessary changes.There is no going back to pre-virus times. Priorities will have to be reordered. Not all work matters that much. Not all flights have to be taken. Those in authority have very little. The NHS and its staff is the most precious resource this country has. No one will doubt that again.We need now to create community at a distance; a new way of being - and please no one else send me that video of Italians bloody singing. What helps you may not help me. And vice versa.Let us have our own individual responses and anxieties, because this is how we adapt to the new normal. I don't yet know what this is any more than you do. Living with uncertainty is hard, but uncertainty has been the emotional pandemic of recent years anyway.Those who know anything for sure right now are precisely those that I trust the least. I reread The Plague last week, in between necking paracetamol and arguing on Twitter. My God, Camus is great.""There's no question of heroism in all this,"" he writes. ""It's a matter of common decency. That's an idea which may make some people smile, but the only means of fighting a plague is - common decency.""Will common decency survive the virus? Will we find it within ourselves? I don't know, but that seems to me the only vaccine we have. Suzanne Moore is a Guardian columnist",Newspaper

""I'm still on for 7pm, I hope you have coronavirus because I want herd immunity,"" messaged my friend on Saturday. It didn't sound like the most enticing offer. I shared my mental micro-calculations about the risk with my boyfriend - which he countered by saying the pubs are still open, I'd been saying I wanted a pint and if we washed our hands and didn't touch our faces we'd be fine (we've been having an extended heated discussion/argument about what is and isn't paranoid regularly since the virus broke out and it usually ends with one of us going off in a huff, which bodes badly if we have to self-isolate together, or cocoon as it's been rebranded).

Not quite as exciting as the cup final. No wonder we are all obsessing over scouring the shops for the last tin of beans; it feels like the only action we can take.

Benita's ending the race with good grace                   I spent an hour interviewing Liberal Democrat mayoral candidate Siobhan Benita last week.As we ate mozzarella and tomato salad on an outside table at Bar Italia in Soho, we talked about what she'd do if she was elected - including her plans for express bus routes - and how making kind decisions in politics is harder than it sounds. When she started at the Civil Service it took her three months to feel confident enough to tell her manager that, as the only person in the office who didn't go to private school, she didn't understand the notes he wrote to her in Latin - he had just assumed that she spoke it. This made her determined to attract people from a wider range of backgrounds to politics. But now her plans are on hold for a year because of the elections being postponed due to coronavirus. Benita, pictured, and her fellow candidates have taken this in good spirits, with far more grace than the frustrated journalists who transcribed interviews with them that now won't run.                     Beard bans                   A bit of light relief is creeping through. There are videos of self-isolation with dogs on TikTok (I should have got one before this began), Instagram is full of pictures of spring blossom and NHS workers are having to consult a guide to which beards are the most hygienic.There are 36 different varieties, with formidable names, and only 13 are safe. A friend has spent months cultivating what the chart calls The Garibaldi and has had to trim it down to The Zorro to prevent the spread of disease. The permitted beards are less appealing - you might be allowed in a hospital with the Soul Patch but on aesthetic grounds I'd argue that they aren't a good idea anywhere else. They are also known as jazz dots or lady pleasers. Eew.",Newspaper; Web Publication

154,"Call to protect hospital staff from coronavirus contamination;Warning after contamination found across Wuhan hospital, with virus on much equipment Coronavirus - latest updatesSee all our coronavirus coverage","March 17, 2020 Tuesday",International,The Guardian (London),595,595,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,Ian Sample Science editor,"Call to protect hospital staff from coronavirus contaminationWarning after contamination found across Wuhan hospital, with virus on much equipment Coronavirus - latest updatesSee all our coronavirus coverage","Scientists have issued an urgent call to protect health workers in hospitals after finding ""extensive"" levels of coronavirus contamination in specialist wards and intensive-care units and on equipment ranging from keyboards to gel hand sanitisers.The widespread contamination was revealed by more than 600 swabs taken throughout a major hospital in Wuhan, China, as the outbreak swept through the city in February, with patients and visitors filling the wards and nearby waiting areas.Despite extra cleaning procedures that were introduced at the 3,000-bed Zhongnan medical centre at Wuhan University, researchers found significant contamination in intensive care units and obstetric wards caring for people with the virus, where nearly one-third of swabs tested positive.A fifth of swabs from wards used to isolate coronavirus patients were also contaminated, along with 17% of swabs from the outpatient lobby. More than a 10th of the swabs from the emergency department and clinical labs bore traces of the virus.The scientists found substantial contamination on common hospital equipment too. Tests on swabs taken from hand sanitisers and self-service printers that patients use to print out copies of their medical reports found that 20% tested positive. Keyboards, doorknobs and desktops also harboured the virus, with 16% to 17% of swabs containing traces of the germ. One in eight telephone swabs also tested positive.The researchers, led by Xinghuan Wang at the hospital, describe the findings as "" an urgent call "" to protect healthcare workers. ""These findings suggest that the hospital environment could potentially be a source of virus spread, including among healthcare workers, patients and visitors,"" their report states, adding that the results emphasised the pressing need to ensure adequate environmental cleaning and infection prevention training among healthcare workers during the outbreak.Coronavirus is spread primarily by droplets that are coughed or sneezed into the air by people who have the infection. But the global movement that is under way to encourage regular and effective handwashing aims to reduce infections that are spread by touching contaminated surfaces.According to the study, the highest levels of contamination found in Zhongnan should inform others about the most effective cleaning and disinfection procedures.Susan Michie, a professor of health psychology at University College London, said there was no reason for hospitals to be contaminated if they had enough staff and resources. But in many cases they did not, she added.""We are starting on the back foot. We are not in a good place because of the austerity measures. In order to keep everything really clean you need to have staff paying attention, so you need to have enough staff. This is where contamination will creep in,"" she said.Dr Sian Williams, a consultant in occupational medicine in London, said it was vital for healthcare workers to be protected, but infection-control teams were often underresourced. One problem, she said, was the spread of keyboards and other technologies that are difficult to sterilise. ""There are keyboards that can be wiped clean easily and some hospitals have those in A&E. But there hasn't been a push [to expand their use] because we haven't had this situation in the past,"" she said.UK hospitals may face further problems because many hospitals use contract cleaners who do not get paid for the first three days they are ill. ""If they develop a cough, these people won't be able to afford to stay away and self-isolate,"" she said.",Newspaper
155,CAN BORIS CONJURE UP SPIRIT OF THE BLITZ?,"March 17, 2020 Tuesday",International,The Daily Mail and Mail on Sunday (London),709,709,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,,CAN BORIS CONJURE UP SPIRIT OF THE BLITZ?,"COMMENTARYBY SIMON WALTERSBoris Johnson did not draw a direct parallel with the threat posed to Britain by coronavirus and that of the Blitz in 1940. But at his Downing Street press conference yesterday he struck the dark, serious tone of a man putting the nation on a war footing.And he was addressing people already coming to terms with the crisis, and many who had already absented themselves from normal life as shown by the deserted train stations, empty tracks and carriages and abandoned motorways.We huddled round televisions or computer screens to listen to the Prime Minister - just as our parents and grandparents might have gathered round the wireless to listen to Johnson's hero, Winston Churchill, in the Second World War.For once Johnson the compulsive showman resisted the urge to make a wisecrack. He spoke solemnly and carefully.When he became Prime Minister last July, it seemed certain his term in office would be defined by one thing: Brexit.It is a mark of the scale of the coronavirus crisis that Brexit suddenly seems irrelevant. The Brexit talks could stall for years, hit the economy hard, or fail to curb immigration and Johnson could still expect to see out his five year term, albeit diminished in stature. But if the critics who say he is doing too little, too late to combat coronavirus are proved right, and thousands die needlessly as a result of his miscalculation, he could be evicted from No 10 by the new year.So comparing coronavirus to the Blitz is not as fanciful as it may seem.It was in June 1940 that Churchill made his their finest hour' speech, rallying the nation behind him. He had been Prime Minister for just one month.Those words prepared scared Britons for the struggle ahead and its inspiration kept them going. But Churchill owes his place in history not just to rhetoric.Time and again, he made the right decision, often in the face of opposition from military experts and fellow Allied leaders. In recent days Johnson has faced criticism at home and abroad for his failure last week to order more drastic measures. This was compounded by a series of cackhanded, contradictory announcements in the following days.On Friday morning, the Chief Scientific Officer Sir Patrick Vallance said there was no need to scrap big sporting events: within hours Premiership football bosses took unilateral action to postpone matches until April. Then Government adviser David Halpern suggested herd immunity' was official policy, meaning it was necessary for more than half the population to be infected.Health Secretary Matt Hancock had to be deployed at the weekend to say loud and clear that the main aim was to ensure people did not get the virus.Next it leaked that the over-70s would have to stay indoors for four months - deprived of visitors and could not even take the dog for a walk. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps came to the rescue with news that the elderly can still take Rover - and themselves - for a daily constitutional' and visits are not vetoed.The new, more restrictive measures announced by Johnson yesterday bring us closer in line with the rest of Europe - with one notable exception. He is refusing to order school closures. I have no doubt this is endorsed by the reassuringly calm and considered Chief Medical Officer Chris Whitty and Sir Patrick, and by the evidence. Equally, this would have been Johnson's own very strong gut instinct and he is a man, we know, who likes to go with his gut. Often he is right.The EU referendum and election landslide proved his ability to lead and inspire. They also showed the courage to go against the grain, and be proved right. The challenge and risks confronting Johnson are Churchillian in magnitude.He will need every ounce of judgment, good advice and luck he can summon. But he will need even more than that. In his 2014 biography of Churchill, Johnson said one of his greatest qualities was his megalopsychia', the Ancient Greek phrase for great-souled man'.Johnson will need that same noble virtue to retain public support as he leads his fightback' against coronavirus in the testing times that lie ahead.The Borisaurus: The Dictionary of Boris Johnson by Simon Walters is published April 9, by Biteback Publishing, at £12.99.© Daily Mail",Papers
156,"Pantomime clown Boris Johnson flounders as crisis deepens;Hopelessly out of his depth, PM is levitas incarnate as he addresses half-empty Commons","March 18, 2020 Wednesday",International,The Guardian (London),892,892,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,John Crace,"Pantomime clown Boris Johnson flounders as crisis deepensHopelessly out of his depth, PM is levitas incarnate as he addresses half-empty Commons","The Labour benches had already long since stopped cheering on their leader at prime minister's questions, but now the Tories have also fallen silent. This is politics in the time of coronavirus. No braying. No waving of order papers. No wild acclaim for the repetition of mindless soundbites. The silence of MPs breaking the habit of a lifetime and trying to treat one another with respect and leading by example.Not that there were many MPs. For what is normally a guaranteed full house, there were barely 100 members in the chamber, all of whom were trying to maintain a safe distance from one another. And on Tory faces there were growing flickers of concern. Choosing Boris Johnson as their leader suddenly wasn't looking like such a good idea. Boris is a good-time party guy. The sort of man who can be the life and soul of the Olympics and be relied on for any upbeat bollocks about Brexit.But Boris just can't do the serious stuff. He is levitas incarnate. A man with an unbearable lightness of being. At a time of national crisis, the country wants a man who is willing to put in the hard yards. Who can be bothered to read briefing papers longer than two sides of A4.What's more, deep down, Boris knows he is floundering. That he is hopelessly out of his depth. Up till now he's always got away with somehow coming up with the right words. The master of the glib. A catchphrase for every occasion. Now though, those same words are dying in his throat. They don't even convince him, let alone the other members of the cabinet. Rishi Sunak and Michael Gove could barely look at him. Liz Truss was lost in a world of her own. But then she often is.The pantomime clown with the pantomime hair has morphed into a pantomime villain. Someone even children can identify as inherently untrustworthy. And it's taking its toll. Over the last few weeks - since he first got round to taking the pandemic seriously - he has aged years. His eyes are red and puffy, his complexion pallid and the bags deepening into furrows. At night he weeps, though mostly for himself. Of all the gin joints in all of the towns in all of the world, why did he have to walk into this one?This may well have been Jeremy Corbyn's last PMQs, if rumours that parliament might shut for ordinary business at the end of the week are true or self-isolation for the over-70s is brought in at the weekend. If it is, then at least he can say he went out on a high, for his questions struck just the right tone and manner. While promising to work with the government in doing whatever was required, he pointed to some abject failures in the government response. Why couldn't statutory sick pay be raised to EU levels? Were families really meant to get by on £90 per week? What about those on zero-hours contracts? What about those who couldn't pay the rent? And why wasn't more being done to test NHS workers - as well as the rest of the population - and provide more vitally needed protective clothing and ventilators?Unusually, the Tory benches were just as keen - if not more so - to hear the answers. Because up till now most of Johnson's public announcements have been somewhat on the vague side, and their constituents are just as concerned as Labour's. Trying to convince the country that the UK's science is miles ahead of the rest of the world's science hadn't been a spectacular success, and it's often felt like the rest of the country has been streets ahead of the government in its preparations for coronavirus. Just suggesting that people might like not go to pubs too often is hardly groundbreaking advice. Even if it does help bail out the insurance industry. Important to have your priorities right.Here Boris unwisely felt himself to be on stronger ground. The government had been doing a brilliant job by employing the nudge economics of such superb super-forecasters as Dominic Cummings and Steve Hilton, who have so far managed to get just about every forecast wrong. The thing was, these geniuses had managed to subvert nudge theory into turning it on its head. Long live the weirdos and the misfits. The model the government was using was to do nothing and just wait until everyone introduced sensible panic measures of their own. Then once the public had done its job for it it, the government would then be nudged into turning it into official policy. Ideal for the Boris with No Clothes, who couldn't face the responsibility of decision making.Every question was on the coronavirus and the longer the session progressed, the more Tories began to further self-isolate from Boris. His answers on protective wear, ventilators and widespread testing sounded borderline delusional. How can one man have done so little when NHS staff have been begging him to do more for weeks? The prime minister couldn't even bring himself to contemplate a possible extension to the Brexit transition. Imagine it. When the country might be economically on its knees, we have a prime minister happy to bankrupt it completely just to keep the rightwing Brexiters on board.There were no answers on closures of schools either, despite several questions on them. Looks like the plan is to be nudged into doing it later after Scotland and Wales have taken the lead. It won't be long before cities are in lockdown. A policy many people have already taken for themselves. Lions led by donkeys.",Newspaper
157,Strategy shift Control measures take on added urgency,"March 18, 2020 Wednesday",International,"Financial Times (London, England)",1043,1043,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,CLIVE COOKSON ;SEBASTIAN PAYNE,Strategy shift Control measures take on added urgency,"Coronavirus cases are increasing at an exponential rate, reaching 1,950 yesterday with 71 deaths and more than doubling every five to six days. In response to the growing global health crisis the government introduced measures on Monday that went far further than those taken late last week.The new plan A string of ""social distancing"" measures designed to keep people apart. Boris Johnson, prime minister, urged people to avoid gatherings with friends and family and not to go to crowded places, such as pubs, clubs and theatres. People should work from home if possible and avoid non-essential travel.People living in the same household as a person with a persistent cough or fever are told to stay at home for 14 days. They should go out to get essential supplies only if no one else can - and then minimise any social contact.People should use the overloaded health service only when necessary - and then if possible by obtaining information from the NHS website rather than calling the 111 health advice line.Mr Johnson warned that by this coming weekend ""it will be necessary to go further and to ensure that those with the most serious health conditions are largely shielded from social contact for around 12 weeks"". This is likely to apply to people aged over 70 as well.Shift in strategy A big change from the prime minister's plans set out in his March 9 press conference when he said: ""As things stand I'm afraid it bears repeating that the best thing we can all do is wash our hands for 20 seconds with soap and water.""Some Conservative MPs are concerned by the abrupt change in strategy.""They have changed their policy, whatever they say. It was all going well until last Thursday, but now the whole thing is a disaster,"" said one senior backbencher.Why not harder, faster? One factor was that psychologists and behavioural scientists were advising the government that stringent social distancing imposed too soon might make people tire of the restrictions and begin mixing again just when it was most important for them to remain isolated.This view has apparently been largely swept aside by overwhelming new medical and scientific evidence in favour of much stronger action.However, government insiders insist that the strategy has not changed. ""There has always been a plan, guided by science, which would see us moving through different phases,"" said one official. ""As we learn more about the virus - from Italy and on the ground here - we have made determinations guided by the evidence.""What caused the change? The biggest factor was bad news from Italy and experience from UK hospitals treating Covid-19 patients in recent days. It now appears that the intensive care requirements will be nearly twice as high as the NHS had previously assumed on the basis of previous experience with viral pneumonia. The latest evidence suggested that 30 per cent of patients hospitalised with coronavirus would need to be looked after in an intensive care unit. When epidemiologists at Imperial College and the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, who are advising the government, fed new data into their computer models, it became evident the NHS would be overwhelmed unless the policy was changed. Even assuming all patients would receive treatment, the researchers concluded there could be as many as 250,000 deaths. The government now hopes to limit deaths to thousands or tens of thousands.Political pressure also played a significant role. Jeremy Hunt, the longest serving health secretary, was the first prominent Conservative to voice public concerns about the initial strategy.Privately other Tory MPs have been making their views known to Downing Street. One senior MP said there was a ""huge amount of private pressure, but no one felt able to criticise the government when chief medical and scientific officers speak. We're not experts and we're trying not to scare folk.""Do the measures go far enough? Although Mr Johnson said on Monday that ""many people may feel ... that there is something excessive about these measures"", they are quite relaxed in comparison with other European countries. In particular, the UK measures are largely voluntary while others have introduced more compulsion.Many scientists are urging stronger UK measures. Alan McNally, microbiology professor at the University of Birmingham, said: ""My belief has not changed in that we should have complete cessation of all public gatherings and social distancing. Positive patients should be isolated and there needs to be a sustained practice of testing, including priority testing for healthcare workers.""Whitehall officials said all actions were guided by the scientific advice and tougher recommendations would be implemented as and when required.Schools and colleges Ministers have not spelt out why they have not yet closed all educational establishments, in contrast with almost every other European country.Health experts say school closure would reduce the capacity of the NHS by forcing staff to stay at home to look after their children.With many schools and universities under pressure as staff take time off to self isolate, a blanket closure is expected soon. Mr Johnson and his advisers have been clear that the measure needs to be taken at the moment when it would have the maximum effect in tackling the spread of the virus.Is the UK testing enough? South Korea's success in slowing the spread of coronavirus has been attributed by some scientists to its extensive programme in which more than 270,000 people were tested.Although ministers plan to step up testing - Patrick Vallance, the chief scientific adviser, told MPs yesterday he was pushing for a big increase - only 10,000 tests are being carried out a day, focused on patients ill enough to be in hospital. A lack of testing kits has forced the government to prioritise.Prof McNally said the UK needs ""rapid testing for active infection for all persons showing respiratory symptoms. This is an enormous task but can be achieved by mobilising academic laboratories alongside public health and hospital laboratories, especially if we want to determine scale of transmission and infection in the community.""'It was all going well until last Thursday, but now the whole thing is a disaster'",Newspaper
158,"If the UK wants to act out of step, it must explain why","March 18, 2020",International,i - Independent Print Ltd,639,639,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,Anjana Ahuja,"If the UK wants to act out of step, it must explain why","The Chinese practice of variolation must have made little sense to 18th-century Englanders. It involved giving children small scratches and then rubbing the broken skin with powder ground from smallpox scabs. The resulting mild infection protected most children against the full-blown disease (though it killed some too).Variolation - so named because smallpox is spread by the variola virus - was the first step towards the safer practice of vaccination. The fact that a theory is counterintuitive does not necessarily mean it is wrong. It does, however, demand that those championing it explain carefully why they think it is better than the common sense alternative.The UK Government, having initially adopted a more laissez-faire management style to coronavirus than other European countries, has found itself in a bind - although more draconian measures are being announced on an almost hourly basis. Britain's European neighbours, already approaching the eye of the Covid-19 storm, had been looking on in horror.The World Health Organisation urged countries not to abandon containment, testing and contact tracing. The diligent application of that advice has worked in Singapore and Hong Kong. The British Government has accepted that community transmission is inevitable. Testing for Covid-19 will happen in hospital, meaning that only the most severe infections will be included in official case numbers.Ministers must be unsparingly transparent about the science behind its reasoning. The role of government, as it faces down this unpredictable threat, is not only to protect life but also to keep society functioning as far as possible. That means using the best science available to inform political decisions.Fortunately, world-class expertise in epidemiology, virology, immunology and mathematical modelling can be found in British universities. That knowledge makes its way to ministers via the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies. It must then be synthesised into a political judgment: how to minimise harm while maintaining, as far as possible, the economy and public confidence.Even in a pandemic - perhaps especially so then - some semblance of life must continue. Food supply chains must function; hospitals and care facilities need to operate at full steam. In order to keep hospitals staffed, schools need to stay open if feasible. In any case, schools act as informal quarantines - and provide a psychologically comforting routine.The instinct to shut society down, as China did with Wuhan, is not cost-free when it comes to public health. Maxwell Smith, an ethicist at Western University in Ontario, points out that compulsory quarantine, school closures and a disrupted economy inflict social damage that can affect health further down the line.""China will feel the effects [of a shutdown] for years,"" he said. ""There were millions of people not in the workforce and not in school. That can change people's socio-economic status.""A 2017 analysis suggested low socio-economic status is correlated with early death. The behavioural science aspect to the UK coronavirus response, though, looks shakier. When ministers decreed last week that life should carry on as normal, many people did the opposite. The loss of public trust, epitomised by supermarket shelves stripped bare, is concerning if the national strategy hinges on public compliance. Those pushing a vision of Global Britain have long wagered that the country's exceptional reputation in science and technology will unlock a glittering economic and political future. That belief underpins the Budget announcement of an £800m research agency, specialising in high-risk, highreward ideas.The UK's distinctive national response to Covid-19 will test that theory of scientific exceptionalism to destruction.ARTICLE REPUBLISHED FROM THE FINANCIAL TIMES",Newspaper

164,Coronavirus: Government devises plan to stop people touching their faces;Public Health England says it is one of the biggest ways to slow the spread of the virus,"March 19, 2020 Thursday",International,The Independent (United Kingdom),461,461,England & Wales,Sophie Gallagher,Coronavirus: Government devises plan to stop people touching their facesPublic Health England says it is one of the biggest ways to slow the spread of the virus,"Government ministers have been advised on how to successfully ensure people adopt policies like not touching their face, amid the ongoing coronavirus outbreak in the UK.The continued rise in Covid-19 cases has prompted a raft of advice from the government, Public Health England and the NHS on how to slow the virus spread.It includes washing your hands more frequently, coughing or sneezing into a tissue and then putting it in the bin, and -crucially -not touching your face.The Behavioural Insights Team, a company part-owned by the Cabinet Office, has shared a blogpost online of the advice it is giving ministers around face touching.It's something people are thought to do more than 15 times an hour on average. Even in intensive care units studies have observed healthcare workers touching their face around five times an hour.                     It says: ""The issue is that much of this face touching is likely to be outside our conscious control.""And says that many people will not have ""mental models"" for stopping face touching, unlike hand washing where we can watch other humans demonstrate.It recommends that the government instead suggest ""substitute behaviours"" so instead of touching your face with your hands, try instead with the back of your wrist or arm as this is less likely to have been exposed to infection than your fingers.But if you are touching your face in an ""unprompted way"" (e.g. not in response to an itch or a sneeze) and more as an unconscious habit then you'll need to try different tactics.The BIT recommends getting members of your family or friends to say ""face"" or similar every time you touch your face as a type of social reinforcement. Alternatively it recommends keeping your hands in your pockets, holding your hands together or folding your arms in a ""locked way"" (grabbing the opposing bicep).It also suggests developing alternative habits such as drumming your fingers on your legs or playing with a ball. For many people picking up a habit like washing your hands for longer (20 seconds or as long as it takes to sing Happy Birthday twice) is fairly simple - but changing a subconscious habit like touching your face is proving much harder.Staff with the Behavioural Insights Team are continuing to test these messages to see which has the biggest impact on population behaviour. Prime Minister Boris Johnson advised on Monday that social distancing was going to become a bigger priority for the UK as he advised people to work from home and not do any non-essential travel. This includes not socialising, visiting pubs, bars, restaurants or theatres.In London, pubs, restaurants, cinemas, gyms and leisure centres in London will be told later today that they must close their doors to slow the spread of the virus.

He is known as inmate No 20B0584.The prison, six hours by car from Manhattan, is likely to be a temporary stop for Weinstein. While he is there, he will be evaluated to determine which state prison facility meets his security, medical, mental health and other needs. Weinstein, who was convicted in February and sentenced last week, had been switching between New York City's notorious Rikers Island jail complex and a Manhattan hospital.It is thought his prison processing could last as long as 60 days. Herbert Morales, a fellow at the Correctional Association of New York and a former inmate who gained a degree in behavioural science behind bars, said new inmates like Weinstein were required to hand over their property before being given a shower, shaved and ""de-liced"". ""He'll get boots, sneakers, three pairs of state pants, four pairs of state shirts, a state coat, several pairs of state underwear, several T-shirts,"" Mr Morales told Page Six.Weinstein had left court in an ambulance after the guilty verdict and was sent to Bellevue Hospital complaining of chest pains. He later had a stent inserted to unblock an artery.The Oscar-winning producer of Shakespeare In Love was convicted of third-degree rape against an aspiring actress in 2013 and a first-degree criminal sexual act on a film production assistant in 2006.

168,Coronavirus scientific advice -from hospital risk for under-50s to why schools are shut;The response to this virus is going to change how we all live our lives for the next few months -but now the government has released some of the advice that led them to make their decisions,"March 20, 2020 Friday",International,mirror.co.uk,1761,1761,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,"By, Dan Bloom & Oliver Milne",Coronavirus scientific advice -from hospital risk for under-50s to why schools are shutThe response to this virus is going to change how we all live our lives for the next few months -but now the government has released some of the advice that led them to make their decisions,"                     Since the impact of coronavirus began to be felt in the UK a lot of controversy has surrounded the government's decisions.                   Have they moved quick enough Is the advice they've been taking being directed by people who aren't experts in public health or medicineBut after a careless statements about if the government planned to get people infected to build up ""herd immunity"" -they don't -people were concerned.Today the government has published a range of the scientific advice for people to read -so you can see the recommendations independent scientists are giving them.Most of it comes to the government through the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies SAGE, which provides ministers and officials with evidence-based scientific advice in emergencies.SAGE relies on external scientific advice, including advice from expert groups.Government Chief Scientific Adviser Sir Patrick Vallance defended the UK's response as he put the advice into the public domain.He said: ""This is an incredibly fast-moving, developing situation and as part of our collective efforts to give the clearest and most reliable scientific advice, SAGE has and continues to draw upon a huge range of experts and a huge range of evidence.""The UK is home to experts who are at the forefront of their chosen fields and we are making full use of their expertise to grow our understanding of COVID-19 as we work tirelessly to tackle this disease.""The collective evidence we have published today has played a considerable role in shaping our recommendations.""                     So here is what we learned from reading it.                   And if you're really curious you can read it yourself here                     Why schools are closed and why they might be closed for a while                                                               Coronavirus list of 'key workers' whose kids should stay in school finally published                                                                                    Coronavirus: 1.4m 'at risk' people to be told by NHS to stop all social contact                                        From today schools will be closed -except for the most vulnerable children and those whose parents are key workers. But the scientific advice suggests that they might end up being closed for longer than we expected.In advice given in early March scientists told the government that ""school closures are likely to impact transmission, although significantly less than with flu"".They warned that ""mass school closures are unlikely to reduce the final size of the epidemic and are unlikely to delay the peak by more than 3 weeks""But they also suggested that to get the most from closing schools that ""longer school closures are likely to be more effective then shorter ones and are less sensitive to timing relative to the epidemic peak"".So the disruption may go on longer than some are expecting in classrooms.                     Social isolation rules may need to be in place for at least a year                                                               Question Time: Tory Matt Hancock admits he couldn't live on £94 coronavirus sick pay                                        Strict rules on avoiding social contact may need to last ""at least most of a year"", the government's scientific advisors have revealed.The Scientific Pandemic Influenza Group on Modelling has published advice which shows the vast scale of coronavirus ""social distancing"" measures into the future.The advice was agreed between experts on Monday, three days before Boris Johnson claimed Britain could ""turn the tide"" on Covid-19 within 12 weeks.The scientists said current rules on avoiding unnecessary travel, social gatherings and pubs, bars and restaurants, could be lifted intermittently for a short while at a time.However, that would then allow the virus to surge again so restrictions would need to be put back in place.If this happened, the entire period of on-off restrictions would need to be spread over ""at least most of a year"" -with at least six of the 12 months having the restrictions ""on"".The advice is not binding on the government, or official advice to the public. It is instead a summary of what the government's advisors believe at that moment in time.                     This epidemic could take 3-5 months to hit its peak                   Boris Johnson has said that the peak could be behind us in the next 12 weeks -and while the scientists are slightly less optimistic, they don't disagree.One paper says that while the duration will ""be longer than for a typical influenza pandemic"" that the peak should hit around ""3 - 5 months after the establishment of widespread sustained transmission"".Or around 12 to 20 weeks from now.There will be some variation across the UK -with London understood to be ahead of the rest of the country -and this could be as much as ""around 4 - 6 weeks"".                     Eight percent of people infected could end up in hospital                                                               Coronavirus: Police handed sweeping powers to keep people in quarantine for a month                                        Part of the social distancing strategy is to try and delay cases to avoid overwhelming the NHS. In early March scientists said that as many as one in 50 under-50s who get the virus could end up in hospital.For the over-80s this rises to 44%.The estimate is that 8% of those infected overall could end up in hospital.Once in hospital you are statistically much higher risk than in the rest of the population.""Current estimates are that mortality rates are 12% for hospitalised people, from 4% in the under-50s to 20% of over-80s, with 50% mortality in those hospitalised who require invasive ventilation,"" one report warns.But mortality rates on average might be slightly lower than they were first reported as being after the rise of the virus in China.According to government's scientific advice: ""Our best estimate of the infection fatality rate is in the range of 0.5% to 1%, ranging from 0.01% in the under 20s to 8% in the over 80s.Infected is from 2% in the under 50s to 44% of over 80s. This is equivalent to 8% of those infected overall.""Isolation will hit the poorest familes hardestIf you are showing symptoms you -and everyone in your houshold -is expected to self isolate for 14 days. But government advice says for some people it is going to difficult.Household isolation will ""have a disproportionate impact on poorer families"" -including through increased mental health problems that already hit people in poverty harder it warns.People may also become sick of the advice and take part in ""displacement"" activity like meeting in parks or holding a house party, they warned.                     What role are behavioural scientists playing in the advice                   A lot of controversy surrounded the government consulting behavioural scientists when shaping their strategy.In a paper from March 14 they aimed to set out what is and isn't part of the behavioural scientists' jobs when they are advising the Chief Science and Chief Medical Officers.It stressed that the behavioural scientists should ""not be asked to comment, and has not commented, on what interventions are effective or when they should be triggered"".""Instead, the group is asked to provide advice aimed at anticipating and helping people adhere to interventions that are recommended by medical or epidemiological experts.""                     Large scale rioting is unlikely and people will respond kindly                                                               Coronavirus plan: 15 key points from Boris Johnson's UK battle announcement                                        Behavioural scientists were asked to offer advice on how they think the virus may affect public order or crime.They agreed that ""large scale rioting is unlikely and rarely seen in these circumstances"" and that ""acts of altruism will likely predominate"".But they warned the government that it needed to be clear about the advice it was giving, and why it was giving it.They did warn that in some scenarios there may be an increase in ""opportunistic crime"".""If there are low numbers of police due to workplace absences, there could be a perception that the police have become disempowered.""This has the potential to exacerbate what might otherwise have been a minor issue, e.g. lead to a rise in opportunistic crime by those who are already antagonistic towards the police.""To avoid this, police actions should as far as possible be focused on dialogue and facilitation of legitimate public needs support rather than control.""                     Why the government is asking people to avoid bars and shops -and why they might close them                   While the advice says that the effect of closing large scale events -like football matches -might be minimal it is much clearer on why the government is asking us to avoid the pub.Smaller gatherings -in pubs, clubs or homes -are ""higher risk"".Scientists have said that ""smaller gatherings happen more frequently than larger ones so the cumulative effect is larger.""The risk of infection to an individual from attending public gatherings depends on the length of time they spend in close proximity to other people. The key factor isn't the size of the event, but the number of people you come into close contact with; duration of those contacts; and how close these contacts are.Family gatherings they warn are ""particularly high risk as they bring people into closer contact"" as are religious services with any physical contact involved.                     The language used is important                   The language used by the government matters.When telling the over-70s or those with pre-existing conditions to self-isolate, the government has used the term ""shielding themselves"".A note from behavioural scientists explains why.It says: ""An appropriate term is needed. Cocooning feels patronising. Isolation has negative overtones for older adults""                     After being infected it takes a while for symptoms to show                   As of early March scientists believed that the incubation period of coronavirus -ie the delay between an individual becoming infected and developing symptoms -is an average of 5 days, but can range between one and 11 days.This is approximately twice as long as for influenza.The maximum incubation period is used to define the period required for isolation, currently believed to be 14 days.",Newspaper; Web Publication
169,"A year of social distancing to beat coronavirus, scientists tell Johnson","March 20, 2020 Friday",International,thetimes.co.uk,1025,1025,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,"Chris Smyth, Whitehall Editor | Tom Whipple, Science Editor","A year of social distancing to beat coronavirus, scientists tell Johnson","Britain can expect to remain in some form of lockdown for a year, according to the scientific advice that led Boris Johnson to impose ""social distancing"" measures this week.Restrictions on socialising and travel might be eased off temporarily but will then be reimposed as NHS intensive care beds fill up again, according the government's chief coronavirus advisers.The minutes of the meeting of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) reveal that Mr Johnson was told on Monday that only by immediately emptying pubs and restaurants alongside shutting schools would Britain stand any chance of controlling the epidemic.Previously, experts had expressed unease at school closures, due to be imposed on Monday, suggesting that the policy would delay a peak by an absolute maximum of three weeks while hitting the poorest hardest.The PR advantages of looking tough were a key consideration in decisions to ban mass gatherings, with behavioural scientists reasoning that even if the move had little direct effect, people would be more likely to follow other advice if they saw the government taking drastic measures imposed in other countries.The experts say that ""large scale rioting is unlikely"" at the peak of an outbreak, unless people are worried that the government is failing to protect the public. ""Acts of altruism will predominate,"" the Sage advisers predict, but warn: ""A perception that the government response strategies are not effective in looking after the public may lead to an increase in tensions.""Official advice is based on a model of how the virus, the NHS and the British public would interact. Jeremy Farrar, director of the Wellcome Trust, who sits on Sage, told                    The Times                    that the timing of interventions had been a fine balancing act.""We on Sage will not get everything right, we will make mistakes,"" he said. ""There are no rules, there's no textbooks to follow here. These are judgement calls, made in very best faith but in tremendous difficulty.""Ministers were advised to ""promote collective action"" to prevent tensions and told: ""All messaging should reinforce a sense of community, that 'we are all in this together'.""Tensions were likely to rise when people viewed measures as being harder on some groups , according to the documents.""For those on low incomes, loss of income means inability to pay for food, heating, lighting, internet. This can be addressed by guaranteeing supplies during quarantine periods.""The government was concerned that banning large gatherings such as football matches and pop concerts while allowing smaller ones more popular with the middle classes, such as tennis and theatre, might lead to a sense of unfairness.The plan assumes half the nation follows advice but warns that ""this may be unachievable in the UK population"".""House parties, congregation of children in parks, and queues at takeaways"" are predicted to be side effects of social distancing measures, with ways to prevent tension considered.There were concerns that doctors and MPs might be offended if a blanket definition of those over 65 as being elderly and at risk was used. A strategy of ""shielding"" vulnerable people was named after the previous label of ""cocooning"" was deemed patronising, while isolation was seen as too negative.Transparency is seen as vital to avoid unrest and encourage compliance, with behavioural scientists telling ministers: ""Government should prioritise messaging that explains clearly why certain actions are being taken, ahead of messaging designed solely for reassuring the public.""The key Sage conclusions are summarised in a ""Consensus view on behavioural and social interventions"", dated Monday and presented to Mr Johnson at a Cobra meeting at which he decided to lock Britain down.It told him the current plan was failing and even with the addition of social distancing measures it was ""unclear"" whether the outbreak could be controlled. However, closing schools could avoid a disaster and ""should be followed as soon as practical"".The one-page summary stated: ""It was agreed that a policy of alternating between periods of more and less strict social distancing measures could plausibly be effective at keeping the number of critical care cases within capacity. These would need to be in place for at least most of a year.""Under such as policy, at least half of the year would be spent under the stricter social distancing measures.""Triggers for tightening and relaxing on social distances could be set regionally based on local intensive care capacity, but ""there would be a 2-3 week delay between measures being put into place and their impact being felt in ICU,"" the scientists said.The scientists estimated the impacts of different policies on the epidemic, both in isolation and when used together. School closures on their own, they believed, would reduce total cases and deaths by less than 5 per cent, while household quarantine would cut them by 10 per cent. Stopping large events and sporting fixtures would, on its own, have almost no effect. The greatest impact came from social distancing for the over-65s, which would cut 5 per cent of cases but up to a third of deaths.Social distancing for everyone would, the scientists believed, have the biggest effect on the ""peak"", cutting the maximum demand for NHS services by 50 to 60 per cent.Independent experts praised the government for releasing the papers, saying openness would help the public trust the advice they were being urged to follow. However, others questioned the reliance on mathematical models.Professor Jonathan Ball of the University of Nottingham said that with so much about coronavirus uncertain, models were ""little more than a complex mathematical guess"" when key facts such as how many people get the disease without symptoms remain unknown.""The only way to get a handle on these fundamental issues is to do the hard science - to actively pursue the virus in the community and work out how it behaves. One could argue that urgency around fact-gathering was replaced by misplaced hope that number-crunching would provide the absolute answer,"" he said.",Newspaper; Web Publication

He was co-chief of staff to Theresa May in the first 11 months of her premiership and cameras would catch him walking up Downing Street looking hairy and faintly Chekhovian. Then May blew the 2017 election and Timothy and his colleague Fiona Hill were fired, May telling them coldly: ""The donors think you need to go."" Given the calumnies pelted at Timothy at that time, it would have been understandable had he ditched politics and gone to run a massage bar on some beach in Goa. Instead he has written a book.Apart from a pacey introductory chapter, it is not a memoir - although such a volume could, as Timothy has told friends, have been called ""The Downing Street Year"".                    Remaking One Nation                    is, rather, a work of dense, dialectical contemplation about the future of conservatism. There is something almost penitential in its seriousness. Even those who slandered Timothy as a spin doctor will have to concede that he has inwardly digested an awful lot of political science before putting finger to keyboard. But does such cogitation make much impact on electoral prospects?Timothy's broad argument is that 21st-century conservatives (small c, for this is not a party-focused book) should embrace blue-collar Britain. They should abandon certain fetishes of Thatcherism and see that reining in the rich and powerful will win over poorer voters. Boosting working-class solidarity could be an antidote to political populism. Conservatives should resist the two extremes of ""ultra-liberalism"" - ie the fundamentalist economic liberalism of globalisers such as George Osborne, and the militant identity politics and                    Guardian                   -style liberalism of the nation-hating left. Timothy prefers ""essential liberalism"", which recognises both ""the inevitability of difference"" and the necessity for unity in a society. ""When liberalism becomes ideological,"" he writes, ""it undermines and attacks institutions, customs and traditions.""If all this sounds like David Cameron's Big Society, Timothy might not mind. And yet he goes a lot farther than that ""well-intentioned"" project and offers practical policy ideas. His enthusiasm for immigration controls and criticism of multiculturalism (which splinters the country) would give Cameroons an attack of the vapours.Timothy strays across recent party boundaries. He seeks greater employment rights for workers in the gig economy, suggests restricting hostile takeovers in the business world and thinks conservatives should break up the house-building sector. This would allow smaller construction firms to prevent profiteering by the big players (several of whom, though he does not say this, have been long-term Tory donors). Equally, Timothy yawns at the bien pensant obsession with getting more women into company boardrooms, an ""exclusively elite equality debate that alienates working-class men and women alike"". Likewise, talking about black women merely in terms of their colour is limiting. Yes, they are black but they might also be mothers, aunts, engineers, soldiers, conservatives, socialists, believers in God or hundreds of other things. ""Most members of identity groups want to be respected as individuals in their own right,"" Timothy writes.So terrorised have we become by the minority-rights industry, it is oddly liberating to read such arguments. And yet this book is not one to make you yelp. Its 260 tightly argued, dutifully footnoted pages have a philosophical tone that gave me brain-ache. I lost count of the uses of ""teleological"" - even after looking it up, I was confused. He uses phrases such as ""moral monists"", has graphs showing percentiles of global income distribution and solemnly mentions Hayek and Hobbes and JS Mill and ""Benthamite modelling"". Do keep up at the back. He refers, as though they are household names, to ""the Nobel prizewinner Daniel Kahneman"" and ""the moral psychoanalyst Jonathan Haidt"" and ""Judith Butler, the American gender theorist"". The indefinite article (ie ""a gender theorist"") might be better. Such stuff, along with his use of kilometres, initially niggled, but then I realised I was quite glad he was writing this stuff. One reason academia has become so constipated by the left is that we righties can seldom be fagged to take them on at their own pencil-sucking, sage-citing stodginess. Yet here is Timothy taking on the Foucaults at their own game. Attaboy.For all the intellectualism, two anecdotes leap off the pages. The first is of an Oxford high-table dinner attended by Gus O'Donnell, then cabinet secretary, and Mark Thompson, then director-general of the BBC. Both men enthused about open-door immigration, arguing that they felt a greater duty to the global population than to national welfare. The second is about Angela Rayner, a onetime teenage mum who is now Labour's would-be deputy leader. A Tory MP praised Rayner on her inspirational rise, saying: ""You should be one of us, Ange, this is why we're Conservatives. You've climbed out."" Rayner was horrified and Timothy sees why. ""Nobody, however successful they are, has succeeded alone. We all have a debt to others.""Most of this book must have been written before the 2019 election, when conservatism indeed looked in crisis. Although Timothy is fated for ever to be linked with May, his arguments have been either pinched or pre-empted by Boris Johnson. May's and Johnson's messages - ""a Britain for everyone"" and ""levelling-up"" - were almost identical, but it was Boris's brio that made the difference. Political ideas are important, but so is bombast.

A nation of shopfighters, presided over at a time of mortal peril by a newspaper columnist, who has for three decades moonlighted as his generation's leading liar. Still, as the words clawed into the side of the plague pit probably once read, ""We are where we are.""But where, currently, is that? It is a place where, at 5pm every day, the disease-threatened populace is expected to take prophylactic advice from Boris Johnson. From Monday, most British parents will be home-schooling their children. Not Johnson, of course - I imagine he doesn't want to break his own pledge on class sizes. The prime minister keeps saying that the forthcoming test to determine whether you have coronavirus will be "" as simple as a pregnancy test "", spaffing his sole area of expertise rather early in what is likely to be a long campaign.Actually, that's unfair. His other area of expertise is disguising rather basic points with needlessly obscure language. Once this made him a highly overrated prose stylist; now it could make him accomplice to the death of your relatives and friends. ""The key message,"" Johnson key-messaged on Tuesday, is that people follow the advice ""sedulously"". Ah, sedulously. Sedulously. The signal for 10 million hardworking families to draw down the leather-bound thesaurus from their shelves and browse synonyms for the word ""twat"".It has been quite something to watch Johnson's smirk kick back in, live on air, even while people are asking him about the soon-to-break ventilator crisisThe government's crisis communications strategy could not be going worse if it was being led by the last speaker of a dead language, with Typhoid Mary on bass. People are still clearly extremely confused by what the advice is. Never have bullet points been more called for, and you'd think someone as obsessed with the second world war as Johnson is would know that an effective Ministry of Information was inextricably linked to the success of the war effort. Unfortunately, as indicated, Johnson is basically just a columnist. I don't want to spaff what we might euphemise as my own area of expertise too early, but trust me on this: he is hardwired to spin that shit out for 1150 words. How to put this in terms that even a wildly overeducated prime minister can understand? JUST TELL US THE INFORMATION. It's a public safety briefing, not a fricking ring quest.The government's inability to clearly define essential terms means we are in a situation where ""self-isolating"" demonstrably means a range of things to different people. Same with ""social distancing"". These urgently need simple and precise definition, and a comms blitz everywhere from social media to news bulletins to short TV ads.Instead, Johnson prefers to chuck new soundbites on the pile. The current one is the pledge that ""we can turn the tide within the next 12 weeks"". If you missed this clip, don't worry. My suspicion is that you'll be seeing it hundreds of times more this year. It has a strong "" Over by Christmas "" vibe to it, and is the sort of thing you could imagine on the side of a bus.There is something deeply unsettling to watching Johnson and Dominic Cummings' Brexit media strategy be lightly repurposed for a deadly contagion. The prime minister is already crossing the streams, declaring repeatedly on Thursday: ""I'm very confident we'll get this thing done."" Mate ... that's your slogan for the other one? We're about three days off him telling us we can take back control.Yet control is once again looking somewhat tenuous. Huge amounts of this week have been dedicated to gaslighting the nation that, last week, no one in a position of power said ""herd immunity"" out loud. And yet, they did. Meanwhile, Dominic Cummings, high priest of the 20,000-word blog, can tell you everything about what the Manhattan Project taught us, but he seemingly can't work out that if you let a ""London will be imminently locked down"" story go viral for 18 hours before you deny it, then people WILL physically fight over bogroll. Nurses coming off 48-hour shifts WILL cry in videos because they can't buy anything in the shops. I guess Cummings is interested in behavioural science in the way I'm interested in Olympic figure skating. Which is to say, I like it, but I'm unbelievably, lethally shit at it.Physically, meanwhile, Johnson is ageing slightly quicker than the guy in Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade who drinks from the wrong grail and goes from middle-aged to ancient to exploding skeleton in around six seconds. There seems to be some unholy symbiosis between him and Rishi Sunak, who appears to be growing younger with every appearance. Perhaps for every year that the prime minister gains, the chancellor loses one. In a fortnight, Sunak will require home-schooling, while Johnson will be over 70 and consequently allowed to self-shield from having to do his job.Of course, we are not the only nation to be conducting an interesting social experiment to determine what happens if you elect a clinical narcissist to run a country which later turns out to be facing grave danger. At this stage, the US's experiment appears to be going rather worse, and you certainly wouldn't rule out Donald Trump judging November's elections to be something that had better be suspended under the circumstances.Even so, it has been quite something to watch Johnson's boredom and terminal ironist's smirk kick back in, live on air, as the week has progressed, even while people are asking him about the soon-to-break ventilator crisis in intensive care. ""Operation Last Gasp"" as Johnson reportedly called the need to address the equipment deficit in a conference call to manufacturers this week.What can you say? If there were any kind of movie justice, the key component for the coronavirus vaccine would occur naturally only in Johnson's brain stem. Alas, even in that eventuality, he'd decline to do the right thing for the greater good. Johnson has never at a single point suggested he got into this game for public service. His idea of heroic sacrifice is allowing someone else to raise his offspring.That the music should stop when Boris Johnson of all people is prime minister is the darkest of cosmic ironies. We are being asked to put our trust - our lives - in the hands of a man whose entire career, journalistic and political, has been built on a series of lies. It is the work of seconds to dredge up Johnson columns about radical population control, or Johnson buses about the NHS enjoying vast savings from the EU. Who knows which of these, if any, he ever really believed.Time and again this week I have been reminded of that great line from last year's Chernobyl drama series. ""When the truth offends, we lie and lie until we can no longer remember it is even there. But it is still there. Every lie we tell incurs a debt to the truth. Sooner or later, that debt is paid.""

176,Dire scientific models suggest social restrictions may last until next year;Coronavirus ; The advice on which the Government based its plans for combating the virus also cast doubts on the validity of some current strategies Expert guidance,"March 21, 2020 Saturday",International,The Daily Telegraph (London),1630,1630,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,Sarah Knapton ;Henry Bodkin,Dire scientific models suggest social restrictions may last until next yearCoronavirus ; The advice on which the Government based its plans for combating the virus also cast doubts on the validity of some current strategies Expert guidance,"The scientific advice on which the Government has based its coronavirus strategy was released yesterday, giving a grim insight into the expected progression of the virus and calling into question some of the strategies.Documents studied by the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) showed that social measures to keep people apart may need to be in place for most of the year to control the spread.Millions may already be infected according to worst-case modelling.The Government published the papers a day after Boris Johnson said he expected the tide to be turned in the fight against Covid-19 within 12 weeks.Modelling shows the crisis could last far longer, with the virus potentially returning next winter.Many of the measures enacted may also have unintended consequences. Here is what we now know: Infected Britons The number of Britons who have already been infected could be hundreds of thousands.Calculations by the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM) found a huge range of possibilities for the number of people with the disease, from around 6,000 to 23 million.Health experts are increasingly concerned that hundreds of thousands of people may be infected with a mild form of the disease without even knowing it, and could be inadvertently spreading the virus while they think they are healthy.The Department of Health is keen to roll out an antibody test which could tell if someone has already been infected and has built up immunity, meaning they would no longer need to adopt social isolation or distancing measures. The team at LSHTM ran 25,000 epidemic simulations for different death and infection rate scenarios ranging from 1.5 to 10 per cent death rate in the population and someone infecting between one and three people.For a scenario with a death rate of 1 per cent, in which each infected person infects three more - closest to what is currently thought to be happening - they found one death points to a minimum of 37 cases, a maximum of 138,624 and a median of 1,733. With the current number of deaths at 167, it means that between 6,179 and 23 million people could already be infected, giving a midpoint of nearly 290,000.Contact tracing Scientists at the universities of Oxford, Warwick and Lancaster found contact tracing could reduce the transmission rate from 3.11 people to 0.21 - enabling the outbreak to be contained. They carried out a postal and online survey, asking 5,802 people how many social interactions they had on a given day and found that the average number of contacts over a 14-day period was 217.Of these total encounters, an average of 59 contacts (27 per cent) met the definition of a close contact (within 6ft for 15 minutes) and 36 (61 per cent) could be traced.However the team said that even with contact tracing, they would still expect 15 per cent of all infected people to generate at least one case that could not be identified. Separate modelling by the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine found if an infected person infected another 1.5, then tracing fewer than 50 per cent of contacts was enough to control the outbreak.However once it reached an infection rate of 2.5 people, health officials would need to trace 70 per cent, and by 3.5 they would need to contact nine out of 10 people that the infected person had met.They also found that tracing and isolation was only feasible when less than 1 per cent of transmission occurred before symptom onset. Currently there is no data on how many people are becoming infected before symptom onset.The team concluded ""highly effective contact tracing"" and case isolation is enough to control a new outbreak of Covid-19 within three months. However the Department of Health no longer traces contacts.Peak Modelling from the Universities of Exeter, Bristol and Warwick show that without any measures, the epidemic would have peaked around 133 days after first person-to-person transmission in Britain, which occurred around Feb 29.So without intervention coronavirus would have peaked in late June to early July.They also found that an outbreak starting in Brighton, or the South East peaks in London and the South East first, with North East England, Yorkshire and Humber and Wales following with a 10-day lag.Symptoms Imperial College London found people suffering from coronavirus may experience a wide range of symptoms, not simply fever and a cough.Other symptoms included fatigue, fever, chill, headache, diarrhoea and nasal congestion. A few cases also suffered confusion, dizziness, nausea, difficulty walking and vomiting.The team looked at 107,000 cases from mainland China, Hong Kong, Japan, Singapore and South Korea.They found that among people hospitalised, from the onset of symptoms, they developed pneumonia within five days, and needed ventilation within eight days.School closures The closure of schools and other public places risks inadvertently spreading coronavirus, SAGE behavioural scientists warned the Government.Extra house parties and meetings in parks are among the scenarios predicted as a result of a lockdown. Longer queues in takeaway shops are also the subject of a warning.In a document dated March 4, the Scientific Pandemic Influenza Group on Behaviours says: ""Empirical evidence for the behavioural and social impact of, and adherence to, each of the strategies is limited. We are not aware of any evidence on their interaction.""They go on: ""If all policies are applied, then the closure of schools, the loss of usual outlets for social interactions, and the absence of grandparents and entire families as a result of isolation might lead to unexpected displacement of activity.""For example, house parties, congregation of children in parks, and queues at takeaways. Consideration will be needed as to how to manage these situations without causing confrontation. "" The SPI-B went on to suggest that shutting schools would be an unpopular intervention.

177,Dire scientific models suggest social restrictions may last until next year;The advice on which the Government based its plans for combating the virus also cast doubts on the validity of some current strategies Expert guidance,"March 21, 2020 Saturday",International,The Daily Telegraph (London),1630,1630,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,Sarah Knapton,Dire scientific models suggest social restrictions may last until next yearThe advice on which the Government based its plans for combating the virus also cast doubts on the validity of some current strategies Expert guidance,"The scientific advice on which the Government has based its coronavirus strategy was released yesterday, giving a grim insight into the expected progression of the virus and calling into question some of the strategies.Documents studied by the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) showed that social measures to keep people apart may need to be in place for most of the year to control the spread.Millions may already be infected according to worst-case modelling.The Government published the papers a day after Boris Johnson said he expected the tide to be turned in the fight against Covid-19 within 12 weeks.Modelling shows the crisis could last far longer, with the virus potentially returning next winter.Many of the measures enacted may also have unintended consequences. Here is what we now know: Infected Britons The number of Britons who have already been infected could be hundreds of thousands.Calculations by the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM) found a huge range of possibilities for the number of people with the disease, from around 6,000 to 23 million.Health experts are increasingly concerned that hundreds of thousands of people may be infected with a mild form of the disease without even knowing it, and could be inadvertently spreading the virus while they think they are healthy.The Department of Health is keen to roll out an antibody test which could tell if someone has already been infected and has built up immunity, meaning they would no longer need to adopt social isolation or distancing measures. The team at LSHTM ran 25,000 epidemic simulations for different death and infection rate scenarios ranging from 1.5 to 10 per cent death rate in the population and someone infecting between one and three people.For a scenario with a death rate of 1 per cent, in which each infected person infects three more - closest to what is currently thought to be happening - they found one death points to a minimum of 37 cases, a maximum of 138,624 and a median of 1,733. With the current number of deaths at 167, it means that between 6,179 and 23 million people could already be infected, giving a midpoint of nearly 290,000.Contact tracing Scientists at the universities of Oxford, Warwick and Lancaster found contact tracing could reduce the transmission rate from 3.11 people to 0.21 - enabling the outbreak to be contained. They carried out a postal and online survey, asking 5,802 people how many social interactions they had on a given day and found that the average number of contacts over a 14-day period was 217.Of these total encounters, an average of 59 contacts (27 per cent) met the definition of a close contact (within 6ft for 15 minutes) and 36 (61 per cent) could be traced.However the team said that even with contact tracing, they would still expect 15 per cent of all infected people to generate at least one case that could not be identified. Separate modelling by the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine found if an infected person infected another 1.5, then tracing fewer than 50 per cent of contacts was enough to control the outbreak.However once it reached an infection rate of 2.5 people, health officials would need to trace 70 per cent, and by 3.5 they would need to contact nine out of 10 people that the infected person had met.They also found that tracing and isolation was only feasible when less than 1 per cent of transmission occurred before symptom onset. Currently there is no data on how many people are becoming infected before symptom onset.The team concluded ""highly effective contact tracing"" and case isolation is enough to control a new outbreak of Covid-19 within three months. However the Department of Health no longer traces contacts.Peak Modelling from the Universities of Exeter, Bristol and Warwick show that without any measures, the epidemic would have peaked around 133 days after first person-to-person transmission in Britain, which occurred around Feb 29.So without intervention coronavirus would have peaked in late June to early July.They also found that an outbreak starting in Brighton, or the South East peaks in London and the South East first, with North East England, Yorkshire and Humber and Wales following with a 10-day lag.Symptoms Imperial College London found people suffering from coronavirus may experience a wide range of symptoms, not simply fever and a cough.Other symptoms included fatigue, fever, chill, headache, diarrhoea and nasal congestion. A few cases also suffered confusion, dizziness, nausea, difficulty walking and vomiting.The team looked at 107,000 cases from mainland China, Hong Kong, Japan, Singapore and South Korea.They found that among people hospitalised, from the onset of symptoms, they developed pneumonia within five days, and needed ventilation within eight days.School closures The closure of schools and other public places risks inadvertently spreading coronavirus, SAGE behavioural scientists warned the Government.Extra house parties and meetings in parks are among the scenarios predicted as a result of a lockdown. Longer queues in takeaway shops are also the subject of a warning.In a document dated March 4, the Scientific Pandemic Influenza Group on Behaviours says: ""Empirical evidence for the behavioural and social impact of, and adherence to, each of the strategies is limited. We are not aware of any evidence on their interaction.""They go on: ""If all policies are applied, then the closure of schools, the loss of usual outlets for social interactions, and the absence of grandparents and entire families as a result of isolation might lead to unexpected displacement of activity.""For example, house parties, congregation of children in parks, and queues at takeaways. Consideration will be needed as to how to manage these situations without causing confrontation. "" The SPI-B went on to suggest that shutting schools would be an unpopular intervention. This advice was issued to the Government before announcements this week that most schools would be closed from Monday.""SPI-B have a consensus view that school closures will be highly disruptive and likely to present an unequal burden to different sections of society,"" the document says.""Our understanding of reports from Japan is that there is growing discontent around the policy.""Alternating regions Social distancing could be alternated on a regional basis to give people a break from draconian restrictions.The Scientific Pandemic Influenza Group on Modelling, which feeds into SAGE, proposed that because of the length of the outbreak, parts of the country could enjoy greater freedoms for six months at a time, before returning to lockdown.In a document dated March 16, the day the Prime Minister announced the beginning of the UK's ""delay"" phase, the group wrote: ""It was agreed that a policy of alternating between periods of more and less strict social distancing measures could plausibly be effective at keeping the number of critical care cases within capacity.""These would need to be in place for at least most of a year.

178,"How to unite Britain: first, ditch 'ultra-liberalism';Nick Timothy, the former chief of staff to Theresa May, has good ideas about wooing blue-collar Britain, says Quentin Letts","March 21, 2020 Saturday",International,The Times (London),964,964,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,Quentin Letts,"How to unite Britain: first, ditch 'ultra-liberalism'Nick Timothy, the former chief of staff to Theresa May, has good ideas about wooing blue-collar Britain, says Quentin Letts","Remaking One NationConservatism in an Age of Crisisby Nick TimothyPolity, 224pp; £20Four years ago, back when he had a trawlerman's beard, Nick Timothy was the most powerful man in the land. He was co-chief of staff to Theresa May in the first 11 months of her premiership and cameras would catch him walking up Downing Street looking hairy and faintly Chekhovian. Then May blew the 2017 election and Timothy and his colleague Fiona Hill were fired, May telling them coldly: ""The donors think you need to go."" Given the calumnies pelted at Timothy at that time, it would have been understandable had he ditched politics and gone to run a massage bar on some beach in Goa. Instead he has written a book.Apart from a pacey introductory chapter, it is not a memoir - although such a volume could, as Timothy has told friends, have been called ""The Downing Street Year"". Remaking One Nation is, rather, a work of dense, dialectical contemplation about the future of conservatism. There is something almost penitential in its seriousness. Even those who slandered Timothy as a spin doctor will have to concede that he has inwardly digested an awful lot of political science before putting finger to keyboard. But does such cogitation make much impact on electoral prospects?Timothy's broad argument is that 21st-century conservatives (small c, for this is not a partyfocused book) should embrace blue-collar Britain. They should abandon certain fetishes of Thatcherism and see that reining in the rich and powerful will win over poorer voters. Boosting working-class solidarity could be an antidote to political populism.Conservatives should resist the two extremes of ""ultra-liberalism"" - ie the fundamentalist economic liberalism of globalisers such as George Osborne, and the militant identity politics and Guardian-style liberalism of the nation-hating left. Timothy prefers ""essential liberalism"", which recognises both ""the inevitability of difference"" and the necessity for unity in a society. ""When liberalism becomes ideological,"" he writes, ""it undermines and attacks institutions, customs and traditions.""If all this sounds like David Cameron's Big Society, Timothy might not mind. And yet he goes a lot farther than that ""well-intentioned"" project and offers practical policy ideas. His enthusiasm for immigration controls and criticism of multiculturalism (which splinters the country) would give Cameroons an attack of the vapours.Timothy strays across party boundaries. He seeks greater employment rights for workers in the gig economy, suggests restricting hostile takeovers in the business world and thinks conservatives should break up the house-building sector. This would allow smaller construction firms to prevent profiteering by the big players (several of whom, though he does not say this, have been long-term Tory donors).Equally, Timothy yawns at the bien pensant obsession with getting more women into company boardrooms, an ""exclusively elite equality debate that alienates working-class men and women alike"". Likewise, talking about black women merely in terms of their colour is limiting. Yes, they are black, but they might also be mothers, aunts, engineers, soldiers, conservatives, socialists, believers in God or hundreds of other things. ""Most members of identity groups want to be respected as individuals in their own right,"" Timothy writes.So terrorised have we become by the minority-rights industry, it is oddly liberating to read such arguments. Yet this book is not one to make you yelp. Its 260 tightly argued, dutifully footnoted pages have a philosophical tone that gave me brain-ache. I lost count of the uses of ""teleological"" - even after looking it up, I was confused.He uses phrases such as ""moral monists"", has graphs showing percentiles of global income distribution and solemnly mentions Hayek and Hobbes and JS Mill and ""Benthamite modelling"". Do keep up at the back. He refers, as though they are household names, to ""the Nobel prizewinner Daniel Kahneman"" and ""the moral psychoanalyst Jonathan Haidt"" and ""Judith Butler, the American gender theorist"".The indefinite article (ie ""a gender theorist"") might be better. Such stuff, along with his use of kilometres, initially niggled, but then I realised I was quite glad he was writing this stuff. One reason academia has become so constipated by the left is that we righties can seldom be fagged to take them on at their own pencilsucking, sage-citing stodginess. Here is Timothy taking on the Foucaults at their own game.Attaboy. For all the intellectualism, two anecdotes leap off the pages. The first is of an Oxford high-table dinner attended by Gus O'Donnell, then cabinet secretary, and Mark Thompson, then director-general of the BBC. Both men enthused about opendoor immigration, arguing that they felt a greater duty to the global population than to national welfare.The second is about Angela Rayner, a onetime teenage mum who is now Labour's would-be deputy leader. A Tory MP praised Rayner on her inspirational rise, saying: ""You should be one of us, Ange, this is why we're Conservatives. You've climbed out."" Rayner was horrified and Timothy sees why. ""Nobody, however successful they are, has succeeded alone. We all have a debt to others.""Most of this book must have been written before the 2019 election, when conservatism indeed looked in crisis. Although Timothy is fated for ever to be linked with May, his arguments have been either pinched or pre-empted by Boris Johnson. May's and Johnson's messages - ""a Britain for everyone"" and ""levelling-up"" - were almost identical, but it was Boris's brio that made the difference. Political ideas are important, but so is bombast.Timothy's enthusiasm for controls on immigration would give Cameroons an attack of the vapours",Newspaper

The scientists were unanimous that ""school closures will be highly disruptive and likely to present an unequal burden to different sections of society"".It was clear to them that in shutting down schools, poorer students would suffer the most - especially those on free school meals - and parents would struggle to stay working. The committee also fretted about the possibility that grandparents would be drafted in for childcare and so exposed to yet more risk.They concluded that, despite the social costs, to give the country the best hope of suppressing the disease schools would have to close.PR OF BANNING MASS GATHERINGSWhile other countries shut down football matches and concerts, Britain's scientists concluded this would have ""very little"" effect on the outbreak. Indeed, stopping ""some public gatherings could mean people replace this with other activities, (ie playing football behind closed doors could mean fans watch the match in the pub, potentially slightly accelerating epidemic spread"".Finally, the public demand for something to be done was a key consideration. Behavioural scientists concluded that if a section of the public thought the government's actions were incompetent, there was a danger that they might ignore more effective measures.""Acting in a way that does not meet expectations poses a risk that a section of the public will view government actions as incompetent or not in the public's best interests,"" they said.DINNER WITH FRIENDS IS WORSEYesterday's shutdown of the leisure industry was based on the scientists' view that intimate gatherings were more dangerous than stadium events. ""Smaller gatherings such as bars and nightclubs are higher risk as you can be in closer contact with others. Family gatherings are particularly high risk as they bring people into closer contact. Similarly, religious services with a high level of physical contact would be higher risk,"" they wrote.PUBLIC DISORDER UNLIKELYBritain will, at least in the estimation of Sage, Keep Calm and Carry On. ""Large scale rioting is unlikely,"" the scientists concluded. ""Acts of altruism will predominate."" They advised that these could even be encouraged. ""All messaging should reinforce a sense of community, that 'we are all in this together'.""BUT ARE WE ALL IN IT TOGETHER?To bring all groups of society with them, Sage said it was crucial the pain was shared. ""Resistance and non-compliance will be greater if impacts of this policy are inequitable,"" the documents explain. This means supporting the poorest. ""For those on low incomes, loss of income means inability to pay for food, heating, lighting, internet. This can be addressed by guaranteeing supplies during quarantine periods.""INCUBATION PERIODOn average, it takes five days after a person is infected with coronavirus for them to show symptoms, twice as long as flu. This means control measures must be imposed for longer, explaining the policy of quarantining families of patients for 14 days.MIDDLE CLASS MUST SHARE PAINThe ""all in it together"" message was perceived to be at risk if the government was seen to be banning more popular activities. ""The definition of 'public gathering' leaves room for tension, as preventing larger mass gatherings (football matches, pop concerts) but leaving small mass gatherings permitted (tennis, theatre) may be perceived as unequal treatment,"" scientists warn.AT LEAST HALF WILL IGNORE ADVICEThe government was initially reluctant to impose drastic measures for fear that people would tire of them by the time they had an effect. There is also scepticism about whether an open country like Britain can cope with Chinesestyle controls. ""These interventions assume compliance levels of 50 per cent or more over long periods of time. This may be unachievable in the UK population and uptake of these measures is likely to vary across groups, possibly leading to variation in outbreak intensities across different communities,"" the scientists said.THE OLD ARE NOT ALL VULNERABLEMr Johnson has urged the over-70s to pay particular attention to social distancing measures , given evidence older people are more likely to die.However, the scientists urged ""sensitivity"" in setting out who counts as vulnerable. They said: ""A blanket application of ""over 65"" may be unambiguous, but will not be helpful if this includes healthy individuals such as recently retired doctors or MPs.""

Letters, page 32; Leading article, page 33Q&AHow is a test sample taken?The first steps involve taking a swab of a person's throat or nose to collect mucus and other material. This is sent to a laboratory.What happens in the lab?The sample is purified and genetic material is extracted. The virus's genetic code is then converted from a molecule known as RNA to DNA. A technique called the polymerase chain reaction then finds a strand of DNA from the virus and rapidly produces a large number of copies so that it can be detected.How does the test recognise the virus?Scientists create two new fragments of DNA known as primers. These bind to any strand of coronavirus DNA that they encounter and are specific to the virus code so will not bind to DNA from any other source.How long does it take?Once the sample reaches the lab it can take about four hours. However, a lack of laboratory capacity can create a bottleneck that means it can take several days to get results.What are the test's advantages?It gives very few ""false positive"" results. It also provides information on how much virus is in a person's system. This may give an indication of how ill a person is likely to get, which could be used to triage patients.Disadvantages?The test will not work properly if the virus's genetic code mutates. If this happens, a new version of the test is needed. It will not successfully identify people who have had the virus but have cleared it. To identify them you need a test that is sensitive to the antibodies that they gain after having the disease. You also need good samples to begin with.How many tests is Britain doing?The government's chief scientific adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance, said 4,000 tests were being carried out daily.Boris Johnson has announced plans to ramp it up to 25,000 tests a day. The previous week he had said that NHS England said it would be increasing its testing from 5,000 to 10,000 a day. The head of the World Health Organisation, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said that failing to test was like ""fighting a fire blindfolded"".",Newspaper

185,"Rioting and crime is unlikely during the coronavirus pandemic, say UK scientific advisers despite warning of flashpoints over stretched healthcare facilities or goods shortages","March 21, 2020 Saturday",International,MailOnline,827,827,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,Colin Fernandez Science Correspondent For The Daily Mail,"Rioting and crime is unlikely during the coronavirus pandemic, say UK scientific advisers despite warning of flashpoints over stretched healthcare facilities or goods shortages","•Experts said that rather than looting, 'acts of altruism will likely predominate'•But it warned disorder could still be triggered by the Government's response•Potential flashpoints could be pressure on healthcare facilities and shortagesLarge scale rioting and crime is 'unlikely' during the coronavirus pandemic - unless the Government is incompetent or large numbers of police fall sick, the government's scientific advisers warn.The insights come in newly released papers from the government scientific panel, called SPI-B, the Scientific Pandemic Influenza Group on Behaviour.The scientists said rather than looting and street fighting, 'acts of altruism will likely predominate and the Government could promote and guide these'. But the committee warned that public disorder can arise 'triggered by the Government's response... rather than the nature of the epidemic'.Flashpoints could be pressure on healthcare facilities and shortages over items such as face masks and hand sanitiser and perceptions that the government's response to contain the outbreak has been inadequate.The panel said, however, there was a risk of rioting and 'opportunistic crime' from staff absences in police forces.Low police numbers - caused by absences - could lead to 'a perception the police have become disempowered'.This 'could lead to a rise in opportunistic crime by those who are already antagonistic towards the police', the report warned.If police actions are experienced by the public as 'excessive' - when they are stopping the public access services such as food or healthcare which they feel they have a right to 'may lead to increased tensions.' The government should 'promote a sense of collectivism', the scientific advisors suggest.In echoes of the financial crisis of 2008, the scientists advise reinforcing a sense of community and 'that we are all in this together'. 'This will avoid increasing tensions between different groups, promote social norms and 'lead to self-policing'.The advisors also warned school closures could lead to a double spike in the epidemic, with disease numbers increasing once again when schools reopen, the scientific panel warned.This was based their suggestion on experience with a previous influenza outbreak in the UK.It said that in the 2009 swine flu pandemic, the school summer holiday, 'interrupted transmission to such an extent that the UK epidemic was split into two waves, with the second coming after their reopening'.The scientists said the models assumed children would have a similar role in passing on coronavirus as influenza.But they warned this outbreak might be different, if there was a 'smaller the role of children in transmission, the lower the impact of school closures.' They also said the impact of school closures on COVID-19 is likely to be smaller than in 2009 because the average time of onset after the infection is transmitted is longer than for the flu.The coronavirus - based on figures from the outbreak in Wuhan - also appears to be more infectious than swine flu.As a result, 'schools would have to be closed for longer to have the same effect.' It said that school closures were also less likely to be effective compared to the 2009 flu outbreak as some adults already had immunity 'so a higher proportion of transmission took place within schools.' The scientists said that the effects of school closures are 'very uncertain' as many factors about the virus are unknown, including the role of children in passing on the infection.One computer model suggested a reduction of the peak number of cases by 20-60 per cent when schools are closed between 6-12 weeks.An alternative computer model suggests a much lower reduction - between 7..5 per cent to 30 per cent.The effect in delaying the peak of the UK epidemic through mass school closures 'appears modest through a range of plausible parameters and approaches: no more than 3 weeks and possibly far less.The report adds: 'Any impact from school closures on the total number of cases is likely to be highly limited.' The report warns that school closures may 'extend the duration of a UK epidemic'.They also said that 'As infections appear to be more severe in older people, putting children in the care of their grandparents may result in a higher number of severe cases.'The scientists warn that small family gatherings may pose a bigger risk to pass on the virus than larger events. They warn: 'The risk to an individual from attending large events is generally no higher than in smaller events. In most larger events, such as sports matches, attendees will come into close contact with at most a handful of people, so the risk to attendees is low.'Smaller gatherings such as bars and nightclubs are higher risk as you can be in closer contact with others. Family gatherings are particularly high risk as they bring people into closer contact. Similarly, religious services with a high level of physical contact would be higher risk.'",Web Publication
186,"Coronavirus: ten days that shook Britain - and changed the nation for ever;How Boris Johnson changed his priorities: save lives first, and then salvage the economy","March 22, 2020 Sunday",International,thetimes.co.uk,3057,3057,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,Tim Shipman and Caroline Wheeler,"Coronavirus: ten days that shook Britain - and changed the nation for everHow Boris Johnson changed his priorities: save lives first, and then salvage the economy","There was a moment, when the decisions were made, when they wondered what on earth they had done, how far they had been forced to go. A moment when they sat ""shellshocked"", reflecting on choices that will change Britain for the rest of our lives. ""It took us the weekend to get ourselves into the emotional position where we were comfortable taking the decisions we took,"" a minister said. ""They were massive.""In politics, there is so much overstatement. Not this time. Ten days ago the government was slowly gearing up its response to the coronavirus crisis, downplaying the need for drastic measures. By Monday, Boris Johnson had ordered an expansion of the state not seen since the Second World War to save the National Health Service, an institution formed in the cauldron of that conflict. A wartime-style lockdown of the capital was under active consideration.This weekend, the events of the last week have already changed health policy, changed the economy and are already changing the people involved.The last time the British state began a multiple service attack on a lurking enemy - D-Day in 1944 - it became known as The Longest Day. On Thursday one cabinet minister reflected: ""It feels like the longest week. It felt like Brexit was going to change the country but it is the coronavirus that will do that now.""Senior figures in government are insistent that the changes they made to the virus clampdown were not ""a U-turn"" but a vehicle accelerating faster along a track already laid. In truth, they no more resemble what went before than the space shuttle did a Citroën 2CV.Conversations with more than a dozen ministers and cabinet ministers, special advisers, Downing Street staff and civil servants reveal a human drama, of leaders tested as never before and of the single most frightening warning a British prime minister has received in eight decades.                   A shock to the system                   The meeting that will change British society for a generation took place on the evening of Thursday, March 12. That was when the strategic advisory group of experts (Sage in Whitehall parlance), the government's committee of scientists and medics, gathered to examine modelling from experts at Imperial College London and other institutions.The results were shattering. A week earlier, councils had been warned to expect about 100,000 deaths from Covid-19. Now Chris Whitty, the chief medical officer, and Sir Patrick Vallance, the chief scientific adviser, realised the estimates were wrong.""Unmitigated, the death number was 510,000,"" a senior figure said. ""Mitigated we were told it was going to be 250,000. Once you see a figure of take no further action and a quarter of a million people die, the question you ask is, 'What action?'"" Another insider said: ""There was a collision between the science and reality.""Ministers had been on notice that drastic action might be needed since the virus first emerged in China's Wuhan province in December. In January, Whitty told the cabinet: ""It either stays in China or it will get everywhere."" For two months the government had time to prepare, but Johnson's instincts were to resist a life-changing crackdown. ""There was a lot of talk about how this was just a bit of flu,"" one senior Tory recalled.Dominic Cummings, the prime minister's senior aide, became convinced that Britain would be better able to resist a lethal second wave of the disease next winter if Whitty's prediction that 60% to 80% of the population became infected was right and the UK developed ""herd immunity"".At a private engagement at the end of February, Cummings outlined the government's strategy. Those present say it was ""herd immunity, protect the economy and if that means some pensioners die, too bad"".At the Sage meeting on March 12, a moment now dubbed the ""Domoscene conversion"", Cummings changed his mind. In this ""penny-drop moment"", he realised he had helped set a course for catastrophe. Until this point, the rise in British infections had been below the European average. Now they were above it and on course to emulate Italy, where the picture was bleak. A minister said: ""Seeing what was happening in Italy was the galvanising force across government.""By Friday, March 13, Cummings had become the most outspoken advocate of a tough crackdown. ""Dominic himself had a conversion,"" a senior Tory said. ""He's gone from 'herd immunity and let the old people die', to 'let's shut down the country and the economy.'""Cummings had a ""meeting of minds"" with Matt Hancock, the health secretary, who wanted stronger action to prevent NHS hospitals being swamped. Department of Health officials had impressed on Hancock that the death rate in Wuhan province was 3.4% when the hospitals were overrun and 0.7% elsewhere in China.Johnson had also been queasy about the previous original approach. ""Boris hated the language of 'herd immunity' because it implied that it was OK for people to die,"" a senior source said. ""Matt hated the language because it implied we had given up. You've got to fight.""                   Herd immunity                   The problem for the government was that at the moment herd immunity was being banished from policy, it had become the focus of publicity. That Wednesday, David Halpern of the Whitehall ""nudge unit"" put the phrase in the public domain. Two days later, Vallance repeated the idea on Radio 4. With Italy, France and Spain going into lockdown, the government's critics accused Johnson of refusing to act because he wanted people to get ill.Insiders say it was ""very bumpy"" that Friday. ""The meetings were very messy,"" said one source. But when Johnson gathered his key advisers in the cabinet room at 9.15am last Saturday there was unanimity. Whitty and Vallance explained that Britain had been four weeks behind Italy ""and now we are closer"".The two experts, together with Hancock and Cummings, all delivered to Johnson one message: ""Now is the moment to act."" The prime minister agreed: ""We must work around the clock and take all necessary measures."" One of those present said: ""The mood in the room was astonishing. You could tell that something very significant had shifted.""Flesh was added to the bones in another crunch meeting in Downing Street on Sunday night and again in the 9.15am meetings and bilaterals between Johnson and key cabinet ministers throughout last week.The media was briefed that elderly and vulnerable people might have to self-isolate for a period of months and that everyone else would have to engage in ""social distancing"" - working from home, avoiding groups and unnecessary outings. Most significantly, without a gargantuan package of support for businesses, renters and the self-employed, millions of jobs would be lost and the economy would collapse.                   The economic response                   On Tuesday morning, as he prepared to unveil details of Britain's biggest peacetime financial package, Rishi Sunak, the chancellor, gathered his closest aides and officials in his book-lined study in 11 Downing Street. ""The scale of what is required is beyond anyone's current imagination,"" he said. ""We have to remove all limiting assumptions.""Over the weekend, Treasury officials worked through the night to prepare a package for business as if planning a full budget. ""They did three months' work in 48 hours,"" a Treasury source said. It helped that Charles Roxburgh, the second permanent secretary, and Andrew Bailey, the new governor of the Bank of England, were both veterans of the response to the 2008 financial crash.When he walked out with Johnson for a Downing Street news conference on Tuesday afternoon, aides were still finalising Sunak's comments as the statement came off the printer. The chancellor had no time to rehearse or to prepare for questions but gave an assured performance as he outlined plans for £350bn of government-backed loans and cash grants for business. ""We will do whatever it takes,"" he repeatedly intoned.Colleagues say Sunak's confidence came because he is deeply engaged ""in the weeds"" of the policy. ""Some ministers set the broad parameters for 15 minutes and the officials go away and do the work,"" said one source. ""He's more hands-on. He prefers a 30 to 40-minute meeting where he can properly kick the tyres and help solve the problems. He's across the detail.""Measures to help save jobs took longer, with a plan for the government to pay a high percentage of wages in cash-strapped firms finally being announced on Friday afternoon. Sunak agreed the package in a meeting with Johnson on Thursday night in which the pair shared a vegetarian takeaway pizza. The prime minister said: ""In 2008, the government looked after the bankers. Now we must make sure we look after the people first.""At 11.30pm the chancellor was sending messages to his permanent secretary thanking him for the ""superb"" work of some officials. A colleague said: ""He's got the brainpower. More importantly, he's got the character for this moment.""Sunak will need it because the risks are immense. One friend said: ""Rishi is very acutely aware that we are in danger of driving the economy off a cliff by shutting everything up. All this talk of bouncing straight back . . . we will have no airlines to bounce straight back with if we're not careful.""The prime minister's big decision on Wednesday was that schools would close on Friday, a decision arrived at with Gavin Williamson, the education secretary. They decided to act as many schools took matters into their own hands, to try to ensure childcare for key workers.It was another decision Johnson had resisted the week before, but cabinet ministers are clear that behind the scenes he has been far more decisive at crunch moments than his predecessor. ""He's been absolutely brilliant,"" said one. ""He makes decisions fast."" Another said: ""If Theresa May was still be in charge we would, by now, have just about signed off a request that people wash their hands."" Another cabinet source added: ""And if Philip Hammond was still chancellor he would have refused even to pay for that.""Nonetheless, even admirers admit that Johnson is not finding it easy to project the same decisiveness in his somewhat hesitant public appearances. ""He's a naturally cheerful person,"" one colleague said. ""He finds it difficult to deliver bad news."" Business leaders were surprised during a conference call on Monday, when he was trying to persuade them to build ventilators, to hear him describe the effort as ""Operation Last Gasp"".Whitty and Vallance began their own press conferences at the end of the week amid concern that some of Johnson's pronouncements - including a claim that they could ""turn the tide"" within 12 weeks - were not grounded in evidence. ""Some of the experts are appalled by some of his claims,"" a Whitehall source said. A Tory aide said: ""Boris looks haunted. It's like when George W Bush came in thinking he was going to be the education-reforming president and had to deal with the war on terror."" Another senior Tory said: ""Boris is shellshocked.""                   Lockdown                   Johnson, who is a civil libertarian at heart, spent the week resisting Cummings's demands for a full-blown lockdown of London - banning inhabitants from travelling outside the city.Discussions about a shutdown were first aired at Cobra on Friday, March 13. By Tuesday the news was leaking after a Cabinet Office official emailed other departments to ask how a curfew might work. A Whitehall insider said: ""It was quickly established that the Paris model - with people being issued paperwork and allowed out of the family home one at a time would not work.""A senior Tory said: ""Boris really doesn't want to shut stuff down. He is more worried than most about the economic impact but also the social impact of locking people up in their homes for months. Fundamentally there is a Boris-Dom cleavage. First Boris bottled herd immunity. Now he's bottling lockdown.""Nonetheless, Johnson managed to fuel speculation that there would be troops on the streets and a travel ban by telling Wednesday's press conference that the government ""will not hesitate"" to take further steps. ""We live in a land of liberty,"" he said. ""But we will rule nothing out.""On Thursday the PM's spokesman was forced to say there were ""no plans"" to close down London transport and ""zero prospect"" of restrictions on travel. On Friday less draconian restrictions, closing pubs, clubs and restaurants nationwide, were unveiled. ""Whoever was briefing details of the full lockdown is bordering on a national security threat,"" said one Tory with links at the top of Whitehall. ""They are promulgating misinformation and spreading alarm.""Another source said the loose talk could have seen wealthy ""superspreaders"" flee London to infect people elsewhere: ""If you're going to do a lockdown you don't tell people first or you find they are all on the roof getting the last helicopter out of Saigon.""Nonetheless, Whitehall officials are quietly drawing up lists of key workers who would be issued with a travel permit if a full crackdown follows. Officials have also been working on a ""lockdown list"" of products that must be manufactured by law. They may yet be necessary. A minister said: ""We won't know for two weeks if the current measures are enough.""                   Communication problems                   On Thursday, after criticism from ministers and MPs that No 10 had failed to provide clear messages to the public, Cummings and the communications director, Lee Cain, summoned the team who won the general election.Isaac Levido, the Tory campaign director, went to No 10, with former Vote Leave hands Paul Stephenson and Henry de Zoete on a video conference call. Together they devised a slogan ""Stay home. Save lives. Protect our NHS,"" which was rolled out on Friday.The No 10 morning meeting is now held on the Zoom video app to allow more home working. To try to raise morale, Johnson has also sent video messages thanking civil servants for their hard work. On Tuesday he returned from a morning run with his dog Dilyn to find his spokesman, James Slack, at the back of No 10 wishing his mother a happy birthday. Johnson took the phone and spoke to her for 10 minutes.However, many sources report that the Downing Street machine is fast running out of steam. ""Everyone is working to capacity and is absolutely exhausted,"" said one insider. ""It's utter chaos and there is no end in sight.""Businesses phoning up to offer help say Downing Street seems ""swamped"". One ventilator manufacturer claimed on Newsnight that the government had not put in any orders - though sources say 1,400 firms are offering to build them and by Friday morning eight companies who have never made a ventilator were turning them out.Some in Downing Street are turning to drink. An aide joked on Thursday that they had run out of hand sanitiser and were ""using the contents of a vodka miniature"" instead. Others are recruiting old friends. Gabriel Milland, a former head of press to Michael Gove, was drafted into No 10 last week. Tom Shinner, the civil servant who did the most to prepare Britain for a no-deal Brexit, who left the government last year, has also been rehired.                   Ministerial infighting                   The toll is telling on ministers and tensions between them have bubbled over. ""It's miserable and horrible and you just have to get on with it,"" a cabinet minister said.The ""core four"" in all the key meetings are the chairmen of four inter-ministerial committees: Dominic Raab, the foreign secretary, who chairs the international committee; Sunak, who chairs the economic committee; Hancock, who chairs the health committee; and Gove, who chairs the other public sector committee.Numerous sources say Gove has repeatedly sniped at Hancock. ""There have been tensions over where responsibilities begin and end,"" one observed. Some ministers are lobbying to see Gove take charge if Johnson is incapacitated with Covid-19 or if he takes paternity leave, though Sunak ranks higher in the cabinet rankings on the gov.uk website and the job is likely to be Raab's, since he is officially ""first secretary of state"".But a minister said: ""Considering the scale of the massive decisions we have been making it has been remarkably collegiate.""Ministers hope the dramatic events of the last week will reduce the likely death toll from Covid-19 to ""a bad seasonal flu"", which means tens, not hundreds, of thousands of deaths. The worst recent year was 2014-15 when 28,000 people died.But there are perils ahead. ""Boris and his team are absolutely terrified because it will not be the NHS by end of this,"" a Whitehall source said. ""It will be the corona health service and will just be there to pump oxygen into patients.""MPs speculate that there will be two big inquiries - an international one into the origins of the virus in China's live animal ""wet markets""; and a second into the government's preparations and policy decisions. ""If we end up like Italy in two weeks' time and 30-year-old doctors are dropping dead, the government is going to be in big trouble,"" a Labour MP said.                   Shaking the world                   Amid the frenzy of events, more thoughtful Tories have concluded that the decisions taken last week will change three key aspects of the way the world works. One said: ""One is the debate around globalisation. Is Trump right that we just need to build bigger walls, or is Gordon Brown right that global problems need global solutions? The second is Socialism v The Free Market. Large parts of the economy are going to be socialised after this. I fear it leads to nationalists and socialists winning, to national socialism.""The third fissure may yet be the worst. ""It's the intergenerational question. It is unsustainable to have people in their youth put their whole life on hold for months while the economy tanks to save a 91-year-old who would have died six months later anyway.""Whatever the outcome, ministers have little doubt about the significance of the virus. ""It's shaking the world,"" one said. Another, who has been up to his neck in the dramas of the past three years, was more prosaic: ""My obituary gets more interesting every week.""The sadness is that there will be many other obituaries to be written too.",Web Publication

A moment when they sat ""shellshocked"", reflecting on choices that will change the UK for the rest of our lives. ""It took us the weekend to get ourselves into the emotional position where we were comfortable taking the decisions we took,"" a minister said. ""They were massive.""In politics, there is so much overstatement. Not this time. Ten days ago the British government was slowly gearing up its response to the coronavirus crisis, downplaying the need for drastic measures. By Monday, Boris Johnson had ordered an expansion of the state not seen since the Second World War to save the National Health Service, an institution formed in the cauldron of that conflict. A wartime-style lockdown of the capital was under active consideration.This weekend, the events of the last week have already changed health policy, changed the economy and are already changing the people involved.The last time the British state began a multiple service attack on a lurking enemy - D-Day in 1944 - it became known as The Longest Day. On Thursday one cabinet minister reflected: ""It feels like the longest week. It felt like Brexit was going to change the country but it is the coronavirus that will do that now.""Senior figures in government are insistent that the changes they made to the virus clampdown were not ""a U-turn"" but a vehicle accelerating faster along a track already laid. In truth, they no more resemble what went before than the space shuttle did a Citroën 2CV.Conversations with more than a dozen ministers and cabinet ministers, special advisers, Downing Street staff and civil servants reveal a human drama, of leaders tested as never before and of the single most frightening warning a British prime minister has received in eight decades.A SHOCK TO THE SYSTEMThe meeting that will change British society for a generation took place on the evening of Thursday, March 12. That was when the strategic advisory group of experts (Sage in Whitehall parlance), the government's committee of scientists and medics, gathered to examine modelling from experts at Imperial College London and other institutions.The results were shattering. A week earlier, councils had been warned to expect about 100,000 deaths from Covid-19. Now Chris Whitty, the chief medical officer, and Sir Patrick Vallance, the chief scientific adviser, realised the estimates were wrong.""Unmitigated, the death number was 510,000,"" a senior figure said. ""Mitigated we were told it was going to be 250,000. Once you see a figure of take no further action and a quarter of a million people die, the question you ask is, 'What action?'"" Another insider said: ""There was a collision between the science and reality.""Ministers had been on notice that drastic action might be needed since the virus first emerged in China's Wuhan province in December. In January, Whitty told the cabinet: ""It either stays in China or it will get everywhere."" For two months the government had time to prepare, but Johnson's instincts were to resist a lifechanging crackdown. ""There was a lot of talk about how this was just a bit of flu,"" one senior Tory recalled.Dominic Cummings, the prime minister's senior aide, became convinced that Britain would be better able to resist a lethal second wave of the disease next winter if Whitty's prediction that 60% to 80% of the population became infected was right and the UK developed ""herd immunity"".At a private engagement at the end of February, Cummings outlined the government's strategy. Those present say it was ""herd immunity, protect the economy and if that means some pensioners die, too bad"".At the Sage meeting on March 12, a moment now dubbed the ""Domoscene conversion"", Cummings changed his mind. In this ""penny-drop moment"", he realised he had helped set a course for catastrophe. Until this point, the rise in British infections had been below the European average. Now they were above it and on course to emulate Italy, where the picture was bleak. A minister said: ""Seeing what was happening in Italy was the galvanising force across government.""By Friday the 13th, Cummings had become the most outspoken advocate of a tough crackdown. ""Dominic himself had a conversion,"" a senior Tory said. ""He's gone from 'herd immunity and let the old people die', to 'let's shut down the country and the economy.'"" Cummings had a ""meeting of minds"" with Matt Hancock, the health secretary, who wanted stronger action to prevent NHS hospitals being swamped. Department of Health officials had impressed on Hancock that the death rate in Wuhan province was 3.4% when the hospitals were overrun and 0.7% elsewhere in China.Johnson had also been queasy about the previous original approach. ""Boris hated the language of 'herd immunity' because it implied that it was OK for people to die,"" a senior source said. ""Matt hated the language because it implied we had given up. You've got to fight.""HERD IMMUNITY The problem for the government was that at the moment herd immunity was being banished from policy, it had become the focus of publicity. That Wednesday, David Halpern of the Whitehall ""nudge unit"" put the phrase in the public domain. On Friday the 13th, Vallance repeated the idea on Radio 4. With Italy, France and Spain going into lockdown, the government's critics accused Johnson of refusing to act because he wanted people to get ill.Insiders say it was ""very bumpy"" that Friday. ""The meetings were very messy,"" said one source. But when Johnson gathered his key advisers in the cabinet room at 9.15am last Saturday there was unanimity. Whitty and Vallance explained that Britain had been four weeks behind Italy ""and now we are closer"".The two experts, together with Hancock and Cummings, all delivered to Johnson one message: ""Now is the moment to act."" The prime minister agreed: ""We must work around the clock and take all necessary measures."" One of those present said: ""The mood in the room was astonishing. You could tell that something very significant had shifted.""Flesh was added to the bones in another crunch meeting in Downing Street on Sunday night and again in the 9.15am meetings and bilaterals between Johnson and key cabinet ministers throughout last week.The media was briefed that elderly and vulnerable people might have to self-isolate for a period of months and that everyone else would have to engage in ""social distancing"" - working from home, avoiding groups and unnecessary outings. Most significantly, without a gargantuan package of support for businesses, renters and the self-employed, millions of jobs would be lost and the economy would collapse.THE ECONOMIC RESPONSE On Tuesday morning, as he prepared to unveil details of Britain's biggest peacetime financial package, Rishi Sunak, the chancellor, gathered his closest aides and officials in his book-lined study in 11 Downing Street. ""The scale of what is required is beyond anyone's current imagination,"" he said. ""We have to remove all limiting assumptions.""Over the weekend, Treasury officials worked through the night to prepare a package for business as if planning a full budget. ""They did three months' work in 48 hours,"" a Treasury source said. It helped that Charles Roxburgh, the second permanent secretary, and Andrew Bailey, the new governor of the Bank of England, were both veterans of the response to the 2008 financial crash.When he walked out with Johnson for a Downing Street news conference on Tuesday afternoon, aides were still finalising Sunak's comments as the statement came off the printer. The chancellor had no time to rehearse or to prepare for questions but gave an assured performance as he outlined plans for £350bn ((EURO)378bn) of government-backed loans and cash grants for business. ""We will do whatever it takes,"" he repeatedly intoned.Colleagues say Sunak's confidence came because he is deeply engaged ""in the weeds"" of the policy. ""Some ministers set the broad parameters for 15 minutes and the officials go away and do the work,"" said one source. ""He's more hands-on. He prefers a 30- to 40-minute meeting where he can properly kick the tyres and help solve the problems. He's across the detail.""Measures to help save jobs took longer, with a plan for the government to pay a high percentage of wages in cashstrapped firms finally being announced on Friday afternoon. Sunak agreed the package in a meeting with Johnson on Thursday night in which the pair shared a vegetarian takeaway pizza. The prime minister said: ""In 2008, the government looked after the bankers. Now we must make sure we look after the people first.""At 11.30pm the chancellor was sending messages to his permanent secretary thanking him for the ""superb"" work of some officials. A colleague said: ""He's got the brainpower. More importantly, he's got the character for this moment.""Sunak will need it because the risks are immense. One friend said: ""Rishi is very acutely aware that we are in danger of driving the economy off a cliff by shutting everything up. All this talk of bouncing straight back … we will have no airlines bounce straight back with if we're not careful.""The prime minister's big decision on Wednesday was that schools would close on Friday, a decision arrived at with Gavin Williamson, the education secretary.

You could tell that something very significant had shifted.""Flesh was added to the bones in another crunch meeting in Downing Street on Sunday night and again in the 9.15am meetings and bilaterals between Johnson and key cabinet ministers throughout last week.The media was briefed that elderly and vulnerable people might have to self-isolate for a period of months and that everyone else would have to engage in ""social distancing"" - working from home, avoiding groups and unnecessary outings. Most significantly, without a gargantuan package of support for businesses, renters and the self-employed, millions of jobs would be lost and the economy would collapse.THE ECONOMIC RESPONSE On Tuesday morning, as he prepared to unveil details of Britain's biggest peacetime financial package, Rishi Sunak, the chancellor, gathered his closest aides and officials in his book-lined study in 11 Downing Street. ""The scale of what is required is beyond anyone's current imagination,"" he said. ""We have to remove all limiting assumptions.""Over the weekend, Treasury officials worked through the night to prepare a package for business as if planning a full budget. ""They did three months' work in 48 hours,"" a Treasury source said. It helped that Charles Roxburgh, the second permanent secretary, and Andrew Bailey, the new governor of the Bank of England, were both veterans of the response to the 2008 financial crash.When he walked out with Johnson for a Downing Street news conference on Tuesday afternoon, aides were still finalising Sunak's comments as the statement came off the printer. The chancellor had no time to rehearse or to prepare for questions but gave an assured performance as he outlined plans for £350bn of government-backed loans and cash grants for business. ""We will do whatever it takes,"" he repeatedly intoned.Colleagues say Sunak's confidence came because he is deeply engaged ""in the weeds"" of the policy. ""Some ministers set the broad parameters for 15 minutes and the officials go away and do the work,"" said one source. ""He's more hands-on. He prefers a 30 to 40-minute meeting where he can properly kick the tyres and help solve the problems. He's across the detail.""Measures to help save jobs took longer, with a plan for the government to pay a high percentage of wages in cashstrapped firms finally being announced on Friday afternoon. Sunak agreed the package in a meeting with Johnson on Thursday night in which the pair shared a vegetarian takeaway pizza. The prime minister said: ""In 2008, the government looked after the bankers. Now we must make sure we look after the people first.""At 11.30pm the chancellor was sending messages to his permanent secretary thanking him for the ""superb"" work of some officials. A colleague said: ""He's got the brainpower. More importantly, he's got the character for this moment.""Sunak will need it because the risks are immense. One friend said: ""Rishi is very acutely aware that we are in danger of driving the economy off a cliff by shutting everything up. All this talk of bouncing straight back … we will have no airlines to bounce straight back with if we're not careful.""The prime minister's big decision on Wednesday was that schools would close on Friday, a decision arrived at with Gavin Williamson, the education secretary. They decided to act as many schools took matters into their own hands, to try to ensure childcare for key workers.It was another decision Johnson had resisted the week before, but cabinet ministers are clear that behind the scenes he has been far more decisive at crunch moments than his predecessor. ""He's been absolutely brilliant,"" said one. ""He makes decisions fast."" Another said: ""If Theresa May was still be in charge we would, by now, have just about signed off a request that people wash their hands."" Another cabinet source added: ""And if Philip Hammond was still chancellor he would have refused even to pay for that.""Nonetheless, even admirers admit that Johnson is not finding it easy to project the same decisiveness in his somewhat hesitant public appearances. ""He's a naturally cheerful person,"" one colleague said. ""He finds it difficult to deliver bad news."" Business leaders were surprised during a conference call on Monday, when he was trying to persuade them to build ventilators, to hear him describe the effort as ""Operation Last Gasp"".Whitty and Vallance began their own press conferences at the end of the week amid concern that some of Johnson's pronouncements - including a claim that they could ""turn the tide"" within 12 weeks - were not grounded in evidence. ""Some of the experts are appalled by some of his claims,"" a Whitehall source said. A Tory aide said: ""Boris looks haunted. It's like when George W Bush came in thinking he was going to be the education-reforming president and had to deal with the war on terror."" Another senior Tory said: ""Boris is shellshocked.""LOCKDOWN Johnson, who is a civil libertarian at heart, spent the week resisting Cummings's demands for a full-blown lockdown of London - banning inhabitants from travelling outside the city.Discussions about a shutdown were first aired at Cobra on Friday the 13th. By Tuesday the news was leaking after a Cabinet Office official emailed other departments to ask how a curfew might work. A Whitehall insider said: ""It was quickly established that the Paris model - with people being issued paperwork and allowed out of the family home one at a time would not work.""A senior Tory said: ""Boris really doesn't want to shut stuff down. He is more worried than most about the economic impact but also the social impact of locking people up in their homes for months. Fundamentally there is a Boris-Dom cleavage. First Boris bottled herd immunity. Now he's bottling lockdown.""Nonetheless, Johnson managed to fuel speculation that there would be troops on the streets and a travel ban by telling Wednesday's press conference that the government ""will not hesitate"" to take further steps. ""We live in a land of liberty,"" he said. ""But we will rule nothing out.""On Thursday the PM's spokesman was forced to say there were ""no plans"" to close down London transport and ""zero prospect"" of restrictions on travel. On Friday less draconian restrictions, closing pubs, clubs and restaurants nationwide, were unveiled. ""Whoever was briefing details of the full lockdown is bordering on a national security threat,"" said one Tory with links at the top of Whitehall. ""They are promulgating misinformation and spreading alarm."" Another source said the loose talk could have seen wealthy ""superspreaders"" flee London to infect people elsewhere: ""If you're going to do a lockdown you don't tell people first or you find they are all on the roof getting the last helicopter out of Saigon.""Nonetheless, Whitehall officials are quietly drawing up lists of key workers who would be issued with a travel permit if a full crackdown follows. Officials have also been working on a ""lockdown list"" of products that must be manufactured by law. They may yet be necessary. A minister said: ""We won't know for two weeks if the current measures are enough.""COMMUNICATION PROBLEMS On Thursday, after criticism from ministers and MPs that No 10 had failed to pro-vide clear messages to the public, Cummings and the communications director, Lee Cain, summoned the team who won the general election.Isaac Levido, the Tory campaign director, went to No 10, with former Vote Leave hands Paul Stephenson and Henry de Zoete on a video conference call. Together they devised a slogan ""Stay home. Save lives. Protect our NHS,"" which was rolled out on Friday.The No 10 morning meeting is now held on the Zoom video app to allow more home working. To try to raise morale, Johnson has also sent video messages thanking civil servants for their hard work. On Tuesday he returned from a morning run with his dog Dilyn to find his spokesman, James Slack, at the back of No 10 wishing his mother a happy birthday. Johnson took the phone and spoke to her for 10 minutes.However, many sources report that the Downing Street machine is fast running out of steam. ""Everyone is working to capacity and is absolutely exhausted,"" said one insider. ""It's utter chaos and there is no end in sight.""Businesses phoning up to offer help say Downing Street seems ""swamped"". One ventilator manufacturer claimed on Newsnight that the government had not put in any orders - though sources say 1,400 firms are offering to build them and by Friday morning eight companies who have never made a ventilator were turning them out.Some in Downing Street are turning to drink. An aide joked on Thursday that they had run out of hand sanitiser and were ""using the contents of a vodka miniature"" instead. Others are recruiting old friends. Gabriel Milland, a former head of press to Michael Gove, was drafted into No 10 last week. Tom Shinner, the civil servant who did the most to prepare Britain for a no-deal Brexit, who left the government last year, has also been rehired.MINISTERIAL INFIGHTING The toll is telling on ministers and tensions between them have bubbled over. ""It's miserable and horrible and you just have to get on with it,"" a cabinet minister said.The ""core four"" in all the key meetings are the chairmen of four inter-ministerial committees: Dominic Raab, the foreign secretary, who chairs the international committee; Sunak, who chairs the economic committee; Hancock, who chairs the health committee; and Gove, who chairs the other public sector committee.Numerous sources say Gove has repeatedly sniped at Hancock. ""There have been tensions over where responsibilities begin and end,"" one observed. Some ministers are lobbying to see Gove take charge if Johnson is incapacitated with Covid-19 or if he takes paternity leave, though Sunak ranks higher in the cabinet rankings on the www.gov.uk website and the job is likely to be Raab's, since he is officially ""first secretary of state"".But a minister said: ""Considering the scale of the massive decisions we have been making it has been remarkably collegiate.""Ministers hope the dramatic events of the last week will reduce the likely death toll from Covid-19 to ""a bad seasonal flu"", which means tens, not hundreds, of thousands of deaths. The worst recent year was 2014-15 when 28,000 people died.But there are perils ahead. ""Boris and his team are absolutely terrified because it will not be the NHS by end of this,"" a Whitehall source said. ""It will be the corona health service and will just be there to pump oxygen into patients.""MPs speculate that there will be two big inquiries - an international one into the origins of the virus in China's live animal ""wet markets""; and a second into the government's preparations and policy decisions. ""If we end up like Italy in two weeks' time and 30-year-old doctors are dropping dead, the government is going to be in big trouble,"" a Labour MP said.SHAKING THE WORLD Amid the frenzy of events, more thoughtful Tories have concluded that the decisions taken last week will change three key aspects of the way the world works. One said: ""One is the debate around globalisation. Is Trump right that we just need to build bigger walls, or is Gordon Brown right that global problems need global solutions? The second is Socialism v The Free Market. Large parts of the economy are going to be socialised after this. I fear it leads to nationalists and socialists winning, to national socialism.""The third fissure may yet be the worst.""It's the intergenerational question. It is unsustainable to have people in their youth put their whole life on hold for months while the economy tanks to save a 91-year-old who would have died six months later anyway.""Whatever the outcome, ministers have little doubt about the significance of the virus. ""It's shaking the world,"" one said. Another, who has been up to his neck in the dramas of the past three years, was more prosaic: ""My obituary gets more interesting every week.""The sadness is that there will be many other obituaries to be written too.The PM was told: Now is the moment to actDon't tell people you're going into lockdown or they'll all be getting on the last helicopter out",Newspaper

A moment when they sat ""shellshocked"", reflecting on choices that will change Britain for the rest of our lives. ""It took us the weekend to get ourselves into the emotional position where we were comfortable taking the decisions we took,"" a minister said. ""They were massive.""In politics, there is so much overstatement. Not this time. Ten days ago the government was slowly gearing up its response to the coronavirus crisis, downplaying the need for drastic measures. By Monday, Boris Johnson had ordered an expansion of the state not seen since the Second World War to save the National Health Service, an institution formed in the cauldron of that conflict. A wartimestyle lockdown of the capital was under active consideration.This weekend, the events of the last week have already changed health policy, changed the economy and are already changing the people involved.The last time the British state began a multiple service attack on a lurking enemy - D-Day in 1944 - it became known as The Longest Day. On Thursday one cabinet minister reflected: ""It feels like the longest week. It felt like Brexit was going to change the country but it is the coronavirus that will do that now.""Senior figures in government are insistent that the changes they made to the virus clampdown were not ""a U-turn"" but a vehicle accelerating faster along a track already laid. In truth, they no more resemble what went before than the space shuttle did a Citroën 2CV.Conversations with more than a dozen ministers and cabinet ministers, special advisers, Downing Street staff and civil servants reveal a human drama, of leaders tested as never before and of the single most frightening warning a British prime minister has received in eight decades.A SHOCK TO THE SYSTEM The meeting that will change British society for a generation took place on the evening of Thursday, March 12. That was when the strategic advisory group of experts (Sage in Whitehall parlance), the government's committee of scientists and medics, gathered to examine modelling from experts at Imperial College London and other institutions.The results were shattering. A week earlier, councils had been warned to expect about 100,000 deaths from Covid-19. Now Chris Whitty, the chief medical officer, and Sir Patrick Vallance, the chief scientific adviser, realised the estimates were wrong.""Unmitigated, the death number was 510,000,"" a senior figure said. ""Mitigated we were told it was going to be 250,000. Once you see a figure of take no further action and a quarter of a million people die, the question you ask is, 'What action?'"" Another insider said: ""There was a collision between the science and reality.""Ministers had been on notice that drastic action might be needed since the virus first emerged in China's Wuhan province in December. In January, Whitty told the cabinet: ""It either stays in China or it will get everywhere."" For two months the government had time to prepare, but Johnson's instincts were to resist a lifechanging crackdown. ""There was a lot of talk about how this was just a bit of flu,"" one senior Tory recalled.Dominic Cummings, the prime minister's senior aide, became convinced that Britain would be better able to resist a lethal second wave of the disease next winter if Whitty's prediction that 60% to 80% of the population became infected was right and the UK developed ""herd immunity"".At a private engagement at the end of February, Cummings outlined the government's strategy. Those present say it was ""herd immunity, protect the economy and if that means some pensioners die, too bad"".At the Sage meeting on March 12, a moment now dubbed the ""Domoscene conversion"", Cummings changed his mind. In this ""penny-drop moment"", he realised he had helped set a course for catastrophe. Until this point, the rise in British infections had been below the European average. Now they were above it and on course to emulate Italy, where the picture was bleak. A minister said: ""Seeing what was happening in Italy was the galvanising force across government.""By Friday the 13th, Cummings had become the most outspoken advocate of a tough crackdown. ""Dominic himself had a conversion,"" a senior Tory said. ""He's gone from 'herd immunity and let the old people die', to 'let's shut down the country and the economy.'"" Cummings had a ""meeting of minds"" with Matt Hancock, the health secretary, who wanted stronger action to prevent NHS hospitals being swamped. Department of Health officials had impressed on Hancock that the death rate in Wuhan province was 3.4% when the hospitals were overrun and 0.7% elsewhere in China.Johnson had also been queasy about the previous original approach. ""Boris hated the language of 'herd immunity' because it implied that it was OK for people to die,"" a senior source said. ""Matt hated the language because it implied we had given up. You've got to fight.""HERD IMMUNITY The problem for the government was that at the moment herd immunity was being banished from policy, it had become the focus of publicity. That Wednesday, David Halpern of the Whitehall ""nudge unit"" put the phrase in the public domain. On Friday the 13th, Vallance repeated the idea on Radio 4. With Italy, France and Spain going into lockdown, the government's critics accused Johnson of refusing to act because he wanted people to get ill.Insiders say it was ""very bumpy"" that Friday. ""The meetings were very messy,"" said one source. But when Johnson gathered his key advisers in the cabinet room at 9.15am last Saturday there was unanimity. Whitty and Vallance explained that Britain had been four weeks behind Italy ""and now we are closer"".The two experts, together with Hancock and Cummings, all delivered to Johnson one message: ""Now is the moment to act.""

""Boris hated the language of 'herd immunity' because it implied that it was OK for people to die,"" a senior source said. ""Matt hated the language because it implied we had given up. You've got to fight.""HERD IMMUNITY The problem for the government was that at the moment herd immunity was being banished from policy, it had become the focus of publicity. That Wednesday, David Halpern of the Whitehall ""nudge unit"" put the phrase in the public domain. On Friday the 13th, Vallance repeated the idea on Radio 4. With Italy, France and Spain going into lockdown, the government's critics accused Johnson of refusing to act because he wanted people to get ill.Insiders say it was ""very bumpy"" that Friday. ""The meetings were very messy,"" said one source. But when Johnson gathered his key advisers in the cabinet room at 9.15am last Saturday there was unanimity. Whitty and Vallance explained that Britain had been four weeks behind Italy ""and now we are closer"".The two experts, together with Hancock and Cummings, all delivered to Johnson one message: ""Now is the moment to act."" The prime minister agreed: ""We must work around the clock and take all necessary measures."" One of those present said: ""The mood in the room was astonishing. You could tell that something very significant had shifted.""Flesh was added to the bones in another crunch meeting in Downing Street on Sunday night and again in the 9.15am meetings and bilaterals between Johnson and key cabinet ministers throughout last week.The media was briefed that elderly and vulnerable people might have to self-isolate for a period of months and that everyone else would have to engage in ""social distancing"" - working from home, avoiding groups and unnecessary outings. Most significantly, without a gargantuan package of support for businesses, renters and the self-employed, millions of jobs would be lost and the economy would collapse.THE ECONOMIC RESPONSE On Tuesday morning, as he prepared to unveil details of Britain's biggest peacetime financial package, Rishi Sunak, the chancellor, gathered his closest aides and officials in his book-lined study in 11 Downing Street. ""The scale of what is required is beyond anyone's current imagination,"" he said. ""We have to remove all limiting assumptions.""Over the weekend, Treasury officials worked through the night to prepare a package for business as if planning a full budget. ""They did three months' work in 48 hours,"" a Treasury source said. It helped that Charles Roxburgh, the second permanent secretary, and Andrew Bailey, the new governor of the Bank of England, were both veterans of the response to the 2008 financial crash.When he walked out with Johnson for a Downing Street news conference on Tuesday afternoon, aides were still finalising Sunak's comments as the statement came off the printer. The chancellor had no time to rehearse or to prepare for questions but gave an assured performance as he outlined plans for £350bn of government-backed loans and cash grants for business. ""We will do whatever it takes,"" he repeatedly intoned.Colleagues say Sunak's confidence came because he is deeply engaged ""in the weeds"" of the policy. ""Some ministers set the broad parameters for 15 minutes and the officials go away and do the work,"" said one source. ""He's more hands-on. He prefers a 30 to 40-minute meeting where he can properly kick the tyres and help solve the problems. He's across the detail.""Measures to help save jobs took longer, with a plan for the government to pay a high percentage of wages in cashstrapped firms finally being announced on Friday afternoon. Sunak agreed the package in a meeting with Johnson on Thursday night in which the pair shared a vegetarian takeaway pizza. The prime minister said: ""In 2008, the government looked after the bankers. Now we must make sure we look after the people first.""At 11.30pm the chancellor was sending messages to his permanent secretary thanking him for the ""superb"" work of some officials. A colleague said: ""He's got the brainpower. More importantly, he's got the character for this moment.""Sunak will need it because the risks are immense. One friend said: ""Rishi is very acutely aware that we are in danger of driving the economy off a cliff by shutting everything up. All this talk of bouncing straight back … we will have no airlines to bounce straight back with if we're not careful.""The prime minister's big decision on Wednesday was that schools would close on Friday, a decision arrived at with Gavin Williamson, the education secretary. They decided to act as many schools took matters into their own hands, to try to ensure childcare for key workers.It was another decision Johnson had resisted the week before, but cabinet ministers are clear that behind the scenes he has been far more decisive at crunch moments than his predecessor. ""He's been absolutely brilliant,"" said one. ""He makes decisions fast."" Another said: ""If Theresa May was still be in charge we would, by now, have just about signed off a request that people wash their hands."" Another cabinet source added: ""And if Philip Hammond was still chancellor he would have refused even to pay for that.""Nonetheless, even admirers admit that Johnson is not finding it easy to project the same decisiveness in his somewhat hesitant public appearances. ""He's a naturally cheerful person,"" one colleague said. ""He finds it difficult to deliver bad news."" Business leaders were surprised during a conference call on Monday, when he was trying to persuade them to build ventilators, to hear him describe the effort as ""Operation Last Gasp"".Whitty and Vallance began their own press conferences at the end of the week amid concern that some of Johnson's pronouncements - including a claim that they could ""turn the tide"" within 12 weeks - were not grounded in evidence. ""Some of the experts are appalled by some of his claims,"" a Whitehall source said. A Tory aide said: ""Boris looks haunted. It's like when George W Bush came in thinking he was going to be the education-reforming president and had to deal with the war on terror."" Another senior Tory said: ""Boris is shellshocked.""LOCKDOWN Johnson, who is a civil libertarian at heart, spent the week resisting Cummings's demands for a full-blown lockdown of London - banning inhabitants from travelling outside the city.Discussions about a shutdown were first aired at Cobra on Friday the 13th. By Tuesday the news was leaking after a Cabinet Office official emailed other departments to ask how a curfew might work. A Whitehall insider said: ""It was quickly established that the Paris model - with people being issued paperwork and allowed out of the family home one at a time would not work.""A senior Tory said: ""Boris really doesn't want to shut stuff down. He is more worried than most about the economic impact but also the social impact of locking people up in their homes for months. Fundamentally there is a Boris-Dom cleavage. First Boris bottled herd immunity. Now he's bottling lockdown.""Nonetheless, Johnson managed to fuel speculation that there would be troops on the streets and a travel ban by telling Wednesday's press conference that the government ""will not hesitate"" to take further steps. ""We live in a land of liberty,"" he said. ""But we will rule nothing out.""On Thursday the PM's spokesman was forced to say there were ""no plans"" to close down London transport and ""zero prospect"" of restrictions on travel. On Friday less draconian restrictions, closing pubs, clubs and restaurants nationwide, were unveiled. ""Whoever was briefing details of the full lockdown is bordering on a national security threat,"" said one Tory with links at the top of Whitehall. ""They are promulgating misinformation and spreading alarm."" Another source said the loose talk could have seen wealthy ""superspreaders"" flee London to infect people elsewhere: ""If you're going to do a lockdown you don't tell people first or you find they are all on the roof getting the last helicopter out of Saigon.""Nonetheless, Whitehall officials are quietly drawing up lists of key workers who would be issued with a travel permit if a full crackdown follows. Officials have also been working on a ""lockdown list"" of products that must be manufactured by law. They may yet be necessary. A minister said: ""We won't know for two weeks if the current measures are enough.""COMMUNICATION PROBLEMS On Thursday, after criticism from ministers and MPs that No 10 had failed to pro-vide clear messages to the public, Cummings and the communications director, Lee Cain, summoned the team who won the general election.Isaac Levido, the Tory campaign director, went to No 10, with former Vote Leave hands Paul Stephenson and Henry de Zoete on a video conference call. Together they devised a slogan ""Stay home. Save lives. Protect our NHS,"" which was rolled out on Friday.The No 10 morning meeting is now held on the Zoom video app to allow more home working. To try to raise morale, Johnson has also sent video messages thanking civil servants for their hard work. On Tuesday he returned from a morning run with his dog Dilyn to find his spokesman, James Slack, at the back of No 10 wishing his mother a happy birthday. Johnson took the phone and spoke to her for 10 minutes.However, many sources report that the Downing Street machine is fast running out of steam. ""Everyone is working to capacity and is absolutely exhausted,"" said one insider. ""It's utter chaos and there is no end in sight.""Businesses phoning up to offer help say Downing Street seems ""swamped"". One ventilator manufacturer claimed on Newsnight that the government had not put in any orders - though sources say 1,400 firms are offering to build them and by Friday morning eight companies who have never made a ventilator were turning them out.Some in Downing Street are turning to drink. An aide joked on Thursday that they had run out of hand sanitiser and were ""using the contents of a vodka miniature"" instead. Others are recruiting old friends. Gabriel Milland, a former head of press to Michael Gove, was drafted into No 10 last week. Tom Shinner, the civil servant who did the most to prepare Britain for a no-deal Brexit, who left the government last year, has also been rehired.MINISTERIAL INFIGHTING The toll is telling on ministers and tensions between them have bubbled over. ""It's miserable and horrible and you just have to get on with it,"" a cabinet minister said.The ""core four"" in all the key meetings are the chairmen of four inter-ministerial committees: Dominic Raab, the foreign secretary, who chairs the international committee; Sunak, who chairs the economic committee; Hancock, who chairs the health committee; and Gove, who chairs the other public sector committee.Numerous sources say Gove has repeatedly sniped at Hancock. ""There have been tensions over where responsibilities begin and end,"" one observed. Some ministers are lobbying to see Gove take charge if Johnson is incapacitated with Covid-19 or if he takes paternity leave, though Sunak ranks higher in the cabinet rankings on the www.gov.uk website and the job is likely to be Raab's, since he is officially ""first secretary of state"".But a minister said: ""Considering the scale of the massive decisions we have been making it has been remarkably collegiate.""Ministers hope the dramatic events of the last week will reduce the likely death toll from Covid-19 to ""a bad seasonal flu"", which means tens, not hundreds, of thousands of deaths. The worst recent year was 2014-15 when 28,000 people died.But there are perils ahead. ""Boris and his team are absolutely terrified because it will not be the NHS by end of this,"" a Whitehall source said. ""It will be the corona health service and will just be there to pump oxygen into patients.""MPs speculate that there will be two big inquiries - an international one into the origins of the virus in China's live animal ""wet markets""; and a second into the government's preparations and policy decisions. ""If we end up like Italy in two weeks' time and 30-year-old doctors are dropping dead, the government is going to be in big trouble,"" a Labour MP said.SHAKING THE WORLD Amid the frenzy of events, more thoughtful Tories have concluded that the decisions taken last week will change three key aspects of the way the world works. One said: ""One is the debate around globalisation. Is Trump right that we just need to build bigger walls, or is Gordon Brown right that global problems need global solutions? The second is Socialism v The Free Market. Large parts of the economy are going to be socialised after this. I fear it leads to nationalists and socialists winning, to national socialism.""The third fissure may yet be the worst.""It's the intergenerational question. It is unsustainable to have people in their youth put their whole life on hold for months while the economy tanks to save a 91-year-old who would have died six months later anyway.""Whatever the outcome, ministers have little doubt about the significance of the virus. ""It's shaking the world,"" one said. Another, who has been up to his neck in the dramas of the past three years, was more prosaic: ""My obituary gets more interesting every week.""The sadness is that there will be many other obituaries to be written too.The PM was told: Now is the moment to actDon't tell people you're going into lockdown or they'll all be getting on the last helicopter out",Newspaper
191,"Ten days that shook Britain - and changed the nation for ever;The inside story of how Boris Johnson changed his priorities: save lives first, and then salvage the economy","March 22, 2020 Sunday",International,The Sunday Times (London),3038,3038,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,TIM SHIPMAN; CAROLINE WHEELER,"Ten days that shook Britain - and changed the nation for everThe inside story of how Boris Johnson changed his priorities: save lives first, and then salvage the economy","There was a moment, when the decisions were made, when they wondered what on earth they had done, how far they had been forced to go. A moment when they sat ""shellshocked"", reflecting on choices that will change Britain for the rest of our lives. ""It took us the weekend to get ourselves into the emotional position where we were comfortable taking the decisions we took,"" a minister said. ""They were massive.""In politics, there is so much overstatement. Not this time. Ten days ago the government was slowly gearing up its response to the coronavirus crisis, downplaying the need for drastic measures. By Monday, Boris Johnson had ordered an expansion of the state not seen since the Second World War to save the National Health Service, an institution formed in the cauldron of that conflict. A wartimestyle lockdown of the capital was under active consideration.This weekend, the events of the last week have already changed health policy, changed the economy and are already changing the people involved.The last time the British state began a multiple service attack on a lurking enemy - D-Day in 1944 - it became known as The Longest Day. On Thursday one cabinet minister reflected: ""It feels like the longest week. It felt like Brexit was going to change the country but it is the coronavirus that will do that now.""Senior figures in government are insistent that the changes they made to the virus clampdown were not ""a U-turn"" but a vehicle accelerating faster along a track already laid. In truth, they no more resemble what went before than the space shuttle did a Citroën 2CV.Conversations with more than a dozen ministers and cabinet ministers, special advisers, Downing Street staff and civil servants reveal a human drama, of leaders tested as never before and of the single most frightening warning a British prime minister has received in eight decades.A SHOCK TO THE SYSTEM The meeting that will change British society for a generation took place on the evening of Thursday, March 12. That was when the strategic advisory group of experts (Sage in Whitehall parlance), the government's committee of scientists and medics, gathered to examine modelling from experts at Imperial College London and other institutions.The results were shattering. A week earlier, councils had been warned to expect about 100,000 deaths from Covid-19. Now Chris Whitty, the chief medical officer, and Sir Patrick Vallance, the chief scientific adviser, realised the estimates were wrong.""Unmitigated, the death number was 510,000,"" a senior figure said. ""Mitigated we were told it was going to be 250,000. Once you see a figure of take no further action and a quarter of a million people die, the question you ask is, 'What action?'"" Another insider said: ""There was a collision between the science and reality.""Ministers had been on notice that drastic action might be needed since the virus first emerged in China's Wuhan province in December. In January, Whitty told the cabinet: ""It either stays in China or it will get everywhere."" For two months the government had time to prepare, but Johnson's instincts were to resist a lifechanging crackdown. ""There was a lot of talk about how this was just a bit of flu,"" one senior Tory recalled.Dominic Cummings, the prime minister's senior aide, became convinced that Britain would be better able to resist a lethal second wave of the disease next winter if Whitty's prediction that 60% to 80% of the population became infected was right and the UK developed ""herd immunity"".At a private engagement at the end of February, Cummings outlined the government's strategy. Those present say it was ""herd immunity, protect the economy and if that means some pensioners die, too bad"".At the Sage meeting on March 12, a moment now dubbed the ""Domoscene conversion"", Cummings changed his mind. In this ""penny-drop moment"", he realised he had helped set a course for catastrophe. Until this point, the rise in British infections had been below the European average. Now they were above it and on course to emulate Italy, where the picture was bleak. A minister said: ""Seeing what was happening in Italy was the galvanising force across government.""By Friday the 13th, Cummings had become the most outspoken advocate of a tough crackdown. ""Dominic himself had a conversion,"" a senior Tory said. ""He's gone from 'herd immunity and let the old people die', to 'let's shut down the country and the economy.'"" Cummings had a ""meeting of minds"" with Matt Hancock, the health secretary, who wanted stronger action to prevent NHS hospitals being swamped. Department of Health officials had impressed on Hancock that the death rate in Wuhan province was 3.4% when the hospitals were overrun and 0.7% elsewhere in China.Johnson had also been queasy about the previous original approach. ""Boris hated the language of 'herd immunity' because it implied that it was OK for people to die,"" a senior source said. ""Matt hated the language because it implied we had given up.

192,HOW YOUR ANCESTORS ARE MAKING YOU BUY LOO ROLLS AND SELL SHARES,"March 22, 2020 Sunday",International,The Daily Mail and Mail on Sunday (London),1020,1020,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,BY ROSIE MURRAY WEST,HOW YOUR ANCESTORS ARE MAKING YOU BUY LOO ROLLS AND SELL SHARES,"INVESTMENT legend Warren Buffett famously encouraged investors to be fearful when others are greedy, and greedy when others are fearful.' But it's hard to hold your nerve like the Sage of Omaha in these times of unprecedented uncertainty, when 30 per cent of the stock market's value has been wiped away since the start of the year.It feels impossible to know whether you should be buying, selling or holding that nerve, but experts say that the first step towards making the right decision is to learn about the human fear response - and then apply these lessons to your investment strategy.Sian MacInnes is a chartered independent financial adviser with Burford-based Philip James Financial Services. She has spent the past couple of weeks reassuring clients.She says: Investors react to fear in much the same way as they do to other threats in their lives. Flight or fight. Unfortunately, they can't fight the stock market so the natural instinct is to run away and withdraw all of their investments and capitalise their losses.'Learning about so-called behavioural finance - the study of the influence of psychology on the behaviour of investors - will help you avoid making investment mistakes you will regret later when markets have calmed down.Neil Bage is founder of behavioural finance consultancy Be-IQ in London. He says most investors are currently blinded by fear'.He adds: It's such a fluid and evolving situation and people don't know when the market's slide is going to stop. We're in a position that we haven't been in for a long, long time.'At times like this, Bage says investors fall back on a series of decision-making behaviours that were honed long ago, when our ancestors were hunter-gatherers. We've seen it in investing, and also in panic-buying on the high street,' he says. Fear kicks in biologically.'Bage says that due to a phenomenon called loss aversion', which may have developed to keep our ancestors safe, we feel losses roughly twice as much as gains - meaning it is exceptionally painful when stock markets fall. It prevents us from making good decisions. Investors, he says, combine this with other negative behaviours such as regret aversion', where we think about the worst possible outcome and then choose the option that best minimises that - rather then the most sensible choice.Whether our behaviour prompts us to sell shares or to stockpile toilet paper, for example, Bage says we can beat it.He says talking to an adviser or a trusted friend can help investors make clearer - and more rational - investment decisions. Such advisers and friends can act like a counsellor or a therapist,' he says. Greg Davies, head of behavioural science at investment risk business Oxford Risk, agrees. He says: There is a constant tension in all of us - between doing the sensible thing and doing what is comfortable. The need for emotional comfort often triumphs.'While not losing your head is vital, there may also be investment opportunities - as long as you are careful.Lee Wild is head of equity strategy at wealth manager Interactive Investor.

This bias means that we often hold on to investments long after they've become irrelevant to our goals. REGRET AVERSION: This is where people think about the worst possible outcome and how they would feel if that outcome was realised. This leads people to choose options that reduce or eliminate the chance of regret, even if the decision is not the right one. STATUS QUO BIAS: This is when people prefer things to stay the same by doing nothing or by sticking with a choice that they have already made. This is one of the reasons people often choose default investment funds in their pension - the one offered initially by their provider - or refuse to change a losing investment strategy.DISPOSITION EFFECT: This is where we tend to hold on to losing investments for too long while selling winning investments too quickly. This is closely linked to loss aversion. HERDING BIAS: Nothing to do with herd immunity. This is simply a compulsion to follow the crowd - and a natural discomfort when you feel that you are going out on a limb.© Mail On Sunday",Papers

This skill protected them from violence and dangerous diseases, and ensured the survival of their groups. While this survival instinct is not needed today, an innate fear of ""the other"" persists. Bias against those who do not look and act like us continues to be a crucial part of human psychology - and we do it subconsciously. If we can only understand this unconscious bias, we can begin to tackle its damaging manifestations: discrimination and prejudice.Sway is a comprehensive and forensic look at unconscious bias and its myriad manifestations in modern life. The book's author is behavioural scientist Dr Pragya Agarwal - a first-generation Indian immigrant married to a white Scottish husband, with mixed-race children - for whom bias has been inescapable. She calls for us to understand all kinds of unconscious bias in order to build a better society.At times the scrutiny of so many forms of bias makes the book read like a tedious encyclopaedia, and many of the cases feel rather trivial: right-hand in scissors; bias against particular letters in names; bias in diagrams in anatomy textbooks. Counterintuitively, this can make the problem feel too widespread to dismantle.Much of the discussion, however, is centred on issues the vast majority of readers will relate to - the mechanics and effects of bias against women, for instance, for which our inherent biases in favour of ""masculine"" traits are to blame. But while studies have shown that men are just as unhappy with their appearance as women, and are three times more likely to commit suicide in the UK, the effects of gendered stereotypes on men receive little mention - a disappointing oversight.Agarwal leaves the best until last, with her most compelling analysis coming in the penultimate chapter, about artificial intelligence (AI). When used by companies such as Amazon, AI has already been shown to discriminate against women's CVs and has had an abysmal record when it comes to race.Whether it is Google mislabelling black people as ""gorillas"" in photos or self-driving cars being more likely to hit people of colour, there is strong evidence that AI has in-built unconscious racism. These biases are inherited from those who make the technology, who are overwhelmingly white and male, and less inclined to consider the unintended consequences of technology on women and non-white ""others"". Rightly, Agarwal calls for better representation for women and ethnic minorities in the field, as well as more accountability and transparency in AI. With this new technology increasingly infiltrating every part of modern life, this call to action seems to be a big piece of the puzzle in tackling the omnipresence of bias as we look to the future. That it doesn't play a more prominent role in the book is disappointing.Another concern is the author's occasional hypocrisy. At one point she describes diversity in the Conservative Party's cabinet as ""virtue signalling"", going as far as putting the word ""diverse"" in quotation marks to suggest she considers it somehow illegitimate. This smacks of her bias against ethnicminority Conservatives, who are often dismissed as mere tokens. Her framing of Brexit as a decision that was primarily driven by a fear of migrant invasion is also a skewed, even ignorant interpretation. Polling data has consistently shown that national sovereignty was the most cited concern.Elsewhere, Agarwal describes Barack Obama as representing ""a different kind of black masculinity, more in touch with his emotions and comfortable in showing them"", despite her staunch critique of language that legitimises notions of ""masculinity"", let alone ""black masculinity"". The author's willingness to make these sloppy characterisations shamefully exposes her own bias.Ultimately, this book, an attempt to elucidate unconscious bias, serves to complicate it further. Agarwal dedicates far too much time to overloading us with information and not enough to setting out a vision for the future.

I'm not talking about his sensible ideas to leverage the state's balance sheet - coronavirus permitting - to fund a proper national housebuilding scheme. Rather, a plan to make houses look less grotty.I gather that Desmond's investment arm IIU has a 50% stake in Welsh company Brickspan Developments, which is working on a novel way of tacking brick facades onto houses. They come on a roll and are like laminated flooring for walls.Desmond has plonked his trusted lieutenant Niall O hEineachain onto the leadership team of the Pontypool firm, which has developed the Brickspan product.Construction, particularly in the homebuilding space, is highly inefficient and labour intensive, so mass-producing more parts centrally and assembling them on site is clearly the future.With homebuilding likely to ramp up during the recovery, there's an opportunity for Desmond and Brickspan to make hay.Not much need for it on Shrewsbury Road, mind.

Dowling, a founder of TransferMate with Terry Clune, exited in 2017 before the payments company took investment from AIB and later ING. McGuirk was chief executive of Clune's Taxback group before leaving to set up Payslip.It's a small world.                   4Impacts makes a healthy diversion for O'Callaghan                   Munster and Ireland rugby legend Donncha O'Callaghan is making the move from professional sport into the commercial world look easy.

Dawson joins the backer herd at Content Llama                   Coronavirus-related social distancing has led to the temporary closure of many bricks-and-mortar stores, pushing more of them online to get sales. Certain sectors, such as fashion, are finding it harder than others to trade online, as having accurate product details is a big problem.Joleen Looney and Karina Kelly's Content Llama may have come up with something clever here. The Donegal company provides error-free, high-quality images, videos and detailed descriptions for stores, which streamlines the process of uploading stock. Potentially, 50 tasks are reduced to one, slashing the time to prepare saleable stock.I'm told that Michael Dawson, who sold the One4all voucher company to American firm Blackhawk for (EURO)100m in 2018, has invested in Content Llama.Dawson, who had a 10.5% stake in the business, was ahead of the game with his vouchering company.

Her Instagram account has 285,000 followers, scoring nine million impressions a week.Jackson has now set up a venture called Pixiebel, with her partner Dylan O'Connor. Pixiebel has borrowed money from Jackson's parent company, Glowbelle, through a mortgage against their old residence. Their new pad in Malahide cost (EURO)1.73m, so things are clearly going well in her sphere of influence.SoSueMe had accumulated profits of more than (EURO)1.5m at the end of 2018, with at least two-thirds of that lent out to other Jackson lines.Jackson also has a joint cosmetics venture with the businessman Fran O'Gorman. Sundrelle, a beauty products distribution company, paid its four directors, O'Gorman included, a handsome (EURO)3.6m in 2018.

197,Don't mock the panic-buyers in Asda. Ask why Boris Johnson lost the public's trust;The guidance on coronavirus changes by the hour. No wonder confusion abounds,"March 23, 2020 Monday",International,The Independent (United Kingdom),1599,1599,England & Wales,Tom Peck,Don't mock the panic-buyers in Asda. Ask why Boris Johnson lost the public's trustThe guidance on coronavirus changes by the hour. No wonder confusion abounds,"At the end of a weekend in which the nation was meant to be on self-enforced coronavirus lockdown, but the parks and streets and markets appeared to look more like the carnival scene in Ferris Bueller's Day Off, it is perhaps worth a quick **record scratch** **freeze frame** to try and work out how we got here.It's not merely that in a pre-recorded statement on Monday night, weighed down with as much personal gravity as the unbearably light prime minister could manage, he enforced a lockdown he has several times ruled out.That is one of the more straightforward aspects of confusion to wrap one's head around. It is harder to understand why it has not happened already. It is very easy to shout abuse at the throngs of people photographed in, say, Victoria Park food market on Sunday lunchtime. We know it's easy because Piers Morgan has done it.It's very easy to either laugh or cry at the vast queues of non-socially distanced shoppers outside your local Asda.But there can be no doubt that people are profoundly confused about what they should and shouldn't and can and cannot do, and there can be no doubt that that is not entirely their fault.Whenever the advice on coronavirus appears to contradict itself, the stock answer, from Boris Johnson or from his leading scientific advisors, is that all that has changed is the speed through which we are moving through the gears of a fixed plan. But even within that context, the information meted out to the British public, who don't all necessarily pay as much attention to what's been said as a political journalist might, has been a truly impenetrable mess.                     Read more                   •How to help the elderly and vulnerable during the coronavirus•How to feel less anxious about the coronavirus•How to be productive when working from home during coronavirus•Which countries around the world has coronavirus spread to?•The dirty truth about washing your handsOn Sunday evening, Johnson gave a press conference, standing alongside the deputy chief medical officer, Jenny Harries, in which he made it clear that the public would have to stop congregating in public or face new coronavirus enforcement measures.On March 10th, not even two weeks ago, Dr Jenny Harries was interviewed on BBC Breakfast, and when asked why the Cheltenham Festival was ongoing, and the weekend's Premier League football fixtures had not been cancelled, she said the following: ""The virus won't survive very long outside. It will lose its viability to transmit disease, and so many outdoor events particularly are relatively safe.""For many of us watching, that was something of a seismic intervention. The nation does not need armchair epidemiologists, and for those of us who had been tentatively wondering whether it was not slightly mad that millions of people were about to start cramming into giant stadiums all weekend, this provided reassurance. Two days later, the Premier League announced that a full weekend's football fixtures would go ahead. Had the Arsenal manager, Mikel Arteta, and the Chelsea player, Calum Hudson-Odoi, not tested positive for coronavirus, it is more than reasonable to imagine those matches would have continued as usual.Now we are meant to accept - indeed we must accept - that the Victoria Park food market poses a mortal threat, when not a fortnight ago, when France, Italy, Spain, Belgium and much of the US were bringing in the kind of shutdown that is now a certainty here, we were publicly reassured that football matches were fine.The weekend's devastating write-ups of the last 10 days, principally in The Sunday Times, suggest that even the government's panel of scientific advisors were divided on the correct way forward, which certainly goes some way to explaining why the public seem so unable to find consensus themselves about what they are meant to be doing.On Friday March 13, Sir Patrick Vallance told Sky News that ""herd immunity"" would be required to beat coronavirus, which would involve 60 per cent of the population becoming infected. Professor David Halpern, the head of the Behavioural Insights Team, better known as the nudge unit, used the term in a television interview. Two days later, the Health Secretary Matt Hancock would write in The Daily Telegraph: ""We have a plan, based on the expertise of world-leading scientists. Herd immunity is not a part of it. That is a scientific concept, not a goal or a strategy.""We now know that the approach changed after the terrifying findings by the Imperial College scientists, that the plan risked 250,000 deaths. I say ""we."" Many people don't know. Many people don't follow it that closely. They don't have a clue what's going on, and no small factor in that is the government saying something is ""not part"" of the plan, when what they mean is that it's not part of the plan anymore.The role of the prime minister in all of this is nothing short of stunning. Can it really be barely a fortnight since he appeared on live television, bragging about going on a hospital visit and shaking hands with coronavirus patients, and then had his spinners quietly seek to correct the record? That one's own eyes and ears are no longer meant to be believed?On Friday evening, asked whether he would see his mother on Mother's Day, he told the nation, ""I hope I'll get to see her."" On Saturday night, after 10pm, a further statement was issued, urging the country to ""do the right thing"" and not see mum this Mother's Day. Even for those half-paying attention, this news will not have arrived until Mother's Day itself, which is a touch late to change one's plans. Matt Hancock says the government is expanding the amount of coronavirus testingThe panic-buyers are mocked, even though they have been given every reason to panic. News of quarantining the over-70s for four months appears late on a Saturday night on Robert Peston's blog, and a week later, it doesn't appear to be happening at all.(Various doctors still insist to me that this plan is by far the most sensible. A forcible lockdown for those vulnerable, and an attempt to achieve some sort of herd immunity among the rest. Though we trust the experts, even though they don't appear to trust one another, it is not being pursued.)London is going to be locked down, say the newspapers. Then Boris Johnson says it can't possibly happen and talks tedious drivel about this great ""land of liberty."" (It is a land of liberty, prime minister. And the people of this land of liberty, on their own free will, are very loudly asking to be locked in their own homes. They really are.).And now lockdown is upon us, weeks after other countries, armed with the very same science as us, did the same. (Yes, other countries are in different positions, following different courses. But we are now pursuing a strategy of containing the virus, and there is no point pretending that de-containing it for a couple of weeks has helped. As of now, the consequences of that now aborted strategy look set to be among the most devastating events this country has ever known.)On Saturday afternoon, to give but one example, Essex Country Parks proudly boasted that they had scrapped car parking fees (the right decision, given the potential for queues to use the machines.) They loudly called for people to enjoy a nice, socially distanced walk in the park. On Sunday afternoon, having been unsurprisingly swamped for Mothers' Day, they announced they were shutting all their parks until further notice.Self-isolation... social distancing... these are phrases that meant nothing to anyone two weeks ago. They mean nothing to most people even now. Dig for Victory. Careless Talk Costs Lives. These slogans resonate with people who were born generations after they were ever even used. The coronavirus glossary baffles all who go near it. There is no discernible public information campaign. The advice to stay two metres apart from people has come almost entirely from three lecterns in 10 Downing Street which do not appear to be two metres apart themselves. For the first few of these occasions, the journalists in the room sat shoulder-to-shoulder.It is not yet two weeks since the budget, in which £30bn of public funds were made available for a coronavirus stimulus package. Nine days later, that amount was increased to at least £330bn, the railways are nationalised and the government is paying private sector wages directly. It is hard to say we didn't know we would be here. We chose to be here. Being here was the policy.Impeccably well-connected journalists say that behind the scenes, Boris Johnson has been tremendously effective - leading, delegating, making decisions. I find this very easy to believe. Even Johnson's biggest critics, of whom I must count myself as one, cannot in good faith ignore countless similar reports of the last few months.Both Angela Merkel and Emmanuel Macron have praised his determination and focus, in private meetings, to find a way forward on Brexit. The Irish deputy prime minister, Simon Coveney, who is something of a hero for Remainers, said not that long ago that ""Boris Johnson's visit [to Dublin] was a success."" He added that Johnson had been key to the last-minute breakthrough (and it was a breakthrough.)What has been surprising, over the past nine months and never more so than now, is that Johnson, a performer first and foremost, should have succeeded in private and failed in public.But the public matters. It really matters. Failures are already locked in. Terrible consequences are grimly, horrifically inevitable.It did not need to be this way.",Newspaper; Web Publication
198,"Nudging people to do the right thing works;The suspicion that government has too much faith in behavioural science is wrong - if anything, it's being underused","March 24, 2020 Tuesday",International,thetimes.co.uk,1153,1153,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,Daniel Finkelstein,"Nudging people to do the right thing worksThe suspicion that government has too much faith in behavioural science is wrong - if anything, it's being underused","Earlier this week                    Scientific American                    published an arresting new discovery by a group of social psychologists who had been responsible for a landmark finding in 2012. One that had been cited hundreds of times since it first appeared in a prestigious peer-reviewed journal.Unfortunately, the new discovery was that their original finding had been wrong. The 2012 publication had suggested that if you got people to sign a pledge to tell the truth before filling in a form - tax, say, or insurance - they would be more truthful than if they signed such a declaration at the end. This was plausible and experiments seemed to confirm it.Then an odd thing happened. Governments all over the world tried using the insight and spent a lot of money on it, too. But it didn't work. When the authors returned to their study to figure out why, they realised that with a larger sample and more rigorous methods, the effect of signing an advance pledge disappeared.It's an interesting moment to have recanted. It comes at a time when people are worried that Britain might have delayed reacting to Covid-19 because of meddling behavioural scientists. Voodoo about ""nudges"" and ""compliance fatigue"" may have outweighed the instincts of ""proper"" epidemiologists. The behavioural people may have made Boris Johnson wait instead of acting, advising him that people wouldn't stick a rigorous policy for long, so he shouldn't start too early. And because we paused, people are going to die who needn't have done. These same behavioural insight folk might be involved in the next calculation: when and how do we relax the restrictions? All this as                    Scientific American                    is revealing yet another failure in behavioural science. Can we really rely on these people?The latest revelation of flaws in behavioural science is just that: the latest revelation. Because we already know there are big problems with some of the most famous pieces of behavioural research. The infamous Stanford experiment, say, with the prison guards who turn nasty, or the one with the phoney electric shocks that people are willing to impose are well known, but with the passage of time it's obvious that the methods were flawed and the sample size much too small.So the concern that we have been allowing bogus science to distort what should have been purely medically-driven models is understandable. But it's wrong. If anything, we have been underusing behavioural science, not overusing it. We should be taking it more seriously, not less.The central charge against the behavioural scientists advising the government is untrue. This country has not delayed measures on advice from behavioural scientists that people will get fed up with restrictions and stop complying with them just as we would otherwise reach the peak of contagion.Much of the advice to ministers has been made public. The epidemiological models include many assumptions about how people will behave but they aren't ones that come from behavioural scientists.Some of them are best guesses by epidemiologists and stem from that essential but dangerous thing, common sense. Eventually, common sense tell us, people will get fed up isolating themselves and will stop playing ball (or maybe resume playing ball). This may or may not be reasonable or have led to dangerous delay, but it isn't behavioural science.Apart from anything else, the scientific evidence on compliance fatigue is inconsistent. There have been several studies on compliance that suggest people do indeed flag after a while. In the 2009 hlN1 flu outbreak in Mexico, researchers used TV viewing as a proxy for staying at home. It increased massively and then fell, and the less time spent viewing, the higher the infection rate. However, in the Netherlands the use of preventative measures was sustained, while in China it actually rose with time. As the UCL psychologist Vaughan Bell concludes, the lesson is ""for scientists to be cautious when taking public positions"".Yet there are plenty of behavioural insights that are robust and can help us in lockdown and as we emerge from it. We are using some already. Getting people to sing                    Happy Birthday                    twice as a way of hand washing properly is a classic behavioural intervention. As is getting sanitisers put in prominent positions. But we could be doing more.We should, for example, emphasise the number of people who are complying with restrictions and not the people who aren't. Social media is full of pictures of people who are failing to keep their distance. Yet the more we suggest such dangerous behaviour is common, the more common it will be. The evidence on this is overwhelming. We copy each other. Warning everyone that all their neighbours are stockpiling lavatory paper doesn't make people feel guilty. It makes them go out and buy more lavatory paper.The government and private individuals should be stressing the extraordinary amount of compliance, not the occasional failure. The empty streets, the responsible people exercising far apart from each other, the proportion of us using apps like Zoom. Anything that shows just how successful we are at this distancing malarkey. Everyone else is doing it and if you don't, you are the odd one out. That should be the message.There are other things we know that work. Personalisation, for instance. The behavioural insights team established by David Cameron under David Halpern (who is still advising the government) had success with this, getting people to fill in tax forms and pay fines by using the recipient's name prominently. So if we used emails, texts and other means employing, for instance, the first name of the person receiving it and other details, it would add significantly to the impact of advice coming from conventional media.Steve Martin, a behavioural scientist who with Joe Marks wrote the recent book                    Messengers                   , also questions whether merely using authority figures - the chief medical officer, the prime minister - to deliver the message is enough. There is plenty of research that shows the importance of ""likeness"", that people are influenced by others ""like them"". Yet a proper public awareness campaign using such figures has been notably absent.And most importantly there is a vast literature on how we form new habits, overcome loneliness and ensure we keep a sense of rhythm and purpose. Purpose and being engrossed in what we do is core to being happy. We aren't going to stay locked down for ever. And the chances are that when we are free to go out again, we will still need to keep our behaviour in check.

199,"The PM has succeeded in private, but failed in public","March 24, 2020 Tuesday",International,The Independent (United Kingdom),1528,1528,England & Wales,TOM PECK,"The PM has succeeded in private, but failed in public","At the end of a weekend in which the nation was meant to be on self-enforced coronavirus lockdown, but the parks and streets and markets appeared to look more like the carnival scene in Ferris Bueller's Day Off, it is perhaps worth a quick **record scratch** **freeze frame** to try and work out how we got here.It's not merely that in a pre-recorded statement last night, weighed down with as much personal gravity as the unbearably light prime minister could manage, he enforced a lockdown he has several times ruled out.That is one of the more straightforward aspects of confusion to wrap one's head around. It is harder to understand why it has not happened already.It is very easy to shout abuse at the throngs of people photographed in, say, Victoria Park food market on Sunday lunchtime. We know it's easy because Piers Morgan has done it.It's very easy to either laugh or cry at the vast queues of non-socially distanced shoppers outside your local Asda.But there can be no doubt that people are profoundly confused about what they should and shouldn't and can and cannot do, and there can be no doubt that that is not entirely their fault.Whenever the advice on coronavirus appears to contradict itself, the stock answer, from Boris Johnson or from his leading scientific advisers, is that all that has changed is the speed through which we are moving through the gears of a fixed plan. But even within that context, the information meted out to the British public, who don't all necessarily pay as much attention to what's been said as a political journalist might, has been a truly impenetrable mess.On Sunday evening, Johnson gave a press conference, standing alongside the deputy chief medical officer, Jenny Harries, in which he made it clear that the public would have to stop congregating in public or face new coronavirus enforcement measures.On 10 March, not even two weeks ago, Dr Jenny Harries was interviewed on BBC Breakfast, and when asked why the Cheltenham Festival was ongoing, and the weekend's Premier League football fixtures had not been cancelled, she said the following: ""The virus won't survive very long outside. It will lose its viability to transmit disease, and so many outdoor events particularly are relatively safe.""For many of us watching, that was something of a seismic intervention. The nation does not need armchair epidemiologists, and for those of us who had been tentatively wondering whether it was not slightly mad that millions of people were about to start cramming into giant stadiums all weekend, this provided reassurance. Two days later, the Premier League announced that a full weekend's football fixtures would go ahead. Had the Arsenal manager, Mikel Arteta, and the Chelsea player, Calum Hudson-Odoi, not tested positive for coronavirus, it is more than reasonable to imagine thosematches would have continued as usual.Now we are meant to accept -indeed we must accept -that the Victoria Park food market poses a mortal threat, when not a fortnight ago, when France, Italy, Spain, Belgium and much of the USwere bringing in the kind of shutdown that is now a certainty here, we were publicly reassured that football matches were fine.The weekend's devastating write-ups of the last 10days, principally in The Sunday Times, suggest that even the government's panel of scientific advisers were divided on the correct way forward, which certainly goes some way to explaining why the public seem so unable to find consensus themselves about what they are meant to be doing.On Friday 13March, Sir Patrick Vallance told Sky News that ""herd immunity"" would be required to beat coronavirus, which would involve 60 per cent of the population becoming infected. Professor David Halpern, the head of the Behavioural Insights Team, better known as the nudge unit, used the term in a television interview.Two days later, the health secretary Matt Hancock would write in The Daily Telegraph: ""We have a plan, based on the expertise of world-leading scientists. Herd immunity is not a part of it. That is a scientific concept, not a goal or a strategy.""We now know that the approach changed after the terrifying findings by the Imperial College scientists, that the plan risked 250,000 deaths. I say ""we"". Many people don't know. Many people don't follow it that closely. They don't have a clue what's going on, and no small factor in that is the government saying something is ""not part"" of the plan, when what they mean is that it's not part of the plan anymore.The role of the prime minister in all of this is nothing short of stunning. Can it really be barely a fortnight since he appeared on live television, bragging about going on a hospital visit and shaking hands with coronavirus patients, and then had his spinners quietly seek to correct the record?That one's own eyes and ears are no longer meant to be believed?On Friday evening, asked whether he would see his mother on Mother's Day, he told the nation, ""I hope I'll get to see her."" On Saturday night, after 10pm, a further statement was issued, urging the country to ""do the right thing"" and not see mum this Mother's Day. Even for those half-paying attention, this news will not have arrived until Mother's Day itself, which is a touch late to change one's plans.The panic-buyers are mocked, even though they have been given every reason to panic. News of quarantining the over-70s for four months appears late on a Saturday night on Robert Peston's blog, and a week later, it doesn't appear to be happening at all.(Various doctors still insist to me that this plan is by far the most sensible. A forcible lockdown for those vulnerable, and an attempt to achieve some sort of herd immunity among the rest. Though we trust the experts, even though they don't appear to trust one another, it is not being pursued.)London is going to be locked down, say the newspapers. Then Boris Johnson says it can't possibly happen and talks tedious drivel about this great ""land of liberty"". (It is a land of liberty, prime minister. And the people of this land of liberty, on their own free will, are very loudly asking to be locked in their own homes. They really are.).And now lockdown is upon us, weeks after other countries, armed with the very same science as us, did the same. (Yes, other countries are in different positions, following different courses. But we are now pursuing a strategy of containing the virus, and there is no point pretending that de-containing it for a couple of weeks hashelped. As of now, the consequences of that now aborted strategy look set to be among the most devastating events this country has ever known). On Saturday afternoon, to give but one example, Essex Country Parks proudly boasted that they had scrapped car parking fees (the right decision, given the potential for queues to use the machines.) They loudly called for people to enjoy a nice, socially distanced walk in the park. On Sunday afternoon, having been unsurprisingly swamped for Mothers' Day, they announced they were shutting all their parks until further notice.Self-isolation... social distancing... these are phrasesthat meant nothing to anyone two weeks ago. They mean nothing to most people even now. Dig for Victory. Careless Talk Costs Lives. These slogans resonate with people who were born generations after they were ever even used. The coronavirus glossary baffles all who go near it. There is no discernible public information campaign. The advice to stay two metres apart from people has come almost entirely from three lecterns in 10 Downing Street which do not appear to be two metres apart themselves. For the first few of these occasions, the journalists in the room sat shoulder-to-shoulder.It is not yet two weeks since the budget, in which £30bn of public funds were made available for a coronavirus stimulus package. Nine days later, that amount was increased to at least £330bn, the railways are nationalised and the government is paying private sector wages directly.It is hard to say we didn't know we would be here. We chose to be here. Being here was the policy.Impeccably well-connected journalists say that behind the scenes, Boris Johnson has been tremendously effective -leading, delegating, making decisions. I find this very easy to believe. Even Johnson's biggest critics, of whom I must count myself as one, cannot in good faith ignore countless similar reports of the last few months.Both Angela Merkel and Emmanuel Macron have praised his determination and focus, in private meetings, to find a way forward on Brexit. The Irish deputy prime minister, Simon Coveney, who is something of a hero forRemainers, said not that long ago that ""Boris Johnson's visit [to Dublin] was a success."" He added that Johnson had been key to the last-minute breakthrough (and it was a breakthrough).What has been surprising, over the past nine months and never more so than now, is that Johnson, a performer first and foremost, should have succeeded in private and failed in public.But the public matters. It really matters. Failures are already locked in. Terrible consequences are grimly, horrificallyinevitable.It did not need to be this way.",Newspaper
200,"Don't just blame the public over social distancing. Look to the government;In the Covid-19 crisis, individuals must act responsibly. But weak and complacent messaging has had predictable results Coronavirus - latest updatesSee all our coronavirus coverage","March 24, 2020 Tuesday",International,The Guardian (London),847,847,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,Frances Ryan,"Don't just blame the public over social distancing. Look to the governmentIn the Covid-19 crisis, individuals must act responsibly. But weak and complacent messaging has had predictable results Coronavirus - latest updatesSee all our coronavirus coverage","Backed into a corner, Boris Johnson has announced an unprecedented lockdown on Britain's public life. The solemn tone of last night's address carried the heavy weight of reluctance. For days, the government's messaging has been that the public were failing to practice social distancing of their own accord, with sources saying there was ""            total fury "" across Westminster over people flouting orders and Matt Hancock, the health secretary, accusing those still gathering of being ""            very selfish "".You don't have to be too cynical to feel that this language sounds a lot like the government preparing to play its get out of jail card, whereby it offers vague and unenforceable ""advice"", points disapprovingly to those ignoring it, and is then free to shift blame for the inevitable rise in coronavirus cases on to the public.From the beginning, the government's communications strategy has bordered on lethal complacency. It told the public its plan was "" herd immunity "", which required many to catch the virus, only to backtrack as if it had never said it. Johnson only            closed           pubs and restaurants at the weekend, having previously offered social distancing guidance that never cut through. Until Tuesday's address, ministers have used            paywalled articles and a 5pm briefing to get information across, rather than the blanket national TV ads and billboards you would expect. It has even emerged that the government            can't send advice on coronavirus directly to Britons' mobile phones because it repeatedly ignored its own findings that an emergency messaging system could help in times of crisis. Instead, it had to            rely on mobile network operators.The result has been all too predictable. People in the UK have flocked to seaside towns and            beauty spots in recent days as many families appeared to view schools closing as an opportunity for an early Easter holiday. Parks were filled with groups of friends obliviously meeting up in the sunshine. New data confirms the UK has been            lagging behind other countries in measures such as cutting down our restaurant visits and working at home.The social distancing shambles has led to some uncomfortable ""punching down"", such as high-profile online accounts mocking people for queuing at supermarkets. But a focus on blaming the public risks letting the government - the party with power, resources and reach - off the hook. There is a middle ground, however. It is possible to think adults have a personal responsibility to consider their high-risk neighbours while believing the government has heavily influenced their failure to do so by poor communication and slow action.The theme of personal responsibility often becomes toxic when used politically - whether it's claiming that ""the poor wouldn't need food banks if only they budgeted properly"", or ""the long-term sick would get off benefits if they had enough motivation"". But you don't have to be a libertarian to understand that individual behaviour is key in a pandemic, or to believe that we have a duty to think of each other. While political structures strongly determine our choices, free will still means we hold some responsibility for them. To put it another way: leisure venues being open for so long in the UK was a psychological nudge that gave many people ""permission"" to still use them - but it was still up to each of us if we chose a fun outing with mates over listening to calls to protect someone else's life. An 18-year-old with underlying health problems died this weekend. I wonder how many nights out at the pub they'll miss out on.Public behaviour in the light of Johnson's hands-off approach could be compared to smoking, in that smokers were well aware of the risk of cancer but it took legislative action to discourage many of them. But it's actually more like passive smoking: continuing to socialise in the face of coronavirus, and the state refusing to strongly step in, didn't just endanger individuals themselves, but other people at higher risk. Perhaps instead of photos of damaged lungs on fag packets, the government should be running ads of grandmas in ICU gasping for air. If this is hard to hear, it should be. People are dying. People are trapped inside their homes afraid. Others have enjoyed a day trip to the beach.For years, Britain's political culture has stoked a dog-eat-dog individualism, just as it has cast doubt on experts. We should not be shocked that those particular chickens are now coming home to roost. The government is finally introducing the state-led intervention this pandemic requires. But in the coming weeks values, as well as the law, are going to be what helps us get through this. A recognition that we are all more interconnected than appeared to be case. That individual want doesn't trump community need. That disabled and older people's lives are worth protecting. Some things should not need legislation.

One that had been cited hundreds of times since it first appeared in a prestigious peer-reviewed journal.Unfortunately, the new discovery was that their original finding had been wrong. The 2012 publication had suggested that if you got people to sign a pledge to tell the truth before filling in a form - tax, say, or insurance - they would be more truthful than if they signed such a declaration at the end. This was plausible and experiments seemed to confirm it.Then an odd thing happened. Governments all over the world tried using the insight and spent a lot of money on it, too. But it didn't work. When the authors returned to their study to figure out why, they realised that with a larger sample and more rigorous methods, the effect of signing an advance pledge disappeared.It's an interesting moment to have recanted. It comes at a time when people are worried that Britain might have delayed reacting to Covid-19 because of meddling behavioural scientists. Voodoo about ""nudges"" and ""compliance fatigue"" may have outweighed the instincts of ""proper"" epidemiologists. The behavioural people may have made Boris Johnson wait instead of acting, advising him that people wouldn't stick a rigorous policy for long, so he shouldn't start too early. And because we paused, people are going to die who needn't have done. These same behavioural insight folk might be involved in the next calculation: when and how do we relax the restrictions? All this as Scientific American is revealing yet another failure in behavioural science. Can we really rely on these people? The latest revelation of flaws in behavioural science is just that: the latest revelation. Because we already know there are big problems with some of the most famous pieces of behavioural research. The infamous Stanford experiment, say, with the prison guards who turn nasty, or the one with the phoney electric shocks that people are willing to impose are well known, but with the passage of time it's obvious that the methods were flawed and the sample size much too small.So the concern that we have been allowing bogus science to distort what should have been purely medically-driven models is understandable. But it's wrong. If anything, we have been underusing behavioural science, not overusing it. We should be taking it more seriously, not less.The central charge against the behavioural scientists advising the government is untrue. This country has not delayed measures on advice from behavioural scientists that people will get fed up with restrictions and stop complying with them just as we would otherwise reach the peak of contagion.Much of the advice to ministers has been made public. The epidemiological models include many assumptions about how people will behave but they aren't ones that come from behavioural scientists.Some of them are best guesses by epidemiologists and stem from that essential but dangerous thing, common sense. Eventually, common sense tell us, people will get fed up isolating themselves and will stop playing ball (or maybe resume playing ball). This may or may not be reasonable or have led to dangerous delay, but it isn't behavioural science.Apart from anything else, the scientific evidence on compliance fatigue is inconsistent. There have been several studies on compliance that suggest people do indeed flag after a while. In the 2009 H1N1 flu outbreak in Mexico, researchers used TV viewing as a proxy for staying at home. It increased massively and then fell, and the less time spent viewing, the higher the infection rate. However, in the Netherlands the use of preventative measures was sustained, while in China it actually rose with time. As the UCL psychologist Vaughan Bell concludes, the lesson is ""for scientists to be cautious when taking public positions"".Yet there are plenty of behavioural insights that are robust and can help us in lockdown and as we emerge from it. We are using some already. Getting people to sing Happy Birthday twice as a way of hand washing properly is a classic behavioural intervention. As is getting sanitisers put in prominent positions. But we could be doing more.We should, for example, emphasise the number of people who are complying with restrictions and not the people who aren't. Social media is full of pictures of people who are failing to keep their distance. Yet the more we suggest such dangerous behaviour is common, the more common it will be. The evidence on this is overwhelming. We copy each other. Warning everyone that all their neighbours are stockpiling lavatory paper doesn't make people feel guilty.

It isn't;Dominic Cummings loves to theorise about complexity, but he's getting it all wrong Coronavirus - latest updatesSee all our coronavirus coverage","March 25, 2020 Wednesday",International,The Guardian (London),858,858,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,Nassim Nicholas Taleb and Yaneer Bar-Yam,"The UK's coronavirus policy may sound scientific. It isn'tDominic Cummings loves to theorise about complexity, but he's getting it all wrong Coronavirus - latest updatesSee all our coronavirus coverage","When, along with applied systems scientist Dr Joe Norman, we first reacted to coronavirus on 25 January with the publication of an academic note urging caution, the virus had reportedly infected fewer than 2,000 people worldwide and fewer than 60 people were dead. That number need not have been so high.At the time of writing, the numbers are 351,000 and 15,000 respectively. Our research did not use any complicated model with a vast number of variables, no more than someone watching an avalanche heading in their direction calls for complicated statistical models to see if they need to get out of the way.We called for a simple exercise of the precautionary principle in a domain where it mattered: interconnected complex systems have some attributes that allow some things to cascade out of control, delivering extreme outcomes. Enact robust measures that would have been, at the time, of small cost: constrain mobility. Immediately. Later, we invoked a rapid investment in preparedness: tests, hospital capacity, means to treat patients. Just in case, you know. Things can happen.The error in the UK is on two levels. Modelling and policymaking.First, at the modelling level, the government relied at all stages on epidemiological models that were designed to show us roughly what happens when a preselected set of actions are made, and not what we should make happen, and how.The modellers use hypotheses/assumptions, which they then feed into models, and use to draw conclusions and make policy recommendations. Critically, they do not produce an error rate. What if these assumptions are wrong? Have they been tested? The answer is often no. For academic papers, this is fine. Flawed theories can provoke discussion. Risk management - like wisdom - requires robustness in models.But if we base our pandemic response plans on flawed academic models, people die. And they will. This was the case with the disastrous "" herd immunity "" thesis. The idea behind herd immunity was that the outbreak would stop if enough people got sick and gained immunity. Once a critical mass of young people gained immunity, so the epidemiological modellers told us, vulnerable populations (old and sick people) would be protected. Of course, this idea was nothing more than a dressed-up version of the ""just do nothing"" approach. Individuals and scientists around the world immediately            pointed out the obvious flaws : there's no way to ensure only young people get infected; you need 60-70% of the population to be infected and recover to have a shot at herd immunity, and there aren't that many young and healthy people in the UK, or anywhere. Moreover, many            young people have severe cases of the disease, overloading healthcare systems, and a not-so-small number of them die. It is not a free ride. This doesn't even include the possibility, already suspected in some cases, of            re           ccurrence of the disease. Immunity may not even be reliable for this virus.Worse, it did not take into account that the duration of hospitalisation can be lengthier than they think, or that one can incur a shortage of hospital beds.Second, but more grave, is the policymaking. No 10 appears to be enamoured with ""scientism"" - things that have the cosmetic attributes of science but without its rigour. This manifests itself in the nudge group that engages in experimenting with UK citizens or applying methods from behavioural economics that fail to work outside the university - yet patronise citizens as an insult to their ancestral wisdom and risk-perception apparatus. Social science is in a ""replication crisis"", where less than half the results replicate (under exact same conditions), less than a tenth can be taken seriously, and less than a hundredth translate into the real world.So what is called ""evidence-based"" methods have a dire track record and are pretty much evidence-free. This scientism also manifests itself in Boris Johnson's chief adviser Dominic Cummings's love of complexity and complex systems (our speciality) which he appears to apply incorrectly. And letting a segment of the population die for the sake of the economy is a false dichotomy - aside from the moral repugnance of the idea.As we said, when one deals with deep uncertainty, both governance and precaution require us to hedge for the worst. While risk-taking is a business that is left to individuals, collective safety and systemic risk are the business of the state. Failing that mandate of prudence by gambling with the lives of citizens is a professional wrongdoing that extends beyond academic mistake; it is a violation of the ethics of governing.The obvious policy left now is a lockdown, with overactive testing and contact tracing: follow the evidence from China and South Korea rather than thousands of error-prone computer codes. So we have wasted weeks, and ones that matter with a multiplicative threat.

212,Mass testing is the only way to stop the virus - it's long overdue;The 15-minute coronavirus tests may provide a semblance of normality as UK regions track the spread of coronavirus Anthony Costello is a former director of maternal and child health at the World Health OrganizationCoronavirus - latest updatesSee all our coronavirus coverage,"March 25, 2020 Wednesday",International,The Guardian (London),991,991,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,Anthony Costello,Mass testing is the only way to stop the virus - it's long overdueThe 15-minute coronavirus tests may provide a semblance of normality as UK regions track the spread of coronavirus Anthony Costello is a former director of maternal and child health at the World Health OrganizationCoronavirus - latest updatesSee all our coronavirus coverage,"Since the start of the coronavirus pandemic, the World Health Organization (WHO) has emphasised the crucial importance of testing. Speed is of the essence, and three things are crucial: tracking down cases with symptoms; identifying their household cluster and tracing people they've contacted; and quarantining them until they are no longer infectious. Testing is the basis of public health detective work to shut down an epidemic. ""You can't fight a virus if you don't know where it is,"" said the WHO director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus , recently. "" Find, isolate, test and treat every case, to break the chains of transmission. Every case we find and treat limits the expansion of the disease.""Physical distancing is another strategy, but it's less effective than testing. In the early stages of an epidemic, when clusters are few and far between, one needs a huge population distancing effort to stop their spread. At that point, most people won't grasp the scale of the threat and will resist restrictive orders. So testing, contact tracing and quarantining people with symptoms is crucial. As the epidemic becomes rampant, as in London, the policy must switch to intensive testing to protect health workers.As with other coronavirus outbreaks in Europe, the UK's epidemic has progressed at different speeds across different regions. On Sunday, Dr KK Cheng, the director of the University of Birmingham's Institute of Applied Health Research, reported that 50 local authorities had           10 or           fewer reported coronavirus cases. Rather than adopting a one-size-fits-all national policy, we need to devolve power to our local authorities and their public health outbreak teams. As Dr Cheng pointed out, ""It isn't rocket science. [Testing] does not even require personal protective equipment. Retired GPs, junior medical and nursing students will be delighted to contribute. Case numbers are doubling every four days. Every minute counts now.""Large-scale testing is about more than identifying and isolating cases. Information about the virus is power. Testing can help protect health workers and measure the progression of an epidemic. It can also provide evidence about regional variation and how the virus affects people of            different ages and genders. Virologists can use information about cases to monitor the nature of the virus and any mutations. And data can show social and behavioural scientists whether their physical-distancing measures are working.Testing for the virus across the general population, in other words, can tell us whether our assumptions about coronavirus are correct. A new model from Prof Sunetra Gupta and a team of researchers at Oxford University, published yesterday, reaches conclusions that are very different from the            Imperial College models. Crucially, the Oxford model is not peer reviewed - so we can't be assured that its findings are correct - but Gupta suggests that ""only a very small proportion of the population is at risk of hospitalisable illness"" and that more than half the population have already been exposed to the virus, largely without symptoms. If this were true, we could expect a big surge of hospitalisations and deaths over the next six weeks, but then the epidemic would recede, probably with no second wave. But to know whether this is actually the case, we urgently need immunity tests that will show whether people have had the virus.By 10 March, the rates of reported Covid-19 virus tests were one for every 243 people in South Korea, 995 in Italy, 2,585 in the UK, and 38,695 in the USA. On 12 March, the UK government announced it would stop all community virus detection tests, and focus just on health worker protection. By 16 March, when it realised the NHS faced a potential meltdown if the epidemic went unchecked, the government reversed its policy; rather than mitigating the virus, it returned to a strategy of suppression.Public Health England is now reportedly increasing national laboratory testing capacity in Milton Keynes, but up until now the UK has still only been testing 5,000 specimens per day. In contrast, the Irish government has set up 41 mobile test centres which are processing 100,000 samples per week for a population of 4.9 million (the UK's population is an estimated 66.4 million).Every UK medical school and most large hospitals have labs with polymerase chain reaction (PCR) machines. These can amplify tiny genetic pieces of the virus from nasal swabs to indicate a positive test. Batches of 200 tests can be completed in a few hours. We don't yet have commercially standardised ""primers"" (tools used to find the viral genetic pieces) but, with authorisation from government, labs could develop their own to provide an adequate service for now. If power is devolved to local labs, our local authority outbreak teams could rapidly escalate testing.The announcement of mass home testing in the UK is welcome. Around the world, companies are working frantically to develop diagnostic machines where people swabbing themselves can post samples to a lab. Others are using the Crispr-Cas9 genome editor to create a simple colour change on a test strip within 30 minutes. Either would be a game changer if they could be adopted at scale. People with symptoms would be able to self-isolate, identify contacts, report online to a national database, and the problem of mapping and rapidly quarantining those with coronavirus would be largely solved.Sadly, home testing won't prevent the deluge of cases facing the NHS in the next few weeks. But if the Imperial modellers are right and the epidemic returns after we achieve suppression, local authorities, using evidence from tests, could better control outbreaks and loosen the restrictions on our economy and our lives.

213,Electric cars can transport Britain to a greener future,"March 25, 2020 Wednesday",International,City A.M.,583,583,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,Francesca Lavey,Electric cars can transport Britain to a greener future,"AS THE UK lockdown begins, now is a chance to pause, to take a step back, and consider how our world moves forward when the Covid-19 crisis is over. Right now, we are all staying at home, but when we can travel once again, what does the future of transportation look like? Britain is still very much a nation wedded to our cars. And it's not just long trips: 60 per cent of car journeys are for less than six miles. In London, Transport for London (TfL) wants people to replace these car journeys with more active travel alternatives like cycling and walking, while the Department for Transport has been exploring the feasibility of safely deploying cleaner micromobility options like e-scooters by conducting trials in Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park. But the car remains the travel mode of choice for many.That means that the electrification of road travel is crucial if we're going to keep people and goods moving around our cities while protecting air quality.Myths about electric vehicles (EVs) abound. People underestimate their range, overestimate how expensive they are, and worry about how safe they are to drive. We hosted the launch of BP's On the Move report last year, which found that the big barriers in the public's mind were the cost of vehicles (47 per cent), the availability of charging points (40 per cent), anxiety around battery life (39 per cent), and how long vehicles take to charge (37 per cent).Both the government and industry have a role to play here in educating people about EVs, addressing these concerns and allowing people to test vehicles to help them feel more comfortable. An EV communications vacuum is the perfect breeding ground for misinformation and fear, so industry and government must get on the front foot.The need for a people-centric approach was backed up by a roundtable we hosted, which brought together automotive leaders, representatives from charities, and a major airport. The consensus was that carrots such as financial incentives can be hugely effective, and we need more of them - combined with insights from behavioural economics and a sound understanding of how different segments of society have different desires and wants. For example, people with disabilities often rely on their cars, but research by TfL has found that blue badge holders have concerns about the reliability of EV and are typically more risk-averse. Any attempt to change lifestyles must take these nuances into account.Finally, we need to motivate people to change behaviour, if they're able to. The same BP study found, that despite acknowledging climate change as a problem, only 25 per cent of the people surveyed think it's possible that they'll use greener transport for some of their journeys in the next 10 years. We need a collective mindset change.With the Covid-19 crisis escalating day by day, we're seeing how quickly industry is able to transform and collaborate, and how radically people can change their behaviour.Wouldn't it be great if, when this crisis is over, we could put some of that energy into responding to the climate emergency by bringing about a cleaner mobility future? This is an extremely difficult time for everyone in the country, but let's not take our eye off the other threat to our safety or underestimate the role our transport system can play.£ Francesca Lavey is programme director (mobility) at PlexalWouldn't it be great if, when this crisis is over, we could put some of that energy into responding to the climate emergency",Newspaper
214,Half-hearted early measures could mean lockdown remains until the end of May;Commentary,"March 25, 2020 Wednesday",International,The Daily Telegraph (London),1018,1018,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,Sarah Knapton,Half-hearted early measures could mean lockdown remains until the end of MayCommentary,"On Monday night, Boris Johnson took the unprecedented step of curtailing individual freedoms to prevent the further spread of coroit navirus. He said the measures would be in place for three weeks - until April 13 - and then reviewed.But, given the expected trajectory of the disease, and the decisions taken by other countries who are ahead of Britain in terms of virus progression, it is unlikely they will be lifted then.For a start, compared to most countries, the UK had a porous and half-hearted beginning to its isolation measures, with seemingly few people choosing to stay inside. Less than 12 hours after the Prime Minister's historic address to the nation, the London Underground was jammed with workers, while builders were seen eating together in communal canteens, making a mockery of the rule that no more than two people can gather together in public.Prof Susan Michie, the director of UCL Centre for Behaviour Change, warned that some people would simply not be able to carry out the measures, even if they wanted to.""Five million self-employed people are being left potentially destitute by the Government failing to offer financial support as they have done for directly employed workers,"" she said.""Since £94 is not enough to pay rent, bills, food for a family etc, they will be forced to carry on as usual.""The British Transport Police will be on hand to make sure only critical workers use the Tube. But such an inauspicious start suggests the virus will be spreading further than it would have, had stricter lockdown measures been implemented earlier. And it means the measures we do have are likely to be in place for longer to ""flatten the curve"" in a way that would prevent a second dangerous peak.Yesterday, China announced it would be ending lockdown in Wuhan on April 8, a huge milestone for the country, and a signal that the crisis - for them at least - is nearing its end.Yet that has taken more than two months of extremely draconian restrictions, including travel bans and quarantine zones, to achieve such a level of containment. Britain is nowhere near that level of lockdown.The Chinese restrictions were not lifted for more than 12 weeks after the first death, so if Britain follows a similar path, ours may need to be in place until the end of May/early June. That is when the Government has said expects cases to peak and then level. However, from papers released last week, we know the Government is at least considering restricting movement for the rest of the year.The Scientific Pandemic Influenza Group on Modelling, which feeds into The Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), proposed that because of the length of the outbreak, parts of the country could be placed in six-month lockdowns at a time, before being allowed more freedom.Prof Rowland Kao, a professor of veterinary epidemiology and data science at the University of Edinburgh, said: ""It must be hoped that such measures will only last a relatively short time. However, we must be prepared for this not to be the case, and for them to be in place for an extended period.""The next three weeks until the Prime Minister's review will be crucial, as the unfolding epidemic will now be seen in real time, rather than through modelling, allowing experts to make more accurate predictions of when it will peak, and finally die away.It is also possible that after three weeks it becomes apparent that the costs to shutting down society far outweigh the benefit of slowing the spread and the Government may choose to lift restrictions even before the peak.Mark Woolhouse, professor of infectious disease epidemiology at the University of Edinburgh, said: ""We now enter a phase of careful monitoring. We are looking for indicators first that the epidemic is slowing down and then for numbers of new cases to start to fall. After three weeks we will have to decide whether the restrictions need to be continued, can be relaxed, or can be relaxed temporarily with the expectation of imposing them again later.""We must also monitor the damage that the lockdown is doing; damage to the economy, to education, to psychological well-being and to health and social care provision in the community. The impacts of this epidemic are too far reaching for policy decisions to be driven by epidemiology alone.""There are also hints that countries in Europe may be on a slightly faster course than China.While cases in China peaked some 72 days after the first recorded infections, public health officials in both Germany and Italy believe they are starting to see a plateauing now, which could mean a peak of around 57 and 53 days respectively.Earlier this week Mr Johnson said we were two weeks behind Italy, so Britain may end up peaking by the beginning of April. China left lockdown restrictions in place for nearly a month after the peak, so it is possible restrictions could be lifted early in May. Some experts are still concerned the current restrictions do not go far enough, while others say the Government has been hit by an 'epidemic of action', and is now bringing in measures that have little rationale.However, Dr Andrea Collins, senior clinical lecturer in respiratory medicine at the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine, said: ""I believe that they have not quite gone far enough. We need permits across controlled areas to go to a workplace.""Recent modelling from the Universities of Exeter, Bristol and Warwick suggested that without any measures at all, the epidemic would have peaked around 133 days after first person-to-person transmission in the UK, which happened around Feb 29.So the lockdown has the potential of curtailing the spread by around seven weeks. A welcome relief for people who could have been facing lockdown for most of the summer.It is also possible that the warmer weather in the coming months will stop the virus from replicating, ending our epidemic far sooner than it would have had it played out in the winter months. If so, restrictions will be lifted earlier.'The impacts of this epidemic are too far reaching for policy decisions to be driven by epidemiology alone'",Newspaper

Under the scheme, announced on Tuesday, volunteers will offer help to 1.5 million vulnerable people with underlying health conditions who are most at risk from the coronavirus.""It helps you to feel like you can do something positive, because you feel overwhelmed,"" Hinchliffe said. ""There's so many sad stories, so you want to do what you can to relieve the burden on the NHS. I'm willing to do anything that's required.""Applicants have not yet been told if they have been accepted or what they will be doing. Jobs will include delivering medicines from pharmacies, driving patients to GP appointments or hospital, and making regular phone calls to check on people at risk of loneliness.Jack Hattersley, 22, from Langley Park in Durham, said he saw no reason why he shouldn't volunteer. ""People need help - that's really the crux of it,"" he said. ""Both my parents are key workers - Mum works at a primary school and Dad is a transport manager for Asda. They're doing their thing and I don't see why I shouldn't.""With all three of us out and about it is only a matter of time before one of us gets it and then we'll all have to self-isolate. So I have to help as much as possible while I can.""Hattersley, a student at the University of Kent, was waiting to be verified; it was likely to be up to 72 hours before he heard back. ""I signed up as a community response volunteer and NHS transport volunteer. The north-east will most likely be one of the worst-hit areas in the UK. The poorly funded area and lack of transport there means the only way of overcoming the virus is if we all band together,"" he said.Hattersley and his family have been taking precautions at home. ""We have developed a system of taking off clothes, immediately putting them in the wash and having a shower when we get home.""He added: ""I don't have any concerns at all. It's the lack of equipment that will be the biggest worry to me and other volunteers. My only issue is accidentally passing it on to others."" The scheme will match up volunteers with local healthcare professionals when they need assistance. This sense of community, and the ability to help those nearby, has been a pull for many people.""My parents live about an hour and a half away, and a month before the coronavirus outbreak my dad was diagnosed with non-Hodgkin lymphoma, so he suddenly became one of the most vulnerable in the country,"" said Sarah Goodenough, 48, in Suffolk.""They're not on the doorstep, so I feel so helpless. I'm telling my mum to use the volunteers nearby, so I think I need to be giving back and helping someone in my community."" Shamyla, who lives in London and has just turned 18, has decided to volunteer with the NHS now that her A-levels have been cancelled. ""The past few months I've been coming home and revising, and waking up and revising, and that's all gone, so we're left with nothing to do."" she said. ""I used to volunteer at a hospital in London last year, where I helped out with mealtime support workers and helped in the stockrooms every week. Now I want to get involved with visiting people, going out and getting supplies, or having a chat with people who are in self-isolation to make them feel less lonely."" John Berry, 60, who has retired from the army's physical training corps after 35 years of service, said he would like to help in any way possible. ""I've signed up to be a driver, to deliver food or medical supplies and to help those who are vulnerable,"" he said.Berry, who lives in the West Midlands, said it was important to help those who were struggling. ""I was expecting to hear back but I heard that the government has been inundated with volunteers, which is great news as it shows what we can do as a country when we come together.""Guy Champniss, a behavioural scientist, also thought the volunteering scheme could have some psychological benefits for participants. ""It's a time of particularly drastic measures, and it's difficult to accept that the vast majority of what we do for a living suddenly falls away and is completely irrelevant,"" he said.""Lots of people are curious to keep learning and changing careers because we want more meaning. It makes you question how much meaning your work has if you're simply a bystander, which is what most of us have been reduced to.""Even just applying and going through, that action has been positive,"" he added. ""A lot of behavioural science says that first small step is the critical one, so I feel like now I'm facing in the right direction.""",Newspaper
216,"Far from being a health risk, tennis would ensure our lockdown sanity","March 26, 2020 Thursday",International,The Daily Telegraph (London),567,567,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,SIMON BRIGGS,"Far from being a health risk, tennis would ensure our lockdown sanity","Of all the melancholy sights in my shuttered-up town, perhaps the most poignant is the bank of empty tennis courts, soaking up the sunshine amid a starburst of daffodil beds. Yet this is the state of our glamorous summer game: dormant.The Lawn Tennis Association sent out the following advice to clubs this week. ""Following the Prime Minister's announcement on Monday evening, all tennis facilities and courts should be closed, and tennis coaching and activity should be put on hold with immediate effect."" Explaining the ruling, an LTA spokesman pointed out that - unless you are lucky enough to have your own court at home - playing tennis is bound to involve contact with others.Even if two players remain at the baseline - some 80 feet apart - they will still be sharing a can of disease vectors wearing dayglo felt. The saliva of a Covid-19 carrier contains half-a-trillion virus particles per teaspoon. Which means that, somewhere in the world, somebody must already have become infected via the transfer of tiny droplets from the surface of a tennis ball.Put like that, the argument seems strong. But then, you can go for a jog or a bicycle ride with members of your household. Why not exchange forehands and backhands instead? Exercise, in these dark times, is more than just frippery. It is an essential way to strengthen the body and invigorate the mind, helping to stave off the possibility of infection. And here we come to the unique virtues of tennis - the sport that has been shown in multiple studies to deliver unsurpassed health benefits.Take last year's survey of almost 8,600 people for the Copenhagen City Heart Study. It found that a tennis enthusiast, on average, enjoyed 9.7 more years of life expectancy than a sedentary person. Enough, maybe, to write a series of detective novels, become a proficient pianist, or master a new language. Tennis was the outlier, with a large gap opening up to badminton in second place (an extra 6.2 years), followed by soccer (4.7) and cycling (3.7).The miraculous power of tennis is also closely linked to its social dimension - the club spirit, which brings people together at the bar afterwards, and which has surely been responsible for more marriages than any other sport. Evidently, such playfulness is no longer possible in the age of Covid-19.But even if you are self-isolating with your family, isn't it beneficial to break up the routine? Maybe even to express your angst via a few bodyline backhands? From a broader perspective, haven't the Government's own experts expressed their concern over ""behavioural fatigue""? We are talking here about a ritualised duel, a sport sometimes described as ""posh boxing"". As with any form of competition, tennis channels the safe expression of hostility in a controlled environment. As for the practicalities, thousands of clubs around the country are already equipped with key fobs or pin-code keypads (gloves mandatory here please). These enable members to take the court frictionlessly, without risk of contamination.Amid Britain's mass confinement, the responsible use of tennis courts ought to be encouraged rather than forbidden. Instead of lying vacant, those empty courts should be pressed into service for the benefits of our collective sanity. As long, that is, as they are more than two metres apart.follow Simon Briggs on Twitter @simonrbriggs; read more at www.telegraph.co.uk/opinion",Newspaper

Within the health service the response has been equally heartening, with many employees redeployed to cope with the crisis. It is therefore disappointing to see the response of the British Medical Association. It has rightly raised concerns about personal protective equipment but has also discouraged young doctors and medical students from taking up roles within hospital trusts. The BMA has advised medical students to decline voluntary work until a national contract has been agreed with the BMA that covers pay, annual leave, study leave, expenses, pensions and much more. The many NHS staff who have worked selflessly over the past few weeks have done so without any regard for pay, hours of work, pension or leave. I cannot imagine that the public volunteers are considering pension entitlement.When individuals or institutions are faced with a crisis, they often show their true colours. The BMA has shown that it is a self-serving union that puts its own interests above the lives of our patients.                   Professor Martin McNally                    Oxford University Hospitals NHS TrustSir, The president of the British Laryngological Association says that it has not been established why ENT consultants are more prone to getting coronavirus infection (""Fear contagious among staff fighting on NHS front line"", Mar 26). My daughter (a junior doctor) and her partner (a policeman) are self-isolating due to presumed Covid-19 infection and although neither is unwell, both have developed profound anosmia (loss of sense of smell). Her partner has no other symptoms at all.It is clear to me that ENT consultants have been seeing fit young people in outpatient clinics over the past few weeks whose only symptom is acute anosmia, and have been performing close-up examination of the nasal passages to try to determine the cause. In doing so they will inadvertently have exposed themselves to coronavirus.                   Dr Kath Hughes                   GP, Holton, OxonSir, David Aaronovitch (""This is the cost of our hideous complacency"", Mar 26) tells a chilling tale of what might have been if world leaders had heeded experts such as the independent Commission on a Global Health Risk Framework for the Future and the Global Preparedness Monitoring Board, which had predicted a pandemic such as the one we are now experiencing.Countries have been willing to spend eyewatering amounts of money on weapons of mass destruction that can never be used yet these same states have been reluctant to spend what are comparatively small amounts on measures that would save millions of lives around the world.                   Mary Slinger                   Highnam, GlosSir, Earlier this month the government urged people aged over 70 to self-isolate. This I and my husband did, thinking that we could rely on online shopping and delivery for food essentials. However, when I try to log on to Sainsbury's online site, only those people deemed ""extremely vulnerable to coronavirus"" and registered on the gov.uk website are now able to shop online. If other supermarkets take the same position we will be unable to shop online for food. It would seem, then, that the over-70s are now supposed to go out to shop for groceries.                   Helen Ashton                   Saltford, Bristol                   WITHHOLDING PRIVATE SCHOOL FEES                   Sir, As proprietors of some of the country's largest private education groups we want to reassure hard-pressed families that schools are doing what they can to help in the present emergency. Private schools are operating extensive online learning platforms so that children's education will not be interrupted, and the fees parents pay are also helping to support many of the country's key workers, who are vital to our fight against the coronavirus. Despite that, some parents might consider withholding fees if the nature of provision has changed, albeit only in the short term. No school wants to make teachers redundant, recognising that the relationship between teacher and pupil is the most precious commodity; parents will want reassurance that this will still be the case in September. We are happy to give that reassurance while recognising that parents also face unprecedented challenges. Our schools are doing everything possible to support parents financially during the present crisis.

But apart from Sunday services, our small and remote Anglican church regularly receives solitary visits at all times of the day and week for private prayer, contemplation and reassurance.However, our rector has now had to lock the church for the duration of the crisis (letter, Mar 26). This may be the first time that this has happened at this church in several centuries. If the C of E cannot allow its buildings to stay open for parishioners to pray, quietly and alone, in this dreadful time, what is it for? And why should anyone go back there when things have returned to normal?                   Martin Pettinger                   Hassocks, W Sussex                   WALK, DON'T WALK                   Sir, Coronavirus has led to many good decisions made in haste and many poor ones. My local council has veered towards the poor. Hammersmith and Fulham council closed all its parks at the weekend. If you wish to do your daily exercise/walk the dog you now have only pavements to do so, making it impossible to maintain social distancing if someone is coming the other way. As the parks are now closed, invariably someone is approaching. The council has managed to make walking more, rather than less, dangerous. I note that the traffic wardens are still working and giving out tickets. Today on my pavement walk (and hello to all those I passed far too close) I noticed one waiting outside a pharmacy, ready and poised. People who had driven there were presumably trying to avoid the full pavements. It is shameful.                    Edgar Morse                   London SW6Sir, On my daily walk with my wife this morning a man came towards us carrying what looked like walking canes but were held loosely at his side. When we got within a few paces he raised the two-metre sticks horizontally at waist height to keep us at a safe distance.                    Andy Wiggins                   Tenterden, Kent                   OLDER AND WISER                   Sir, Max Hastings's comments sent a chill down my 68-year-old spine (""My oldie generation is privileged and selfish"", Mar 25, and letters, Mar 26). He seems to be endorsing a view that life becomes less valuable with the passage of time, becoming reasonably expendable once an arbitrary number is reached. Not only are the elderly less useful, Hastings feels, but they should feel guilty about it too, especially if they have been lucky enough to have lived through good times. This is virtue signalling, pure and simple.I understand the fine balance between preserving the economy and preventing a mass cull of the older generation. I am glad I still live in a society that holds the Christian belief that all life is equal before God.                   Dr Bob Jones                   Wadworth, DoncasterSir, The over-70s considered ""privileged and selfish"" by Max Hastings have, like every generation before them, desired to see their offspring better off than themselves. To this end, those who could afford it have donated huge sums towards getting their children on to an increasingly expensive property ladder, to such an extent that the Bank of Mum and Dad features in the mortgage tables alongside banks. They have taken responsibility for the care of grandchildren so their parents can work and keep paying those mortgages while enjoying a lifestyle whose expectations would never have been dreamt of in their day.On the thorny question of the costs of care, whose pockets are they considering when trying to preserve savings? Not themselves, because they will be dead when the final financial reckoning comes. They worry about care costs because they want to ""leave something to the family"".                   Jennifer Rees                   Cardiff                   NUDGING BEHAVIOUR                   Sir, As a behavioural scientist I largely agree with Daniel Finkelstein (""Nudging people to do the right thing works"", Mar 25) but there are some basic communication skills that the government has failed to use. Where, for example, are the visual aids? In his address to the nation, instead of talking at us about the need to stay at home, the prime minister could easily have used a simple diagram to show how just one person failing to practise social distancing spreads the virus. I hate to admit it, but we don't need behavioural scientists to remind us that a picture is worth a thousand words.                   Dr Peter Honey                   London SE1                   SUMMER OF SPORT                   Sir, Cancellation of the world's major sporting events and activity because of the pandemic leaves a huge gap in many lives. The solution largely lies in the BBC's hands: it should replay the broadcasts of last year's sports, such as                    Match of the Day                   , on the equivalent day this year. The British summer is not summer without Wimbledon in the afternoons, so the BBC should rerun Wimbledon 2019. As for the lost Tokyo Olympics? What an opportunity to rejoice in the replay of London 2012. What a morale boost that would be.                    Sir John Tusa                   Managing director, BBC World Service 1986-92; London N1                   THE SKY AT NIGHT                   Sir, It is heartening to discover any positive aspects of the pandemic. One such during the past few crystal-clear evenings in this urban part of Norfolk has been the spectacular sight of the International Space Station. I do not recall ever seeing it in such detail, and the number of stars visible in the night sky is a powerful reminder of those star-studded days that we took for granted in my younger days.

To plant seeds in inaccessible places, my grandfather removed the shot from cartridges, replaced it with wild flower seeds and shot at bare earth or cliff faces. Many grew and thrived over the decades.

This does not apply only to old masters. I recently found Wassily Kandinsky's                    Dominant Curve                    in a charity shop. Doing the jigsaw was like being there when he painted it - one could follow every brushstroke.

Mr Johnson, who has a high temperature and persistent cough, said he would still lead the ""national fightback"" against the virus from his flat above Number 11.The 55-year-old noticed that he had mild symptoms on Thursday afternoon and received the test results at midnight, Downing Street said.His pregnant partner Carrie Symonds is not with the PM, and is reportedly isolating alone in Camberwell, south London, with the couple's dog, Dilyn.Mr Johnson and Mr Hancock have been working closely with the country's top medics, including England's chief medical officer Professor Chris Whitty, deputy chief medical officer Dr Jenny Harries and chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance.It is not known which close contacts have been tested, but Downing Street said the advice on social distancing had been observed in Number 10.Sir Patrick tweeted that he has experienced no symptoms and has therefore not been tested.Some scientists were critical of the fact the House of Commons has largely stayed ""open for business"", enabling the virus to spread.Professor Susan Michie, director of the Centre for Behaviour Change at University College London, said: ""Whilst the PM was telling people to stay at home and keep at least two metres apart from each other, the House of Commons was open for business and face-to-face parliamentary activities were carrying on.""Given the transmission routes of touching contaminated surfaces and breathing in virus-laden droplets, it should not come as a surprise to hear that the PM and Health Secretary have tested positive for coronavirus.""There are many reasons why those in leadership positions, including in Government, should practise what they preach."" In a video message posted to Twitter, Mr Johnson said: ""I'm working from home and self-isolating and that's entirely the right thing to do. ""But, be in no doubt that I can continue thanks to the wizardry of modern technology to communicate with all my top team to lead the national fightback against coronavirus.""I want to thank everybody involved and, of course, our amazing NHS staff.""Mr Hancock tweeted: ""Fortunately for me the symptoms so far have been very mild so I've been able to carry on with the work driving forward the UK response."" A spokesman for the Chancellor said Rishi Sunak has not had any symptoms and therefore has not been tested for coronavirus and is not self-isolating.                      Michael Gove, Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, has not been tested for coronavirus as he has not displayed symptoms of the virus, his wife Sarah Vine said on Twitter.

The chief medical officer ,Prof Chris Whitty, also reported symptoms and went into self-isolation.But while Johnson said he would be able to continue to run the government's response to the crisis alone in his Downing Street flat, public health experts rounded on his attitude to the infection and accused him of being ""nonchalant"" and ""slow"" to behave appropriately.The prime minister has previously been accused of failing to keep an appropriate distance from other senior figures in public, and has continued with parliamentary duties this week, raising the possibility that he may have infected others in the cabinet and beyond.On another day of rapid growth in the number of deaths caused by the virus, Johnson issued a video message revealing that he had developed ""mild symptoms"". But he added: ""Be in no doubt that I can continue, thanks to the wizardry of modern technology, to communicate with all my top team to lead the national fightback against coronavirus.""Johnson's chief adviser, Dominic Cummings, was subsequently spotted running out of No 10 and along Downing Street, apparently hoping not to be noticed.Not long afterwards, Hancock issued his own statement saying he too had tested positive, and would be working from home. And later in the day, Prof Whitty, who had advised the prime minister to get tested, said he too was displaying symptoms.The three men leading the UK's response to the pandemic - Johnson, Hancock and Whitty - must now do so from quarantine, as cases continue to surge.The foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, is the designated stand-in for Johnson if the prime minister proves unable to continue with his duties, but that contingency plan has not yet been activated.Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove announced at Friday's Downing Street press conference that another 181 people had now died from the virus, taking the total across the UK to 759.Experts questioned whether Johnson had been shielded from the virus effectively enough, and asked why ministers and other colleagues who have worked closely with him in recent days were not being tested.The deputy chief medical officer, Dr Jenny Harries, said detailed contact-tracing was ""not appropriate"" at this stage of the outbreak, but that the men would have been tested because of their importance to the government's response to the crisis.Johnson's spokesman said: ""No 10 is considered a workplace. The advice to staff here and the prime minister's colleagues is that they don't need to do anything in terms of self-isolation unless they start to suspect that they have symptoms, in which case they should follow the Public Health England advice.""Despite urging the nation in a solemn broadcast on Monday evening to ""stay at home"" where possible, Johnson continued to carry out his parliamentary duties, including prime minister's questions - though the Downing Street press briefings have been carried out by video link since Monday.Prof Susan Michie, director of the centre for behaviour change at University College London, said: ""Those in leadership positions should practise what they preach. If leaders do not adhere to their own recommendations, this undermines trust in them, which in turn can undermine the population's adherence to their advice. The advice was to go to work only if essential or if you could not work from home and could guarantee your own and others' safety by keeping at least two metres apart.""Given the transmission routes, of touching contaminated surfaces and breathing in virus-laden droplets, it should not come as a surprise to hear that the prime minister and health secretary have tested positive.""Dr John Ashton, a former regional director of Public Health England, said: ""The government has been too slow to act on this, and they've been slow as individuals. I was surprised to see prime minister questions going ahead this week - it was clearly unnecessary.""It reinforces the view that lockdown measures taken earlier this week should have been taken sooner, and raises questions about the ability of people in power, including the prime minister, to discipline themselves. They should all have been more careful."" Prof Devi Sridhar, chair of global public health at the University of Edinburgh, said: ""Leaders need to lead by example. It wasn't a good thing that he was telling people that he was going around shaking hands and being quite nonchalant about the virus."" Johnson received the result of his test at midnight, hours after he was seen outside the door of No 10 clapping in support of NHS workers alongside the chancellor, Rishi Sunak.Both Johnson and Hancock have been in repeated contact with other senior political figures, including cabinet members and advisers, in the last few days. But no other ministers would be tested for the virus unless they showed symptoms, Downing Street said.It is unknown how Johnson contracted the illness, but officials confirmed that other people who worked in No 10 were self-isolating after showing symptoms. Johnson's spokesman said: ""From the moment he had symptoms, he took steps to ensure that he wasn't in close contact with anyone.""He did really want to take part in clapping NHS staff. It's something he felt was important, but in taking part in that national moment he ensured he didn't come into close contact with anyone. He stood outside No 10 at a very significant distance from the chancellor.""No 11 Downing Street and its four-bedroom flat- previously occupied by the former prime ministers David Cameron and Tony Blair - have been sealed off from No 10 and No 12 by shutting the doors that staff and government officials usually use to move between the buildings.The prime minister will work from the office usually used by the chancellor, who has given it over to Johnson during his period of isolation. It has been fitted with video-conferencing equipment.During his isolation, Johnson will have meals and work delivered to him by staff, who will knock on the door and then give him time to collect it.The prime minister's spokesman would not comment on whether his partner, Carrie Symonds, who is pregnant, was in Downing Street or would be self-isolating. The recommendation for members of the household of someone who has the virus is to self-isolate for 14 days.",Newspaper

All are continuing to work.Analysis by the PA news agency shows it took 13 days for the number of deaths in the UK to go from one to just above 100.It took a further eight days to reach the latest total of 759.The jump in coronavirus-related deaths in the UK from 578 to 759 is an increase of 181 - the biggest day-on-day rise and a 31% jump on the figures released on Thursday.Hours before Prof Whitty's announcement the Prime Minister and Health Secretary both released video messages on social media announcing that they ""mild symptoms"".Mr Johnson, who has a high temperature and persistent cough, said he would still lead the ""national fightback"" against the virus from his flat above Number 11.The 55-year-old noticed that he had mild symptoms on Thursday afternoon and received the test results at midnight, Downing Street said.His pregnant partner Carrie Symonds is not with the PM, and is reportedly isolating alone in Camberwell, south London, with the couple's dog, Dilyn.Mr Johnson and Mr Hancock have been working closely with the country's top medics, including Prof Chris Whitty, deputy chief medical officer Dr Jenny Harries and chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance.It is not known which close contacts have been tested, but Downing Street said the advice on social distancing had been observed in Number 10.Sir Patrick tweeted that he has experienced no symptoms and has therefore not been tested.Some scientists were critical of the fact the House of Commons has largely stayed ""open for business"", enabling the virus to spread.Professor Susan Michie, director of the Centre for Behaviour Change at University College London, said: ""Whilst the PM was telling people to stay at home and keep at least two metres apart from each other, the House of Commons was open for business and face-to-face parliamentary activities were carrying on.""Given the transmission routes of touching contaminated surfaces and breathing in virus-laden droplets, it should not come as a surprise to hear that the PM and Health Secretary have tested positive for coronavirus.""There are many reasons why those in leadership positions, including in Government, should practise what they preach.""In a video message posted to Twitter, Mr Johnson said: ""I'm working from home and self-isolating and that's entirely the right thing to do.""But, be in no doubt that I can continue thanks to the wizardry of modern technology to communicate with all my top team to lead the national fightback against coronavirus.""I want to thank everybody involved and, of course, our amazing NHS staff.""Mr Hancock tweeted: ""Fortunately for me the symptoms so far have been very mild so I've been able to carry on with the work driving forward the UK response.""A spokesman for the Chancellor said Rishi Sunak has not had any symptoms and therefore has not been tested for coronavirus and is not self-isolating.Michael Gove, Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, has not been tested for coronavirus as he has not displayed symptoms of the virus, his wife Sarah Vine said on Twitter.Meanwhile Radd Seiger, spokesman for the family of teenage motorcyclist Harry Dunn, said Mr Hancock ""irresponsibly failed to socially distance himself"" when they met him on March 18.Mr Seiger claimed the Health Secretary had hugged the family and shaken his hand as they met at the Department for Health and Social Care to discuss the teenager's death.Earlier this week, it was announced that the Prince of Wales was also suffering ""mild symptoms"" of Covid-19.On Thursday night Charles was seen for the first time since testing positive.Clarence House posted a video in its Instagram Stories of heir to the throne Charles joining in with the round of applause for the NHS from Birkhall, his private home on the Balmoral estate in Scotland.",Newspaper
225,Scientists working to steer Britain out of coronavirus crisis targeted with death threats;Members of the public have sent threats to the publicly-funded organisation which advises the government at times of crisis,"March 28, 2020 Saturday",International,telegraph.co.uk,718,718,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,By Katherine Rushton,Scientists working to steer Britain out of coronavirus crisis targeted with death threatsMembers of the public have sent threats to the publicly-funded organisation which advises the government at times of crisis,"The scientists working to steer Britain out of the coronavirus crisis are being targeted with death threats, the Telegraph can disclose.Members of the public have sent threats to experts on the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (SAGE), the publicly-funded organisation which advises the government at times of crisis.A SAGE source said: ""There are already all number of death threats being sent to people involved. In the last few weeks, some of the people who have been involved have received abuse in the street.""Many of the threats are from people furious that the group endorsed a ""herd immunity"" strategy before the lockdown was imposed.""It's a combination [of people who are angry at the lockdown] and also this concept of herd immunity. A lot of people are under the misapprehension that all the scientists want people to die in order to protect the masses,"" the source said.Sir Patrick Vallance, chairman of SAGE and chief scientific advisor, said two weeks ago that 40 million people in the UK could need to catch the coronavirus to build up ""herd immunity"" and prevent the disease returning.At the time, the Government strategy was telling people to self-isolate for seven days if they got the disease, but was not yet advising whole households to stay at home if one member had coronavirus symptoms.Sir Patrick defended the policy - which was based on considerable research-saying that it was designed to slow the spread of the disease but would not stop the virus completely.""What we don't want is everybody to end up getting it in a short period of time so we swamp and overwhelm NHS services-that's the flattening of the peak,"" he said at the time.""Communities will become immune to it and that's going to be an important part of controlling this longer term.""However, Prime Minister Boris Johnson stepped things up after doomsday predictions by mathematical modellers at Imperial College London suggested that coronavirus was about to have a devastating effect on the country. The study - which was also commissioned by SAGE, and led by Professor Neil Ferguson who sits on the SAGE panel - warned that up to 250,000 people could die if the Government did not change course. Mr Johnson - advised by Sir Patrick's committee-subsequently introduced a full lock down. It has been welcomed by many, but has also sparked warnings that the economic damage it will cause could end up costing more lives than will be saved.Other than Sir Patrick, Sage does not publish a list of the advisors who make up its membership - partly for privacy reasons and partly because the attendees change according to the emergency. A source said: ""It's an entire spread of experts from all areas, so you've got epidemiologists, virologists, social behavioural scientists. ""The cast list changes every single meeting depending on what the need is - so there is no one, set rolling cast list.""It needs to be viewed in the same way as people view the Cabinet Office Briefing Rooms, in that at COBR there isn't a list of standardised published names. The level of sensitivity of what is discussed at Sage is lent to what's discussed at Cobra. You're talking about excess deaths and these sorts of things.""The death threats are thought to have been levelled at members of the Scientific Pandemic Influenza Group on Modelling and the Independent Scientific Pandemic Influenza Group on Behaviour - known as SPI-M and SPI-B.Earlier this week, SAGE said in a press release that it has relied very heavily on these two groups - amongst others - to help it formulate its response to the coronavirus.Sir Patrick said at the time: 'The UK is home to experts who are at the forefront of their chosen fields and we are making full use of their expertise to grow our understanding of COVID-19 as we work tirelessly to tackle this disease.'A Government spokesperson said: ""We are concerned by any reports of threats and abuse being made towards scientists who are working tirelessly to provide the Government with the best possible advice.""In these unprecedented times we are more reliant than ever upon the collective expertise of our world-class scientific community. Like NHS workers and our emergency services, they are on the frontline of efforts to slow the spread of COVID-19, protect our health service and save lives.""",Newspaper; Web Publication

Sars-CoV-2, the coronavirus that causes it, is now on the rampage across the globe, partly sustained and amplified by human behaviour at every level.On an individual basis, we continued to commute to work, to socialise in bars and restaurants, and traipse to theatres and museums, even after health experts and politicians, alarmed by the crises unfolding in other countries, asked us not to. Back then, it seemed less disruptive to continue life as we knew it: we discounted the future and hoped the virus would burn itself out before reaching our doorstep.We have run out of doorsteps and the consequences are devastating beyond comprehension. The world changes day by day, hour by hour. On Tuesday, the UK, like so many other countries before it, began life under lockdown.Why did people flout social distancing advice? The coronavirus, suggests Professor Robin Dunbar, an evolutionary psychologist at Oxford university, exploits instinctive behavioural shortcuts long practised by our species. For most of our history, survival depended on being a member of a group. ""We are primates - the whole evolutionary strategy of primates is our intense sociality,"" he told me. ""So, it doesn't surprise me that teens and young people were still rushing out. It takes a very long time, perhaps 25 years, to learn about the implications of your behaviour."" The young might also have felt invincible: hospital statistics suggest that children and young adults are largely unaffected, a morsel of consolation amid the panic.Discounting the future can also be a survival instinct, Dunbar points out. Why worry about what lies over the horizon, our ancestors reasoned, when the only thing that matters is today? If we do not survive today, there can be no tomorrow. Covid-19 has prospered in the wake of these behavioural calculations. We need to rethink how to manage our lives in a world of contagion.When I wrote in early January about a mystery pneumonia from China, never did I foresee it metastasising into the Big One, a pandemic to rival the 1918 Spanish flu.Humans have no immunity to novel viruses; we are all ""immunologically naive"", meaning we can all be infected. That is an unfamiliar situation, particularly for those of us in the global north. Most contagious childhood diseases such as measles have been vaccinated away; seasonal flu vaccines offer protection against an annual foe.It is no longer infectious diseases that dominate the health agenda but noncommunicable diseases like heart disease, type 2 diabetes and cancer. Noncommunicable diseases account for 71 per cent of global deaths annually and demand individual, not collective, choices: should I give up smoking? Should I hit the gym or the doughnuts? The risks and benefits are mine alone.Covid-19 demands a different reckoning: the welfare of the collective versus the cost to the individual. You can be infected and transmit the virus without knowing it. According to the WHO, the case fatality ratio (number of deaths divided by number of reported cases) is about 3-4 per cent, with older people and those with underlying health conditions most vulnerable. Your individual chance of dying might be low but the risk to your contacts might be high. That is why social distancing measures are meant to apply to everyone.The way an infectious disease spreads depends on its ""reproduction number"", known as R. This is the average number of contacts to whom an infectious person transmits the disease. If R is below one, it will peter out; above one means it will spread. For seasonal flu, R is around 1.3. For Covid-19, R hovers somewhere between 2 and 3.That one-digit difference is not mathematically, or epidemiologically, trivial. With an R of 2, the number of people infected at each link in the transmission chain doubles. The fifth generation will comprise 32 new cases. If R is 3, the number of new infections triples rather than doubles at every stage. In this scenario, the fifth generation alone numbers 243 new cases. That is why, across countries, the numbers of Covid-19 cases, when plotted against time, show such a steep rise after a few weeks.Now the good news: R is not set in stone. As British epidemiologist Adam Kucharski explains in The Rules of Contagion, there are four factors that feed into R: the duration for which a person is infectious; the number of spreading opportunities per day during that infectious period; the probability that an opportunity leads to transmission; and the susceptibility of the population. ""Breaking the reproduction number down ... can help us work out the best way to control an epidemic,"" writes Kucharski, a member of a modelling team at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, which is advising the UK government on its Covid-19 response. He calls this the DOTS rule: duration, opportunities, transmission and susceptibility. Some of the dots can be massaged downwards. A vaccine is the best way to cut susceptibility - but none for Covid-19 is likely to exist within a year. Other ways to cut R entail reducing both spreading opportunities and the chances of transmission occurring during those opportunities. Those basic ambitions lie at the heart of the unprecedented social and economic shutdowns. Minimising the frequency and length of social interactions starves the virus of the very thing it needs to propagate: human contact. It also slows the spread, allowing the healthcare burden to be spaced out.Danger may come, however, when restrictions are later lifted, especially if there is no vaccine or treatment. Further waves of infections can hit once people, and viruses, start moving around again; this appears to be happening in Hong Kong.It is possible, though not guaranteed, that survivors of the first Covid-19 wave will be immune if a second pulsates around the globe. With serological testing for Covid-19 antibodies - those who have had the virus will carry these, like biological battle scars - and careful society-wide orchestration, any subsequent attempt at suppressing the virus might need not be so disruptive.But these are just hunches; we are in unknown territory. That makes the Covid-19 emergency the mother of all risk-management problems, according to Gilberto Montibeller, professor of management science at Loughborough University.""The disease transmission models are not enough,"" says Montibeller. ""Epidemiologists have been driving policy, which is great, but we need to know other impacts beyond the number of people infected and the care they need. There is a lot of science, such as risk analysis, that hasn't been included in this debate. We also need more understanding of individual behaviour and group behaviour in a pandemic scenario. It's not just about mitigating risk but managing perceived risk too.""Soliciting these insights, Montibeller suggests, might have anticipated the panic-buying seen in several countries. That reaction was predictable, he says, given that the virus is a perfect toxic storm of the dreadful and the unknown.The behavioural science used to inform the UK government's response - trying to ""nudge"" people into staying at home - was also misjudged. ""Nudging wasn't created for these kinds of health threats and it isn't suitable here. Companies and governments now need to raise the quality of decision-making in this very difficult scenario.""""  In terms of shutting down epidemics, the west must look toeuropen countries, which remembered the lessons from Sars. Hong Kong, Singapore and South Korea saw their commitment to surveillance, testing and contact tracing rewarded with flatter curves and fewer Covid-19 deaths. Restarting their economies may be a smoother task, since people will know, through testing, whether they have had the disease. New, accelerated ways of developing, testing and manufacturing vaccines will also be an urgent priority; the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations, formed in response to the Ebola outbreak, deserves credit for pushing this agenda as an economic imperative.The real and perceived threat of the Covid-19 virus to our future is clearly sky-high. It is an unfamiliar, lethal pathogen with no vaccine, no cure, not even a clear picture as to whether a person can be infected twice. Like all viruses, it mutates as it circulates. It is an invisible enemy in perpetual motion.There are reasons to be optimistic: the race for a vaccine has started, and last week WHO announced a global, nofrills ""mega-trial"" to see if existing drugs could be repurposed to treat Covid-19.But we do not have the upper hand yet. Dr Mike Ryan, who leads WHO's global Covid-19 containment efforts and captained its Ebola response, watched for weeks as Europe, now in the eye of the viral storm, discounted the future and maintained business as usual.At a memorable press conference on March 13, he reminded countries that inertia would be punished.

The young might also have felt invincible: hospital statistics suggest that children and young adults are largely unaffected, a morsel of consolation amid the panic.Discounting the future can also be a survival instinct, Dunbar points out. Why worry about what lies over the horizon, our ancestors reasoned, when the only thing that matters is today? If we do not survive today, there can be no tomorrow. Covid-19 has prospered in the wake of these behavioural calculations. We need to rethink how to manage our lives in a world of contagion.When I wrote in early January about a mystery pneumonia from China, never did I foresee it metastasising into the Big One, a pandemic to rival the 1918 Spanish flu.Humans have no immunity to novel viruses; we are all ""immunologically naive"", meaning we can all be infected. That is an unfamiliar situation, particularly for those of us in the global north. Most contagious childhood diseases such as measles have been vaccinated away; seasonal flu vaccines offer protection against an annual foe.It is no longer infectious diseases that dominate the health agenda but noncommunicable diseases like heart disease, type 2 diabetes and cancer. Noncommunicable diseases account for 71 per cent of global deaths annually and demand individual, not collective, choices: should I give up smoking? Should I hit the gym or the doughnuts? The risks and benefits are mine alone.Covid-19 demands a different reckoning: the welfare of the collective versus the cost to the individual. You can be infected and transmit the virus without knowing it. According to the WHO, the case fatality ratio (number of deaths divided by number of reported cases) is about 3-4 per cent, with older people and those with underlying health conditions most vulnerable. Your individual chance of dying might be low but the risk to your contacts might be high. That is why social distancing measures are meant to apply to everyone.The way an infectious disease spreads depends on its ""reproduction number"", known as R. This is the average number of contacts to whom an infectious person transmits the disease. If R is below one, it will peter out; above one means it will spread. For seasonal flu, R is around 1.3. For Covid-19, R hovers somewhere between 2 and 3.That one-digit difference is not mathematically, or epidemiologically, trivial. With an R of 2, the number of people infected at each link in the transmission chain doubles. The fifth generation will comprise 32 new cases. If R is 3, the number of new infections triples rather than doubles at every stage. In this scenario, the fifth generation alone numbers 243 new cases. That is why, across countries, the numbers of Covid-19 cases, when plotted against time, show such a steep rise after a few weeks.Now the good news: R is not set in stone. As British epidemiologist Adam Kucharski explains in The Rules of Contagion, there are four factors that feed into R: the duration for which a person is infectious; the number of spreading opportunities per day during that infectious period; the probability that an opportunity leads to transmission; and the susceptibility of the population. ""Breaking the reproduction number down ... can help us work out the best way to control an epidemic,"" writes Kucharski, a member of a modelling team at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, which is advising the UK government on its Covid-19 response. He calls this the DOTS rule: duration, opportunities, transmission and susceptibility. Some of the dots can be massaged downwards. A vaccine is the best way to cut susceptibility - but none for Covid-19 is likely to exist within a year. Other ways to cut R entail reducing both spreading opportunities and the chances of transmission occurring during those opportunities. Those basic ambitions lie at the heart of the unprecedented social and economic shutdowns. Minimising the frequency and length of social interactions starves the virus of the very thing it needs to propagate: human contact. It also slows the spread, allowing the healthcare burden to be spaced out.Danger may come, however, when restrictions are later lifted, especially if there is no vaccine or treatment. Further waves of infections can hit once people, and viruses, start moving around again; this appears to be happening in Hong Kong.It is possible, though not guaranteed, that survivors of the first Covid-19 wave will be immune if a second pulsates around the globe. With serological testing for Covid-19 antibodies - those who have had the virus will carry these, like biological battle scars - and careful society-wide orchestration, any subsequent attempt at suppressing the virus might need not be so disruptive.But these are just hunches; we are in unknown territory. That makes the Covid-19 emergency the mother of all risk-management problems, according to Gilberto Montibeller, professor of management science at Loughborough University.""The disease transmission models are not enough,"" says Montibeller. ""Epidemiologists have been driving policy, which is great, but we need to know other impacts beyond the number of people infected and the care they need. There is a lot of science, such as risk analysis, that hasn't been included in this debate. We also need more understanding of individual behaviour and group behaviour in a pandemic scenario. It's not just about mitigating risk but managing perceived risk too.""Soliciting these insights, Montibeller suggests, might have anticipated the panic-buying seen in several countries. That reaction was predictable, he says, given that the virus is a perfect toxic storm of the dreadful and the unknown.The behavioural science used to inform the UK government's response - trying to ""nudge"" people into staying at home - was also misjudged. ""Nudging wasn't created for these kinds of health threats and it isn't suitable here. Companies and governments now need to raise the quality of decision-making in this very difficult scenario.""In terms of shutting down epidemics, the west must look to Asian countries, which remembered the lessons from Sars. Hong Kong, Singapore and South Korea saw their commitment to surveillance, testing and contact tracing rewarded with flatter curves and fewer Covid-19 deaths. Restarting their economies may be a smoother task, since people will know, through testing, whether they have had the disease. New, accelerated ways of developing, testing and manufacturing vaccines will also be an urgent priority; the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations, formed in response to the Ebola outbreak, deserves credit for pushing this agenda as an economic imperative.The real and perceived threat of the Covid-19 virus to our future is clearly sky-high. It is an unfamiliar, lethal pathogen with no vaccine, no cure, not even a clear picture as to whether a person can be infected twice. Like all viruses, it mutates as it circulates. It is an invisible enemy in perpetual motion.There are reasons to be optimistic: the race for a vaccine has started, and last week WHO announced a global, nofrills ""mega-trial"" to see if existing drugs could be repurposed to treat Covid-19.But we do not have the upper hand yet.

Can its spread be slowed with the help of behavioural science? Anjana Ahuja reports,"T he sculpture, by renowned Indian sand artist Sudarsan Pattnaik, depicts a row of five health workers wearing face masks and staring at the viewer. The message underneath is simple and shaming: ""I stayed at work for you. You stay at home for us.""That slogan in silica captured the frustration felt by many on the front line against Covid-19. Sars-CoV-2, the coronavirus that causes it, is now on the rampage across the globe, partly sustained and amplified by human behaviour at every level.On an individual basis, we continued to commute to work, to socialise in bars and restaurants, and traipse to theatres and museums, even after health experts and politicians, alarmed by the crises unfolding in other countries, asked us not to. Back then, it seemed less disruptive to continue life as we knew it: we discounted the future and hoped the virus would burn itself out before reaching our doorstep.We have run out of doorsteps and the consequences are devastating beyond comprehension. The world changes day by day, hour by hour. On Tuesday, the UK, like so many other countries before it, began life under lockdown.Why did people flout social distancing advice? The coronavirus, suggests Professor Robin Dunbar, an evolutionary psychologist at Oxford university, exploits instinctive behavioural shortcuts long practised by our species. For most of our history, survival depended on being a member of a group. ""We are primates - the whole evolutionary strategy of primates is our intense sociality,"" he told me.

230,YOUR BRAIN NEEDS REGULAR EXERCISE TOO,"March 28, 2020 Saturday",International,The Daily Mail and Mail on Sunday (London),532,532,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,BY TONIA VOJTKOFSKY *BY ARRANGEMENT ONLY - CONTACT SOLO SYNDICATION*,YOUR BRAIN NEEDS REGULAR EXERCISE TOO,"* Memory quiz taken from Keep Your Brain Stronger For Longer by Tonia Vojtkofsky (Short Books, £9.99)Memory loss is experienced by almost all of us as we get older, particularly the loss of our short-term memory.While we are still able to remember much of what was learned in geography and chemistry 50 years before, or the names of the players in our favourite football team of that era, recently acquired information is not so well retained names, for example. This can be frustrating, but it is not a big problem and can be overcome.On top of this, reasoning and decision-making processes are slower as a result of ageing. But again, the actual size of the problem has been exaggerated, as indeed have the benefits of quick decision-making. I think we should reframe this as a positive, and re-claim our right to make decisions more carefully!I will concede that in certain situations (taking part in a quiz, for example), speed of thought is important, but most decisions, and certainly almost all serious decisions, do not need to be taken at speed.Young people who make decisions quickly may make the wrong decision!One reason for this, as outlined by Daniel Kahneman (winner of the Nobel Prize in Economics), is that people tend to think they are making decisions quickly and rationally when, in fact, the quick decision is often based on a rule of thumb that they have developed unconsciously and which can lead them down the wrong path.So it is not all about speed. The criticism that we older people are slow can be countered by saying that we are reflective decision-makers.There are many techniques that can be used to compensate for the loss of short-term memory. If you've forgotten someone's name, ask for their email address as that often is based on their name.If they have an usual sounding surname, ask them if they know the history of the family name. Your brain will then make new links that will jog your memory next time. Don't rely on a smartphone to record diary dates for you. Write them down instead and create a daily to-do' list which you can check each day to help jog your memory.If you keep losing things, get into the habit of always keeping those things it's often spectacles and keys! in the same place.Take steps to prevent the loss of other cognitive functions, such as decision-making, by giving your brain a daily workout. Include intellectual games such as sudoku and do a crossword every day. As soon as you feel it is less of a challenge move to the next level.Every day, challenge yourself to learn something new, such as researching your family history it's all about avoiding standing still and letting your brain atrophy.In the long term, consider volunteering to help children learn to read in understaffed school libraries. They are crying out for extra help, and studies have shown that depression is reduced when people feel valued and appreciated for their formal volunteering roles.For now, ask your family if you can set up a regular time to listen to your grandchild read using a tablet or smartphone. The more you do, the better.* Memory quiz taken from Keep Your Brain Stronger For Longer by Tonia Vojtkofsky (Short Books, £9.99)© Daily Mail",Papers

There follow six lively, well-argued chapters critiquing left liberals for their predisposition to support sexual freedom, assisted dying and technological transhumanism, and the right for its resistance to gun control, alleviating poverty and the rehabilitation of offenders.Like most political critiques, Mumford can't help occasionally caricaturising opinions he dislikes. Also, it is American Republicans, rather than the milder British Conservatives he used to advise as a think tanker, that are his main targets. Indeed, while the story of political polarisation in America is binary, here in the UK our new tribes have emerged from the Brexit-driven fragmentation of traditional divides.Tribes is an ambitious, and sometimes frustrating, mix of autobiography, social history and political manifesto. Lammy, Labour MP for Tottenham, north London, visits a Tuareg village in Niger, only later to reveal that the DNA test from which he traced these origins was probably erroneous. He poignantly describes feeling out of place as the only black child in his boarding school and a lonely executive in America. We are left wanting more of such candour, but much of the story involves Lammy unapologetically defending stances that others might have perceived as tribal. These include his opposition to the appointment of Sir Martin Moore-Bick to be chair of the inquiry into the Grenfell Tower fire disaster, on the grounds that the retired senior judge could not relate to the experience of living in a social housing estate, or attacking celebrity Stacey Dooley for acting the ""white saviour"" in emoting over an African child as part of the Comic Relief charity appeal. Lammy is not opposed to identity politics, so long as it is in pursuit of his view of social justice.To his credit, he does spend time listening to disillusioned citizens from west London and Peterborough to Wigan in north-west England. He even tries to understand what drove a rightwing extremist to violently and illegally troll him and other Labour MPs on Twitter.Loneliness, atomisation and the divisive tendencies of social media are among the usual suspects.Mumford's prescription for overcoming sectarianism is ethical commitment, or ""moral imagination"" as he puts it. Lammy's plan to make tribalism more inclusive is a fairly standard progressive platform involving democratic reform, decentralisation, redistribution including a Universal Basic Income and investment in community capacity. Mumford's position reads like an updated version of Catholic Social Teaching, while Lammy is a metropolitan left liberal, albeit with communitarian leanings. The problem for those who critique tribalism is that they are members themselves.There is already enough evidence of both communitarianism to inspire hope that the Covid-19 pandemic will bring us together, and of nationalism and selfishness to confirm fears it will widen our divisions.

234,"Finding the goodness in our tribal needs;Two books help us get to grips with tribalism but cannot escape the biases of their own tribes, writes Matthew Taylor","March 28, 2020 Saturday",International,"Financial Times (London, England)",1017,1017,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,,"Finding the goodness in our tribal needsTwo books help us get to grips with tribalism but cannot escape the biases of their own tribes, writes Matthew Taylor","P andemic discourse is just about the only kind of public conversation right now. Inevitably it is partly refracted through tribal affiliations and assumptions. In his talk of the ""Chinese virus"" and early decision to close borders, Donald Trump played to nativist sentiment, while, for progressives, Covid-19 underscores our global interdependence. Libertarians worry about the emergency powers being used by the state, while social democrats claim the crisis reveals how ""neoliberalism"" has weakened welfare and spread economic insecurity.Had coronavirus broken out a decade ago, we might not so readily have anticipated it being weaponised. But, as two more books on the subject are published, understanding tribalism has become an intellectual industry. In Vexed, James Mumford attempts to disrupt the sectarianism of political ideology, while in Tribes, David Lammy argues that progressive values and policies are the antidote.The background to both books lies in changes to the way we understand human motivation, reinforced by the decline in the liberal democratic consensus since its apparent high point at the turn of the century. Behavioural economists, evolutionary and social psychologists - and writers such as Jonathan Haidt and Yuval Noah Harari who have popularised their ideas - have shown how the actions and attitudes of modern people are difficult to explain without reference to our ""hardwired"" instinct for connectedness.The good news is our deep-seated propensity for altruism; the bad is our systematic bias towards our own group and against outsiders. Experiments find that research subjects can develop strong ingroup prejudice based on nothing more than the T-shirt colours people are asked to wear.Just as a more holistic understanding of human need and motives was becoming mainstream, the financial crisis hit. Populism had already been on the rise as people pushed back against globalisation and bureaucracies that seemed impervious to popular concerns ranging from rising inequality to the impact of mass immigration. Post-crash, increasing economic insecurity and flatlining living standards accelerated public disenchantment with what were portrayed as footloose liberal elites.Societies cannot move past the OECD's ""three Ps"" of pessimism, polarisation and populism until we find positive ways to channel our tribal needs. In essence, this has been the thesis in a slew of analyses of the crisis in liberal democracy, of which Amy Chua's Political Tribes and Francis Fukuyama's Identity are much quoted recent examples.

242,"How long will the UK coronavirus lockdown last?;Less than 12 hours after the Prime Minister's historic address to the nation, the London Underground was still jammed with commuters","March 28, 2020 Saturday",International,telegraph.co.uk,1244,1244,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,"By Sarah Knapton, Science Editor","How long will the UK coronavirus lockdown last?Less than 12 hours after the Prime Minister's historic address to the nation, the London Underground was still jammed with commuters","On Monday evening, Boris Johnson took the unprecedented step of curtailing individual freedoms to prevent the further spread of            coronavirus.The Prime Minister said that measures would be in place for three weeks-until April 13-and then reviewed. But given the expected trajectory of the disease, and the decisions taken by other countries who are ahead of Britain in terms of virus progression, it is unlikely the restrictions will be lifted then.•What the UK lockdown means for youFor a start, compared to most countries, the UK had a porous and half-hearted beginning to its isolation measures, with seemingly few people choosing to stay inside. Less than 12 hours after the Prime Minister's historic address to the nation on 23 March, the London Underground was jammed with commuters (see video below), while builders were seen eating together in communal canteens, making a mockery of the Government's rule that no more than two people can gather together in public.Prof Susan Michie, Director of the University College London's Centre for Behaviour Change, warned that some people would simply not be able to carry out the measures, even if they wanted to.""Five million self-employed people are being left potentially destitute by the Government failing to offer financial supportas they have done for directly employed workers,"" she said. ""Since [statutory sick pay of] £94 is not enough to pay rent, bills, food for a family etc, they will be forced to carry on as usual.""The British Transport Police is now on hand to make sure only            critical workers are using the London Underground. But such an inauspicious start to the lockdown suggests the virus will spread further than it would have, had stricter measures been implemented earlier,            as they have in other countries. And it means that the measures we do have are likely to be in place for longer to ""flatten the curve"" in a way that would prevent a second dangerous peak.Meanwhile, China has announced it will           finally be ending lockdown in Wuhanon April 8, a huge milestone for the country and a signal that the crisis-for them at least-is nearing its end. The city in Hubei province was the epicentre of the coronavirus outbreak.Yet it took more than two months of extremely draconian restrictions, including travel bans and quarantine zones, to achieve the level of containment seen in Wuhan. Britain is nowhere near that level of lockdown.And the Chinese restrictions were not lifted for more than 12 weeks after the first death, so if Britain follows a similar path, ours may need to be in place until the end of May/early June. Certainly, that is when the Government has said it expects cases to peak and then level out.However, from papers released last week, we know the Government is at least considering restricting movement for the rest of the year.The Scientific Pandemic Influenza Group on Modelling, which feeds into the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), proposed that because of the length of the outbreak, parts of the country could be placed in six-month lockdowns at a time, before being allowed more freedom. Prof Rowland Kao, the Sir Timothy O'Shea Professor of Veterinary Epidemiology and Data Science at the University of Edinburgh, said: ""It must be hoped that such measures will only last a relatively short time.""However, we must be prepared for this not to be the case, and for them to be in place for an extended period.""The next three weeks until the Prime Minister's review will be crucial, as the unfolding epidemic will now be seen in real time, rather than through modelling, allowing experts to make more accurate predictions of when it will peak, and finally die away. It is also possible that after three weeks it becomes apparent that the costs to shutting down society far outweigh the benefit of slowing the spread and the government may choose to lift restrictions even before the peak.•Listen to the daily podcastProf Mark Woolhouse, Professor of Infectious Disease Epidemiology, University of Edinburgh, said: ""We now enter a phase of careful monitoring. We are looking for indicators first that the epidemic is slowing down and then for numbers of new cases to start to fall. ""After three weeks we will have to decide whether the restrictions need to be continued, can be relaxed, or can be relaxed temporarily with the expectation of imposing them again later. ""We must also monitor the damage being that the lockdown is doing; damage to the economy, to education, to psychological well-being and to health and social care provision in the community. The impacts of this epidemic are too far reaching for policy decisions to be driven by epidemiology alone.""There are also hints that countries in Europe may be on a slightly faster course than China, and may peak sooner, meaning restrictions could be lifted earlier. While cases in China peaked some 72 days after the first recorded infections, public health officials in both Germany and Italy believe that they are starting to see a plateauing now, which could mean a peak of around 57 and 53 days respectively.Earlier this week, the Prime Minister said that we are two weeks behind Italy so Britain may end up peaking by the beginning of April. China left lockdown restrictions in place for nearly a month after the peak, so it is possible restrictions could be lifted early in May.Prof Sheila Bird said that more cases in coming days and weeks would make it easier for the Government to predict how the epidemic is responding to lockdown measures which will inform how long they remain in place. She said: ""Once an epidemic takes hold, as now in UK, the country's own data - properly reported and interpreted - take precedence over modelling as the data tell us the actual actual toll which the epidemic is exacting""A huge amount can be inferred about the immediately forthcoming weeks from these data directly, including whether further policy changes are needed to reinforce social-distancing, for example in particular age groups.""Some experts are still concerned that the current restrictions do not go far enough while others say the government has been hit by an 'epidemic of action', and is now bringing in measures that have little rationale. Prof Robert Dingwall, Professor of Sociology, at Nottingham Trent University, wrote in The Telegraph: ""It is another triumph of populism over science, of a capitulation to the demand to 'do something'. ""We are still seeing some notion that 'the people' are selfish and must be bullied and disciplined. ""The people are not selfish: they have behaved in ways that are individually rational but have collectively irrational results.""However Dr Andrea Collins, Senior Clinical Lecturer in Respiratory Medicine at the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine (LSTM), said: ""I believe that they have not quite gone far enough. The 'absolutely' necessary to go to work is still being used by some when it is not required-I think we need permits across controlled areas to go to a workplace.""Recent modelling from the universities of Exeter, Bristol and Warwick suggested that without any measures at all, the epidemic would have peaked around 133 days after first person-to-person transmission in Britain, which happened around February 28. So the lockdown has the potential of curtailing the spread by around seven weeks. A welcome relief for people who could have been facing lockdown for most of the summer.",Newspaper; Web Publication
243,TOO SLOW TO ACT' Boris Johnson accused of coronavirus complacency after he & Matt Hancock are diagnosed & Chris Whitty isolates himself,"March 28, 2020 Saturday",International,thesun.co.uk,753,753,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,Alahna Kindred,TOO SLOW TO ACT' Boris Johnson accused of coronavirus complacency after he & Matt Hancock are diagnosed & Chris Whitty isolates himself,"                                             BORIS Johnson has been accused of being complacent over his own social distancing advice after he and Matt Hancock tested positive for coronavirus.The Prime Minister and Health Secretary announced yesterday they had Covid-19 and Chief Medical Officer Chris Whitty revealed he is self-isolating after coming down with symptoms.                                             Read ourcoronavirus live blog for the latest news & updates                   Experts have criticised No10's response to the coronavirus outbreak as ""slow"".On Monday, millions around the UK watched Mr Johnson's historic address where he ordered everyone to ""stay at home"" to help curb the spread of the killer bug.However, Mr Johnson continued to carry out his parliamentary duties this week, including Prime Minister's Questions on Wednesday.Since Monday, the press briefings have been carried out by video link - but critics said this should have happened sooner.They have also pointed out senior government figures haven't always kept a two metre distance from each other, in accordance with official advise.Dr John Ashton, a former regional director of Public Health England, said senior government figures testing positive for coronavirus show why the UK's lockdown should have come sooner.He said: ""The government has been too slow to act on this, and they've been slow as individuals. I was surprised to see Prime Minister questions going ahead this week - it was clearly unnecessary.""It reinforces the view that lockdown measures taken earlier this week should have been taken sooner, and raises questions about the ability of people in power, including the prime minister, to discipline themselves.""Professor Susan Michie, director of the centre for behaviour change at University College London, said: ""Those in leadership positions should practise what they preach.""If leaders do not adhere to their own recommendations, this undermines trust in them, which in turn can undermine the population's adherence to their advice.""She said it ""should not come as a surprise"" that the PM and Health Secretary have both tested positive.Michael Gove, minister for the Cabinet Office, defended the government's approach yesterday saying ti shows how the killer bug ""does not discriminate"" and ""we are all at risk"".He said: ""The fact that the virus is no respecter of individuals, whoever they are, is one of the reasons why we do need to have strict social distancing measures.""This morning, Scottish Secretary Alister Jack said he is in isolation after developing coronavirus symptoms.He said he developed a cough and mild temperature three days after he was sat alongside the PM in the Commons before PMQs.The Tory MP for Dumfries and Galloway said: ""In the past 24 hours, I have developed mild symptoms associated with coronavirus.""In line with medical guidance, I am self-isolating and working from home.""  Downing Street said yesterday that others in contact with the PM did not need to do so unless they develop symptoms - and they were not aware of any other ministers having a test.Chancellor Rishi Sunak, seen with the PM outside No 10 last night, has shown no signs of the bug and is not isolating.Coronavirus victims are thought to be contagious for between two and 12 days before symptoms start appearing.Sir Patrick Vallance, the UK's chief scientific adviser, said: ""It looks quite likely that there is some degree of asymptomatic transmission.""There's definitely quite a lot of transmission very early in the disease when there are very mild symptoms.""On Monday, Mr Johnson ordered all non-essential business to close and banned travel unless it was for an essential job or reason. Brits were also told they could only leave the house for exercise like a walk or a jog, to go work if they are a key worker and to buy essential items such as food or medicine.Police have been given powers to arrest people flouting the lockdown mandate as well as issue fines.Mr Johnson said this lockdown is going to be imposed for at least three weeks - but didn't rule out extending it if necessary.

244,"Birds, buds and bright days: how spring can make us healthier and happier;Longer, lighter days can help us banish old habits, sleep better and improve our mental health, even during the lockdown","March 29, 2020 Sunday",International,The Guardian (London),1388,1388,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,Amy Fleming,"Birds, buds and bright days: how spring can make us healthier and happierLonger, lighter days can help us banish old habits, sleep better and improve our mental health, even during the lockdown","Thank goodness that, in this time of crisis, it is now spring. In the northern hemisphere, at least, we can say hello to green shoots, flowers, bumblebees and butterflies. Finally, the clocks have gone back to British Summer Time. We've lost an hour of sleep, but hello, light.The greatest hope for the new season this year is that           better weather will start to make           it harder for coronavirus to spread. And for those lucky enough to still have their health, spring can provide other consolations. Its strong sense of a new beginning nudges our outlook and actions in welcome ways. Katherine Milkman, a behavioural scientist at the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania, has studied the phenomenon and found that there is more to spring cleaning than the sunlight suddenly showing up cobwebs and window smears. ""The start of spring generally makes us feel more motivated - it's a so-called 'fresh start date',"" she says. As such, it makes us feel less connected to the past. ""That disconnect gives us a sense that whatever we messed up on previously, we can get right now. Maybe the old you failed to quit smoking or start a lasting exercise routine, but the new you can do it.""These moments, she says, also tend ""to promote bigger-picture thinking, which gets us focused on our goals"". Whether facing health, financial or professional worries, newly working from home or home schooling, or being suddenly at a loss for something to do, Milkman says this effect can stretch ""across all of our goal-oriented activities. We've seen that it affects everything from decisions about exercise to retirement savings.""Spring can also fortify us with the relief it brings from seasonal affective disorder (Sad). Even if you do not have a clinical case of it, says Hugh Selsick, chair of the            sleep working group at the Royal College of Psychiatrists, ""most people will experience some degree of lifting of mood in the summer months"". Studies looking at populations in North America have illustrated this neatly, according to Selsick. ""The further north you go, the worse our mood gets in the winter, because of that lack of light. For us [in the north] the payoff is that we also get these really nice bright long, spring and summer days.""As humans, we evolved in a tropical place, where there was a lot more light,"" Selsick says. This means our brains have evolved to expect a certain amount of it. ""It's probably why we are so susceptible to changes in light,"" he says. And why the gloomier months can negatively affect sleep patterns and mood.Sad symptoms that spring might alleviate include low mood, tiredness, sleeping longer than normal and, says Selsick, cravings of carbohydrates in particular. So feel free to harness this knowledge to fuel a new effort to start exceeding your five a day.Now that most of us are only allowed out once a day, for exercise, the greatest gains in terms of making the most of spring light are to be had from stepping out first thing in the morning. Not only will getting up and out help avoid the crowds of joggers, but morning light is the most crucial for setting our circadian rhythms. ""It's much better at synchronising our body clocks and getting us back into sync with the outside world,"" says Selsick.When it's dark, we produce melatonin, which acts as a time signal to the body, telling it we should be sleepy. ""That first bit of light in the morning,"" says Selsick, ""is very effective at switching that melatonin off, which then tells the brain and the rest of the body it's now time to be awake and active.""We have a special set of receptors in our eyes which communicate directly with the body clock in the brain,"" he adds. ""They're particularly sensitive to blue-green light, which on a [sunny] day like today is the colour of the sky. So that sort of bright sunlight, that outdoor light is what our brains are particularly sensitive to."" Exposure to this in the morning helps us to wake up and shake off bleary-eyed grumpiness. ""And it helps to regulate our sleep. If your body knows when the day is starting, it's easier for it to also know at what time it needs to start winding down and getting ready for sleep."" And of course sleeping well has the positive knock-on effect of giving you a better shot at feeling content and having good overall health.The big danger with being locked down, warns Selsick, is ""allowing your whole rhythm to drift"". Even if a temporary break from commuting allows you to sleep in a little, keep your waking-up time consistent to reap the benefits of the spring sunshine. ""If you're getting that first dose of light at a different time every morning, your body has no idea where it is in time,"" he says. ""You're essentially jet-lagging your body by having a different rising time every day."" Setting regular meal times helps keep our daily rhythms in sync, too.It's essential that we make the most of opportunities to be outside, whether it's that one permitted outing, or additional gardening, or spending some time on the balcony. ""The more outdoors you can get the better, without getting in close contact with people,"" says Selsick.Getting some sun can fill our heads with new ideas, too. In 2005, psychologists at the University of Michigan found that half an hour out in the sun boosted not only mood, but also memory and creativity. To test the latter, they assessed changes in what they call cognitive broadening - ""a style of thinking in which people become more creative and which is hypothesised to be an adaptive shift in cognition that leads to behavioral flexibility and exploration"", write the authors.Late-evening light may be less likely to have an impact on circadian rhythms than morning rays, but, says Selsick, ""people do generally report a better quality of life if they have some light in the evening"". Indeed. A 2016 study by researchers at Brigham Young University in Utah looked at six years of data from more than 16,000 adults and found that seasonal increases in hours of sunshine correlated with decreased mental health distress.Longer days also seem to extend the amount of use we get from waking hours. When it's light in the evenings, it feels like daytime for longer. Staying up to batch cook, bake bread or, in the current climate, have beers with friends over Zoom, will seem appealing all of a sudden. ""Light does to some extent push sleep away a little bit,"" says Selsick. ""And people do often feel more alert when there's bright light.""And of course, with spring, light and warmth comes nature. April will see the return of swallows, swifts, cuckoos, martins and other feathery summer visitors. The more birds we see in our neighbourhoods, and the more greenery, the more robust our mental health will be, according to a 2017 study by the University of Exeter. In 2019, data from 20,000 British people crunched by researchers at the same university showed that            the more time spent enjoying nature, the greater life satisfaction reported.This is why GPs have been prescribing gardening as therapy. So plant some seeds and watch them grow, whether that's in a flowerbed or a window-sill or balcony pot. Get a bird feeder - ensuring it's inaccessible to squirrels, which are bird's nest predators. Dig out your binoculars and indulge in some twitching, or figure out (with some online help) which song belongs to which bird. The green shoots of a new chapter in our lives provide opportunities to do better, says Milkman. ""The Covid-19 crisis is inaugurating a new era and shaking up our routines. Horrific as the crisis is, it presents an opportunity to size up our routines and consider what we want to change and how we can be better. I hope people will capitalise on that motivation and find ways to help one another (from a requisite social distance) and themselves achieve important goals.""Yes, we are on lockdown. We may be emotionally exhausted and scared, but at least spring makes our daily outdoor exercise allowance more enticing. On warmer days, we can throw open the windows, let the fresh air flood in and expel the indoor pollutants that have accumulated from a winter's worth of cooking and cleaning. We can welcome the reduction in traffic noise and fumes. These may be bittersweet byproducts of virus hell, but it's all the better to hear the birds.",Newspaper
245,SPAIN'S HELL;832 DEAD IN 24 HOURS ON WORST DAY YET,"March 29, 2020 Sunday",International,The Sun (England),1309,1309,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,DANIEL HAMMOND,SPAIN'S HELL832 DEAD IN 24 HOURS ON WORST DAY YET,"By DANIEL HAMMOND EMBATTLED Spain announced 832 losses from coronavirus yesterday as the nation's death toll hit a devastating 5,690.The virus reached to the heart of the country on Friday after Princess Maria Teresa died aged 86 after testing positive for Covid-19.Hospitals and morgues across Spain were left overwhelmed as the total number of positive cases soared to 72,248 from 64,059.A temporary morgue was set up at an ice rink in Madrid, where health workers warned services are ""collapsing"" due to patient numbers.Health emergency chief Fernando Simon said the epidemic appeared to be reaching its peak in some areas but the nation was short of intensive care unit beds.He said: ""We continue to have a major problem with ICU saturation.""As Spain prepared to enter its third week of lockdown, an unused public building known as ""the doughnut"" was the latest to be turned into a makeshift morgue after the ice rink last week.Spanish Ministry of Health figures showed that 4,575 people have been admitted to intensive care and 12,285 people have been cured of the disease.The head of the country's terror cops, Jesus Gayoso Rey, died aged 48 in hospital on Friday after catching coronavirus.Princess Maria Teresa of the Bourbon-Parma royal family, passed away on Friday, her younger brother, Prince Sixtus Henry of Bourbon-Parma, announced.She was born in Paris, France, on July 28, 1933 to parents Prince Xavier and Madeleine de Bourbon, who had a total of six children.The royals are members of the House of Bourbon-Parma which is a cadet branch of the Spanish royal family.Spanish government officials expressed hope the coming days will mark the peak of the spread of Coronavirus, but warned the peak in the deaths is likely to come later.Doctors, nurses and ambulance drivers in the country's worst-hit regions are working nonstop and falling ill at an alarming rate. More than 9,000 health workers in the country have been infected.Paramedic Pablo Rojo at Barcelonas Dos de Maig hospital said staff were ""completely overwhelmed"".He added: ""Seven or eight (patients transported today) and all with Covid-19. And the average age is decreasing. They're not 80 years old anymore, they are now 30 and 40 years old.""Only Italy's single-day death tally is worse than Spain's - with 969 dying from Coronavirus there between Thursday and Friday.But yesterday's grim death toll placed Spain in second place as the worst-hit country ahead of China with 3,295 in total.Italy yesterday recorded a total of 10,023 deaths from the virus since its outbreak, up from 889. And the total number of confirmed cases in the country reached 92,472.Italy's Lombardy region, which has borne the worst of the Coronavirus, recorded 542 new deaths alone.In parts of Africa, meanwhile, virus prevention measures took a violent turn as countries imposed lockdowns and curfews or sealed off major cities.Police in Kenya fired tear gas and officers elsewhere were captured on video hitting people with batons.Russia said its borders would be fully closed as of Monday.The number of worldwide infections surpassed 620,000 with more than 28,000 deaths as new cases also stacked up quickly in Europe, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University.While the US now leads the world in reported cases, five countries exceed its roughly 1,700 deaths: Italy, Spain, China, Iran and France. New York remained the worst-hit US www.city.Gov Andrew Cuomo said defeating the virus will take many weeks.Cases also have been rising rapidly in cities such as Detroit, where poverty and poor health have been problems for years. The number of infections surged to 1,381, with 31 deaths, as of noon yesterday.At this time, the trajectory of Detroit is unfortunately even more steep than that of New York, said Dr Teena Chopra, the medical director of infection prevention and hospital epidemiology at the Detroit Medical Center.Lockdowns of varying severity have been introduced across Europe, nearly emptying streets in normally bustling cities, including Paris where drone photos showed landmarks eerily deserted. German Chancellor Angela Merkel appealed to her country, which has experienced fewer deaths compared with some neighbouring countries, to be patient.Her chief of staff said Germany, where authorities closed nonessential shops and banned public gatherings of more than two, won't relax its restrictions before April 20.As the epicentre has shifted westward, the situation has calmed in China, where some restrictions have been lifted.Stricken princess ... Maria Teresa Six subway lines restored limited service in Wuhan, where the virus first emerged in December, after the city had its virus risk evaluation downgraded from high to medium.Five districts of the city of 11 million people had other travel restrictions loosened after their risk factor was reduced to low.For most people, the Coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough that clear up in two to three weeks. But for others, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, the virus can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia, and lead to death.More than 135,000 people have recovered, according to Johns Hopkins. The effects of the outbreak have been felt by the powerful and the poor alike.As British Prime Minister Boris Johnson became the first leader of a major country to test positive for the virus, another member of his cabinet also developed symptoms, as the number of people in the UK who have died for the illness passed the 1,000 mark.Johnson is being accused of failing to follow his own self-distancing rules, though he is in selfquarantine now.Some 1,019 people have now died from Coronavirus in the UK after the deadliest 24 hours to date saw 260 people die.Government advisers have warned tougher lockdown and social distancing measures could be brought into place as 17,089 people have now tested positive for Covid-19 in the UK.It is the biggest surge in Coronavirus deaths there so far - up from yesterday's tally of 759.It is hoped that the UK's current lockdown measures could help reduce the surging death rate from an eventual 260,000 people to 5,700.Statisticians at Imperial College London have calculated that the UK can avoid 260,000 deaths if it keeps on the same path as China.They emphasised it shows the current government strategy for dealing with the bug is working.The government itself came under increased pressure on Friday, when the Prime Minister and Health Secretary Matt Hancock both tested positive for the bug.Chief Medical Officer Chris Whitty also said he was suffering symptoms, adding that he would self-isolate as a precaution.Since Monday, the press briefings have been carried out by video link - but critics said this should have happened sooner.They have also pointed out senior government figures haven't always kept a two-metre distance from each other, in accordance with official advice.Dr John Ashton, a former regional director of Public Health England, said senior government figures testing positive for Coronavirus show why the UK's lockdown should have come sooner.He said: ""The government has been too slow to act on this, and they've been slow as individuals.

BURP! - and then push it out through webinars, conferences and lucrative coaching sessions.As a superforecaster, my hunch is the whole speaking circuit will come roaring back after this. It's my easily digested leadership pabulum that will be in demand. Hello? Did someone mute me? Katherine, the worried worker Thanks for the invite. Should I be on this call?

250,"How long will the UK coronavirus lockdown last?;Less than 12 hours after the Prime Minister's historic address to the nation, the London Underground was still jammed with commuters","March 30, 2020 Monday",International,telegraph.co.uk,1244,1244,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,"By Sarah Knapton, Science Editor","How long will the UK coronavirus lockdown last?Less than 12 hours after the Prime Minister's historic address to the nation, the London Underground was still jammed with commuters","On Monday evening, Boris Johnson took the unprecedented step of curtailing individual freedoms to prevent the further spread of            coronavirus.The Prime Minister said that measures would be in place for three weeks-until April 13-and then reviewed. But given the expected trajectory of the disease, and the decisions taken by other countries who are ahead of Britain in terms of virus progression, it is unlikely the restrictions will be lifted then.•What the UK lockdown means for youFor a start, compared to most countries, the UK had a porous and half-hearted beginning to its isolation measures, with seemingly few people choosing to stay inside. Less than 12 hours after the Prime Minister's historic address to the nation on 23 March, the London Underground was jammed with commuters (see video below), while builders were seen eating together in communal canteens, making a mockery of the Government's rule that no more than two people can gather together in public.Prof Susan Michie, Director of the University College London's Centre for Behaviour Change, warned that some people would simply not be able to carry out the measures, even if they wanted to.""Five million self-employed people are being left potentially destitute by the Government failing to offer financial supportas they have done for directly employed workers,"" she said. ""Since [statutory sick pay of] £94 is not enough to pay rent, bills, food for a family etc, they will be forced to carry on as usual.""The British Transport Police is now on hand to make sure only            critical workers are using the London Underground. But such an inauspicious start to the lockdown suggests the virus will spread further than it would have, had stricter measures been implemented earlier,            as they have in other countries. And it means that the measures we do have are likely to be in place for longer to ""flatten the curve"" in a way that would prevent a second dangerous peak.Meanwhile, China has announced it will           finally be ending lockdown in Wuhanon April 8, a huge milestone for the country and a signal that the crisis-for them at least-is nearing its end. The city in Hubei province was the epicentre of the coronavirus outbreak.Yet it took more than two months of extremely draconian restrictions, including travel bans and quarantine zones, to achieve the level of containment seen in Wuhan. Britain is nowhere near that level of lockdown.And the Chinese restrictions were not lifted for more than 12 weeks after the first death, so if Britain follows a similar path, ours may need to be in place until the end of May/early June. Certainly, that is when the Government has said it expects cases to peak and then level out.However, from papers released last week, we know the Government is at least considering restricting movement for the rest of the year.The Scientific Pandemic Influenza Group on Modelling, which feeds into the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), proposed that because of the length of the outbreak, parts of the country could be placed in six-month lockdowns at a time, before being allowed more freedom. Prof Rowland Kao, the Sir Timothy O'Shea Professor of Veterinary Epidemiology and Data Science at the University of Edinburgh, said: ""It must be hoped that such measures will only last a relatively short time.""However, we must be prepared for this not to be the case, and for them to be in place for an extended period.""The next three weeks until the Prime Minister's review will be crucial, as the unfolding epidemic will now be seen in real time, rather than through modelling, allowing experts to make more accurate predictions of when it will peak, and finally die away. It is also possible that after three weeks it becomes apparent that the costs to shutting down society far outweigh the benefit of slowing the spread and the government may choose to lift restrictions even before the peak.•Listen to the daily podcastProf Mark Woolhouse, Professor of Infectious Disease Epidemiology, University of Edinburgh, said: ""We now enter a phase of careful monitoring. We are looking for indicators first that the epidemic is slowing down and then for numbers of new cases to start to fall. ""After three weeks we will have to decide whether the restrictions need to be continued, can be relaxed, or can be relaxed temporarily with the expectation of imposing them again later. ""We must also monitor the damage being that the lockdown is doing; damage to the economy, to education, to psychological well-being and to health and social care provision in the community. The impacts of this epidemic are too far reaching for policy decisions to be driven by epidemiology alone.""There are also hints that countries in Europe may be on a slightly faster course than China, and may peak sooner, meaning restrictions could be lifted earlier. While cases in China peaked some 72 days after the first recorded infections, public health officials in both Germany and Italy believe that they are starting to see a plateauing now, which could mean a peak of around 57 and 53 days respectively.Earlier this week, the Prime Minister said that we are two weeks behind Italy so Britain may end up peaking by the beginning of April. China left lockdown restrictions in place for nearly a month after the peak, so it is possible restrictions could be lifted early in May.Prof Sheila Bird said that more cases in coming days and weeks would make it easier for the Government to predict how the epidemic is responding to lockdown measures which will inform how long they remain in place. She said: ""Once an epidemic takes hold, as now in UK, the country's own data - properly reported and interpreted - take precedence over modelling as the data tell us the actual actual toll which the epidemic is exacting""A huge amount can be inferred about the immediately forthcoming weeks from these data directly, including whether further policy changes are needed to reinforce social-distancing, for example in particular age groups.""Some experts are still concerned that the current restrictions do not go far enough while others say the government has been hit by an 'epidemic of action', and is now bringing in measures that have little rationale. Prof Robert Dingwall, Professor of Sociology, at Nottingham Trent University, wrote in The Telegraph: ""It is another triumph of populism over science, of a capitulation to the demand to 'do something'. ""We are still seeing some notion that 'the people' are selfish and must be bullied and disciplined. ""The people are not selfish: they have behaved in ways that are individually rational but have collectively irrational results.""However Dr Andrea Collins, Senior Clinical Lecturer in Respiratory Medicine at the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine (LSTM), said: ""I believe that they have not quite gone far enough. The 'absolutely' necessary to go to work is still being used by some when it is not required-I think we need permits across controlled areas to go to a workplace.""Recent modelling from the universities of Exeter, Bristol and Warwick suggested that without any measures at all, the epidemic would have peaked around 133 days after first person-to-person transmission in Britain, which happened around February 28. So the lockdown has the potential of curtailing the spread by around seven weeks. A welcome relief for people who could have been facing lockdown for most of the summer.",Newspaper; Web Publication

The outsourcing giant sparked anger among workers when a senior manager told them last week they would only get the statutory minimum because he believed Covid-19 was ""less severe than flu"". Less than 24 hours after the Guardian first reported the firm's controversial position and with the death toll from the virus rising, Amey has announced that any employee who is affected by Covid-19 because they are sick or are self-isolating will receive full pay rather than statutory sick pay with immediate effect.  Related:  UK firm won't pay higher sick pay as Covid-19 'less severe than flu'Amanda Fisher, the chief executive of the services company with prison, defence and council contracts and a £2.3bn-a-year turnover, also issued a public apology. The new terms are likely to benefit up to 3,000 of the firm's 17,000 employees who were facing the lowest rates of sick pay.The attempt to downplay the severity of the illness which has claimed at least 33,000 lives globally, was described as ""shocking"" by the GMB union. It also appeared to be factually wrong. Flu has been calculated to be fatal in 0.1-0.2% of cases. Chris Whitty, England's chief medical officer, has predicted that coronavirus would kill around 1% of the people who contracted it, and there are fears that figure could be higher.Announcing its U-turn, Fisher said: We take pride in our employees being the driving force behind our business and we realise that on this occasion we got it wrong, for which we apologise. We have conducted an immediate review of our policy and can announce that any employee who is affected by Covid-19 - because they are sick or are self-isolating - will not be penalised for the effects of coronavirus.This decision has been made to help protect our employees in the midst of the current coronavirus pandemic, and ensure we are following government guidelines for keeping employees safe from the unnecessary spread of infection.block-time updated-timeUpdated at 6.27pm BSTblock-time published-time 6.20pm BST The mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, has written to every Premier League and Championship football club in the capital asking they provide assistance to the NHS in ""unprecedented times"" amid the fight against coronavirus.In a letter sent this week, Khan asked the ten clubs to provide help in three key areas: access to medical staff, access to stadium facilities and accommodation for NHS workers living away from their families, as well as for health and care workers who need easy access to field hospitals.Read the full story here.

The commission, which monitors and advises on mental health legislation in Scotland, said it was particularly worried about the government's decision to scrap the normal procedures used when a council or hospital wants to move a patient with dementia or other mental illnesses out of a hospital bed into a care facility.Until now, a patient's opinions or previous views on where they wanted to be treated would be taken into account, or their guardian or family member with power of attorney would be consulted; any disagreements could end up in a sheriff court hearing.The commission said those were now being temporarily removed, without any process for those decisions to be overseen or monitored. That meant a mentally-ill patient could end up in a care home without their or their guardian's consent, to free up hospital beds for other patients.In a policy memorandum published alongside the bill, the Scottish government said it was justified because elderly patients were the most vulnerable to the coronavirus, while the crisis meant extra beds were desperately needed.The government said: Hospitals are looking to increase dramatically the number of beds available to deal with the expected large influx of patients affected by coronavirus and requiring hospital treatment. Adults lacking capacity are often elderly patients with dementia who are at high risk from coronavirus and it is a high priority to move them to somewhere safer and more suitable for their care and treatment.Dr Arun Chopra, the commission's medical director, said it was very concerned about the rights of those patients. We understand the need for this emergency legislation to become available during these exceptional times, but we would want to see the reduction in safeguards to only be used if absolutely necessary, and for as short a time as is possible.We believe it is vital that effective mechanisms are in place to scrutinise how and when these powers are used.The commission said it would adapt its monitoring systems to cope with the emergency powers published in the new coronavirus (Scotland) bill, and the impact the pandemic had on services. But it said ministers needed to amend the bill to require councils to notify a statutory body every time these orders were used.block-time published-time 6.10pm BST The Swedish furniture giant Ikea has today reopened the doors of its Croydon store - but only for vulnerable customers and key workers who can shop for essentials at its Swedish food market.The rest of the store will remain closed but the Swedish food market is opening to key workers at different times, including NHS workers and police, the elderly, most vulnerable and their carers and Ikea co-workers.Its normal range has been bolstered with staple items including bread, milk, butter and canned tomatoes. Other members of the public will not be admitted.The decision to prioritise this location is due to the store's proximity to Croydon University hospital - just one mile away and one of the worst-hit by coronavirus in London.The store will initially open to key workers Monday-Friday between 8am-12pm and 2pm-4pm, while elderly and vulnerable customers and carers can visit between 12pm-2pm. Customers will be asked to show ID to gain entrance.In order to ensure customers and co-workers' safety, Ikea is implementing measures to enforce 2 metres distance between shoppers and staff, with payment by card only.Gary Pearce, store manager at Ikea Croydon, says: Now more than ever we need to come together as a community. We want to do everything we can to support those most in need, including NHS workers at our local hospitals. By offering some essential food items alongside our Swedish food range, we hope that we can help to make their everyday lives just a little bit easier during these tough times.block-time updated-timeUpdated at 6.16pm BSTblock-time published-time 6.09pm BST Jason Groves, political editor of the Daily Mail asked about testing and ""why we are doing so badly"" compared to Germany. Gove said the increase in the number of deaths was ""shocking and disturbing"" and it is right to increase the testing. Dr Harries said ""we want to be testing where it is useful"" and testing for clinical care is a priority, then getting front line workers back into safe work. She said: We have started a number of tests at the PHE facility and other scientists working in testing cohorts of groups of people, which are age specified if you like so that we can start to get a good idea of how many people in the population have had it and then extrapolate that number out so we get a picture for the whole country. That is more of a clue in many ways in managing the end of the outbreak and when we can take the locks off.She said a postal test which the government is trying to roll out would be ""extremely useful"".block-time published-time 6.04pm BST The BBC News At Six presenter, George Alagiah, who is being treated for cancer, has said that he had tested positive for coronavirus. His wife, Fran, has also experienced symptoms.Alagiah had decided earlier this month that he was going to stop appearing on air from the studio amid the virus outbreak following advice from doctors and colleagues. He told BBC News At Six's Sophie Raworth: In some ways, I think that we, those of us living with cancer, are stronger because we kind of know what it is like to go into something where the outcomes are uncertain. I certainly feel that having had that experience, in my case six years as a cancer patient, I went into this feeling actually quite strong, if I can live with cancer, I can certainly live with Covid-19.enltrGeorge Alagiah who's being treated for cancer reveals he has had coronavirus. @BBCAlagiah talks to me on            @BBCNews at six            #bbcnewssix - sophieraworth (@sophieraworth) March 31, 2020block-time updated-timeUpdated at 6.08pm BSTblock-time published-time 6.01pm BST Gove said the sharp rise in UK deaths from coronavirus was ""deeply shocking"" but he could not say exactly when the peak would come: There's not a fixed date like Easter when you know that the peak will come, it depends on the actions of all of us. We can delay that peak, we can flatten the curve through our own particular actions. Powis said the sequence of progress would involve a reduction in the number of infections, followed by a reduction in the number of hospitalisations a week or two later, and then finally a reduction in the number of deaths: I expect that we will still see unfortunately a rise in deaths because that is the measure that unfortunately we will turn around last.block-time published-time 5.52pm BST On PPE, Harries said she had optimistically said 10 days ago they had ""solved the PPE position"", but admitted that 48 hours later the distribution problems had started again in getting the equipment to the right places. She said they then started to take a UK wide approach to logistics and deliver the products went to where the risk was. They are setting up a new electronic system to request PPE which might be useful for care homes:The distribution element has been a little bit tricky at times and we have now taken a whole strand of the logistics, including with the army's support actually, out so that we are developing a UK position on that stock and distribution flow. And the underlying critical point about this is that the PPE should go to match where the critical, clinical risk is.block-time updated-timeUpdated at 5.58pm BSTblock-time published-time 5.46pm BST On end of life care, Powis said: I would expect end of life care to be just as good as it is in normal times and I know that's something that our clinicians and hospitals and other health care facilities are thinking about very carefully. Clearly with the additional impact of this particular virus we do need to think carefully about when people are discharged from hospital if they have had the Covid, and so we have issued specific guidance to assist in that discharge, for instance, if discharging into care homes. So we have taken account of the fact that over and above our normal procedures we need to take account that we have a new infectious disease.block-time published-time 5.45pm BST New services involving the RAF have been unveiled to help coronavirus patients by speeding up medical transport. Michael Gove said three RAF Puma helicopters are stationed at Kinloss barracks in Moray, Scotland, and will work with Chinook helicopters based at RAF Leeming in North Yorkshire to respond to requests for assistance from NHS trusts across Scotland and the north of England.  A second helicopter facility for the south is based at RAF Benson, South Oxfordshire. An RAF transport aircraft has already been used in an evacuation of a critically ill patient to Aberdeen for treatment. Updated at 5.59pm BST5.36pm BST'People's sacrifices are worth it, they are making a difference, we must not let up' - GoveGove said there are some signs, as Powis has said, that people are observing physical distancing and that we may be able to flatten the spread of infection. But he added firmly: Now is absolutely not the time for people to imagine that there can be any relaxation or slackening. It is a hopeful sign but we must be wary of over-interpreting any individual day's data. We must maintain this united national effort in order to keep people safe. People's sacrifices are worth it, they are making a difference, but we must not let up. Updated at 5.38pm BST5.29pm BSTSome signs we are flattening spread of infection, but we must not be complacentStephen Powis, medical director of NHS England, said the NHS needs everyone in the country to play their part in reducing transmission of the virus, which will take pressure off the health system and prevent more deaths. Social contact has been reducing over the last few weeks, Powis said, proving the public was heeding the advice. For example, transport use has decreased dramatically. Less social contact means a lower chance the virus can pass from one person to another. Over time that will mean a lower number of people testing positive. That will also translate into a lower number of hospital admissions, which typically takes place two weeks after transmission.The rate of hospitalisation is currently increasing, which is expected at this stage. But if social contact continues to decline, the number of hospitalisations will also. China over time has flattened the curve and the number of deaths has reduced.Powis said there was a ""bit of a plateau"" in the number of new cases of people testing positive for Covid-19 in the UK, however: We have had a rise in the number of UK cases but recently there's a little bit of a plateau. I think it's really important not to read too much into this because it's early days. We're not out of the woods; we're very much in the wood. But as you can see the number of infections is not rising as rapidly as it was. So green shoots but only green shoots and we must not be complacent and we must not take our foot off the pedal.Updated at 6.15pm BST5.19pm BSTThousands of new ventilators to be delivered to NHS next week - GoveA critical constraint on the ability to rapidly increase testing capacity is the availability of the chemical reagents that are necessary in the testing, Gove said. The health secretary and the prime minister are working with companies worldwide to ensure we get the material we need to increase tests of all kinds.Gove said we have just over 8,000 ventilators deployed in NHS hospitals now, but we need more. We are buying more from abroad, including from EU nations, and developing new sources of supply at home.This weekend the first thousands of new ventilator devices will roll off the production line and be delivered to the NHS next week. From there they will be distributed to the frontline.Also, the government is increasing capacity to provide oxygen to patients at earlier stages of the disease, hoping to prevent deterioration. Gove said they are also conducting rapid clinical trials on those drugs, including antimalarials, which may be able to reduce the impact of Covid-19 to those affected.Updated at 5.22pm BST5.14pm BSTMichael Gove has said that 143,186 people in the UK have now been tested for Covid-19. Of those 25,150 tested positive. Yesterday saw the highest single increase in the number of deaths - 381 people died. Of those that have been hospitalised in the UK, 1,789 have died.10,767 people in England have been admitted to hospital with Covid-19 symptoms. The largest number is in London, where 3,915 people are in hospital care. In the Midlands, the number is 1,918 and this is accelerating upwards.Gove says these numbers serve to reinforce the importance of following physical distancing guidelines.Updated at 5.16pm BST4.46pm BSTDaily news briefingThe Cabinet Office Minister Michael Gove will front today's Downing Street press conference, due to begin shortly.

Rochdale council and other local authorities have told the Guardian that the parcels they have received have been completely inadequate; neither covering the numbers of vulnerable households in their area nor providing decent nutrition. Rochdale council said it was sent parcels for 44 people on Monday when it had identified 129 people in the borough who needed emergency food aid. The government has organised for some deliveries to be made direct to those who have been told to self-isolate, leaving the division of responsibilities confused, local authorities say. The food supplied to Rochdale for households was mostly made up of empty calories and included a giant bottle of sweetened fruit squash, a bag of sugar, teabags, confectionery, small individually wrapped gingerbread biscuits, egg noodles, hard-to-split catering size packs of Angel Delight dessert mix, and just one apple per person. Inventories seen by the Guardian of what was delivered to some other councils over the last few days list similar items of very low nutritional value, including tins of creamed rice, long-life sweetened custard, and, as in Rochdale, giant bottles of fruit squash. Some have also received a small number of longlife ""one meal"" portions of ready meals such as sausages and mash. One council told us that the only fresh fruit or vegetables on its list of what would be supplied were a limited number of apples, but these did not in fact get delivered. The government promised the packages would contain essential food and household items for those with underlying health problems who need to self-isolate at home for 12 weeks and have no family or friends to help them. The communities secretary, Robert Jenrick, appeared on television news over the weekend helping deliver food boxes to houses with vulnerable people. Rochdale council's Labour leader, Allen Brett, called on the government yesterday to improve the quality of its parcels: Everyone appreciates that this is an unprecedented situation but the parcels that have been provided were not of the quality we were expecting. Thankfully our council officers are able to source food locally and add them to the packs to ensure that those receiving them have a better choice of items.He told the Guardian that after he went public with his concerns he received a call late last night from the secretary of state's office accusing him of putting out false information. A council spokesman said: We do not recognise the secretary of state's description of these packages being additional supplies to kick-start wider efforts as they were linked directly to our shielded residents. While we are pleased to hear reports that packages sent directly to homes were of a higher standard, we also note that other councils have expressed concerns about the quality of the initial packages they received from government.Referring food items sent out in Rochdale, a government spokesperson said: This picture is misleading, it is not one of the food boxes we are delivering directly to the homes of extremely medically vulnerable people.Our food boxes are of a standard that is consistent and include cereal, fruit and vegetables and pasta. As much as possible, this is a package that is universally suitable, and will provide enough food for one person for one week.Councils have been issued with some additional supplies to help kickstart their wider efforts - but these should not be confused for a food box.Updated at 5.07pm BST3.59pm BSTTwo behavioural scientists have written to Chris Whitty, the chief medical officer for England, to warn about the potential unintended consequences of mass public testing for coronavirus infection.Prof Madelynne Arden at Sheffield Hallam University and Prof Christopher Armitage at the University of Manchester have told Whitty they felt compelled to share their concerns about the likely impact of mass testing on the public's adherence to the lockdown and social distancing measures.The scientists believe that people who have had the virus will return to normal life, since they will are likely to have some immunity, but warn this could encourage everyone else to follow suit. Another concern is that people who are fed up with isolation will be out and about and simply claim to have had the infection.They write:Making tests easily available in the community could therefore have detrimental effects on public social isolation and therefore on the spread and containment of Covid-19. We therefore urge careful planning on how this testing will be managed to avoid the problems outlined.Updated at 4.13pm BST3.44pm BSTDeath toll in UK hospitals rises by 381 to 1,789A total of 1,789 patients have died in hospital after testing positive for coronavirus in the UK as of 5pm on Monday, the Department of Health said, up by 381 from 1,408 the day before.

He said he was lucky to have seen Machu Picchu, the 15th-century Incan citadel, during his month-long stay in the country since many others had arrived in Peru only to be forced to almost immediately make plans to leave after the sudden imposition of curfews and restrictions on movement.More than 1,000 Britons had registered with the UK embassy in Peru for assistance in returning home due to a near total absence of commercial flights and McNamee was one of about 200 on the first repatriation flight out of the country.He said:The staff were really upbeat on the flight and kept our spirits up. It was a full plane with no social distancing but the priority was to get people out. I'm so glad to be home.McNamee criticised the Foreign Office for a lack of help and advertising an Avianca flight for $3,000 to the UK - several times in excess of the normal fare - but he thanked the government for facilitating his return.At first the Foreign Office support was appalling. We got no communication at all since the embassy had just closed in Lima. But they did sort it out a bit and put the flight on in the end and we got out. They did deliver eventually but it probably could have been sooner.He explained that Lima had been tense, with armed guards strictly enforcing the lockdown, but he was just glad to have been in the capital - with many more Britons remaining stranded in more remote areas of Peru.All we kept hearing was the lockdown getting stricter and stricter. At first we could all go out for food, but then you just had to send just one person and had to prove you were going for food. There were armed guards everywhere and no one spoke any English. It felt like it was a bit indefinite and that we had to get out.

A spokesman said Johnson's symptoms remained mild and he was following the UK guidelines by self-isolating for seven days.Allin-Khan, however, has said that the PM should double his isolation to 14 days in line with World Health Organization guidance and that the UK should change its advice accordingly.

Researchers found that mentally stimulating activities can significantly lower the risk of developing the condition.People who read a daily newspaper, pursue a hobby and engage in cultural activities had a 26 per cent lower likelihood of dementia than those who did not.Once other factors associated with a lower risk of developing dementia were taken into account, such as wealth, being married or in a relationship, not smoking and being in good physical health, the risk dropped to 40 per cent.A study concluded that intellectually focused leisure activities and light physical exercise helped to build up a cognitive reserve that can mitigate the symptoms of neurodegenerative disorders.People who had a professional career or a mentally challenging job had higher levels of cognitive reserve as did those educated to degree level.The study, by behavioural scientists at University College London, monitored data from 12,280 adults aged 50 and older over 15 years. The results were published in the                    British Journal of Psychiatry                   .Participants were grouped according to leisure interests, based on questions about whether and how often they took part in 16 different activities, and also by occupation and education.The authors said it was the first study to look at the overall effect of cognitive reserve at staving off dementia and the factors that contribute to it in a large representative sample of the English population. All participants were free of dementia at the start but over the time studied 602 developed the condition.The senior author, Dorina Cadar, senior research fellow at UCL's department of behavioural science, said: ""In times of confinement like now you still can do things to [stimulate] your brain. The more you are engaged and mentally stimulated and also socially connected . . . it is protective so it is just not one single benefit but the multifactoral aspect of having rich leisure activities.""",Newspaper; Web Publication
253,"How coronavirus can be stopped in eight weeks;As the US becomes the centre of the pandemic and health services globally brace for disaster, former World Health Organisation director Anthony Costello tells Nafeez Ahmed that it is not too late to regain control of the situation","March 31, 2020 Tuesday",International,The Independent (United Kingdom),2620,2620,England & Wales,NAFEEZ AHMED,"How coronavirus can be stopped in eight weeksAs the US becomes the centre of the pandemic and health services globally brace for disaster, former World Health Organisation director Anthony Costello tells Nafeez Ahmed that it is not too late to regain control of the situation","""We know we can get this under control,"" says Dr Anthony Costello, a former director at the World Health Organisation (WHO) where he headed up maternal, child and adolescent health. ""The problem is that Europe has been too slow to act compared with Asia; and America is now facing a huge crisis.""Costello, who is professor of global health at University College London, where he also previously headed up the UCL Institute for Global Health, spoke to me via telephone from Yorkshire, where he is currently isolating from his family, many of whom are experiencing symptoms of the novel coronavirus.Costello, who joined the WHO from 2015 to 2018 before returning to UCL, pulls no punches about the failures that, he says, have allowed the new coronavirus to rampage across western countries.""America is now the epicentre of the pandemic,""he warns, arguing that the United States may experience the highest rate of fatalities anywhere in the world. London, too, he tells me, ""will face a health service disaster within two to three weeks, because it's been allowed to let rip there. I really fear for our people and my health colleagues.""The reason the US and UK are on track for disaster is due to the failure to take early action, Costello explains. This allowed the virus to spread undetected among communities for as long as two months, setting us up for levels of exponential growth which are now bound to overwhelm healthcare facilities.But he insists it's not yet too late to regain control of the situation. And the data suggests we could do it in as little as seven to eight weeks.""We know that the virus has been circulating in the US at least since mid-January, when a guy flew into Seattle from Wuhan. He seems to have seeded the virus, and since then we have had exponential community transmission,"" Costello says.The Trump administration, however, rapidly changed course on its previous inaction after White House officials read a paper released on 16 March by Imperial College London's Covid-19 Response Team.That paper, produced by the same scientists advising Boris Johnson's government in the UK, used a mathematical model to estimate the consequences of the US and British government's prior strategies of minimalist mitigation.The findings were frightening, forecasting that as many as 1.1 million Americans and 260,000 Britons would die even if more ambitious measures were pursued to slow the epidemic. The only way to avoid this outcome, the Imperial College team recommended, is a comprehensive epidemic suppression strategy enforcing social distancing for 18 months - until a vaccine becomes available.Since then, the US Centres for Disease Control hasadopted the 18-month suppression strategy as part of their official response plan. Meanwhile, Donald Trump has already expressed his reluctance to pursue such a protracted lockdown due to its impact on the global economy.Seemingly vindicating his approach was a separate model produced by Oxford University which made national headlines, claiming that as much as 50 per cent of the British population may have already been infected and built up ""herd immunity"" to the virus - implying that social restrictions could be lifted far more quickly.The study was also amplified by conservative commentators in the US, who suggested that it meantthe US lockdown policy should be ended.But according to Costello, ""both these mathematical models cannot be right. I suspect that the truth might in fact be somewhere in the middle.""WhileImperial College London's modelling of the potential high fatality rate of a ""do nothing""approach has been widely accepted by the scientific community, its 18-month solution strategy has been questioned - as has the Oxford model's opposite approach assuming a buildup of immunity.A study by the New England Complex Systems Institute at New York University found that the Imperial Collegescientists had ignored data from east Asia demonstrating the efficacy of mass testing and contact tracing in suppressing the outbreak and minimising fatalities within around fiveweeks. Epidemiologists and public health experts had also pointed out that the Oxford paper's optimistic modelling was already contradicted by fatality data from Italy. And neither model has supported the best tried-and-tested responses to dealing with an epidemic.As a result, says Costello, the ""United States is now the epicentre of the pandemic. Currently, Britain is a bit ahead of the US, and two and half weeks behind Italy, which is only a few days ahead of Spain, France and Germany.""But the problem is that government has placed the modellers in the forefront of decision-making. SAGE [the UK government's Scientific Advisory Group on Emergencies] strikes me as having downplayed the public health view. Which is that you've got to act fast, find the virus, test test test, trace the contacts of those who are infected, isolate and quarantine, and implement strong social distancing. You do all that and what we've seen in east Asia is that you can really contain this, suppress this within seven weeks.""This won't make the virus simply disappear but it buys valuable time and drives down the death rate. According to Costello, while there is nothing wrong with bringing in theoretical experts to do mathematical national modelling, the real problem is that the British government's scientific experts lack significant experience in staving off real-world epidemics.""They are all good academics. I have a great deal of respect for them. But none of them have successfully managed a public health crisis like this. The Imperial College paper, for instance, didn't model the impact of mass testing, and talked only about case isolation. Yet these are precisely the tactics that we know work so well. Mass testing for the virus is already working in places like South Korea, where they've managed to find a way to keep this at bay without draconian lockdowns.""Costello is sceptical of the official claim that the reason we didn't rapidly bring in mass testing is the lack of capacity.He cites virologist Professor Julian Peto of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine who, Costello tells me, has ""rightly rubbished the idea that we don't have the capacity for testing. Just one real-time PCR machine can be used to undertake as many as 10,000 tests over two weeks. All we would have needed to do was ramp this up, mobilising local research labs around the country to reach hundreds of thousands, if not millions. We haven't done this, and the question is, why?""We knew at the end of January that a crisis was developing in Wuhan, and any crisis management team would ask, is there a chance it could come to London, or Washington. And the answer at that time from public health experts was simple: yes. We should have started preparing for the worse case scenario. We didn't.""There is still time to get ahead of the crisis, Costello says. ""We have London surging. Many parts of the US are similarly surging. In the UK we also have the West Midlands and some other areas. But there are other places where we don't really know what's going on, because we just aren't doing much community testing. Testing of health workers is essential, but without community testing we can't see what's going on, we can't tell how the epidemic is spreading. It's being able to tell that which allows us to move in rapidly to isolate cases, and this is the key to being able to slowly return to some degree of normalcy.""After announcing the end of the community testing earlier in March, the government U-turned and declared it would ramp up community testing, with Johnson promising 25,000 tests a day. But it still hasn't happened. ""Community virus testing hasn't properly kicked off. We are still doing a maximum of around 5,000 tests a day. This is way too low.""Costello is also concerned about tepid government messaging. ""It's not enough to just have modellers, virologists, and behavioural scientists. You need people who can translate this into action. Social scientists. Public health experts experienced in community mobilisation. Right now we are locked into this strange idea that the prime minister or president makes a speech and suddenly the entire country changes its mind. That's just a fantasy. Throughout my career I've seen that just giving people a few of the right messages won't necessarily change behaviour. We need a more serious decentralised approach and to share data with local communities.""He refers to some of China's mass communications measures. ""The Chinese managed to suppress the virus in provinces outside Wuhan without the same sort of total lockdown by operating quickly. They had a TV station giving out information on the virus round-the-clock on a 24-hour basis. We had policing of supermarkets and pharmacies. But most importantly we had a comprehensive mass testing and contact tracing programme. And proper protection for frontline health workers. And that's how this was brought under control within sevenweeks.""In contrast, Costello warns that the situation facing frontline health workers in the US and UK is nothing short of disastrous. ""We simply don't have enough PPE [personal protective equipment]. Not enough visors, not enough N95 respirators. Government is not following WHO guidelines.""I saw this first-hand when I had to call the emergency services to come and see to my 75-year-old father. He has dementia, diabetes, heart disease and has had multiple strokes. Earlier this week, he tested positive for Covid-19. He is currently in a stable condition in a London hospital. When the paramedics arrived, they wore little more than surgical masks - known to be largely useless in repelling coronaviruses - and thin bibs made out of what looked like the same material as plastic bags. It's quite possible, if not likely, that they were infected as a result of handling my father - and that they may, in turn, be infecting others whom they deal with during the course of their jobs. But while I've been advised to self-isolate after my own contact with my father, no one has told these frontline workers to do the same, and they haven't been tested - the government only announced a ramp-up of testing for healthcare staff at the end of March.Costello welcomes the measure, but is clear that it is far from sufficient. While the US government has continued to dither on testing, the UK government has announced plans to make test kits available to millions. ""I'm worried about the immune response tests they are bringing in. These tests might only become positive a week or two after infection. So they are not a good diagnostic test for active infection. If a health worker tests negative and, reassured, goes back to work they might be actively infectious.""Further, there is no central coordination for the testing. Costello thinks immune tests will give useful population information but may not give data to authorities which they can use to systematically trace contacts, isolate cases, and contain outbreaks.He points out that in east Asia - Singapore, Taiwan, Hong Kong and beyond - while there have been new outbreaks, their coordinated mass test-trace suppression strategies have proven that a huge resurgence of Covid-19 is not necessarily inevitable. The approach means that when outbreaks do reoccur, they can be more effectively contained.But what about the resurgence of cases, I wonder, occurring in Hong Kong, South Korea and other places? Hong Kong, for instance has had to resort to stronger lockdowns to suppress a sudden upsurge in new cases as restrictions were relaxed.Costello points out that their success in minimalising fatalities, and their capacity to move fast to identify and isolate outbreaks, puts them in a better position to respond.""We are playing for time,""says Costello. And it's in that that we can learn more about the virus. ""We don't know yet how many asymptomatic people are being infected and building immunity. With these people identified they can get back to work. We don't know how much herd immunity has been created. The more we learn, the more we can get our economy going a bit more with careful monitoring for outbreaks. And we don't know when a vaccine will arrive.""What does the next 18 months look like then? In Costello's view, with the right strategy, it doesn't need to be a permanent, full-scale lockdown - but this can only be achieved with a nimble, adaptive approach based on the interplay between mass testing, tracing and isolation, and the data that can be developed from doing so.""The strategy is to firstly get suppression as in China, South Korea, Hong Kong and so on, which takes about two months. And to save lives and not overwhelm the health services in this first phase. Secondly, this buys time to explore other medium strategies for loosening thelockdown, depending upon the data on immunity and ways to get the economy moving. Thirdly, you get a safe vaccine.""I ask Costello about the herd immunitycontroversy. Is it possible that we might develop sufficient levels of immunity in the population that preventthe disease from being a problem? Is that how we will eventually beat this? Or are we doomed to have this virus surge back every time we relax restrictions?In the long run, he told me, it might be possible that populations do eventually build up immunity to the virus.""The general idea that we might eventually build up herd immunity has a certain plausibility in the sense that lots of viruses spread around and a lot of people get sub-clinical infections, and immunity can build up that way. It's a phenomenon that's well known. We know well that when most of the population are infected and asymptomatic, this can happen. My view is that the truth of what's in store may lie somewhere in between the Oxford and Imperial models. The bottom line is that we don't know the quality of that immunity that we get after recovering from this coronavirus, and how long it will last. Virologists say that generally we don't get long-lasting immunity from coronaviruses. We might also get new strains due to mutations. So even if lots of people have been exposed, we don't know the quality of the immunity, there may still be a second surge. There are all sorts of unknowns.""Costello comes back to the importance of coordinated testing. ""We need to go out and do mass testing for the virus in communities. This tells us who has it, and where. That information can be given back to communities so authorities and citizens know what's happening in their area. Whether it's a nasal swab or an antibody test, we need to do this so that we can base our strategies on actual data. We can only go so far with theoretical models.""Herd immunity or not, Costello is clear that it is a huge mistake to simply let the virus run. The biggest danger is that if the virus is allowed to simply spread without controls - as it had been for nearly two months - the overwhelming impact on healthcare facilities due to the sheer number of cases requiring hospitalisation could drive fatality rates much higher than anticipated, as is happening in Italy. The model's warning of the risk of millions of deaths in such a scenario are, Costello says, very possible.""If I was advising the government, I would give people a more feasible lockdown period as long as we are very strict. That, as in Asia, we can get this under control in about two months. Even Wuhan is starting to open up. My fear is that we will now have a longer lead time to achieve this, because we have already let it run. But if we focus on an eight-week challenge, with mass testing to inform a systematic approach to tracing and isolating, we may not need an 18-month lockdown.""",Newspaper

Mass testing for the virus is already working in places like South Korea, where they've managed to find a way to keep this at bay without draconian lockdowns.""Costello is sceptical of the official claim that the reason we didn't rapidly bring in mass testing is the lack of capacity.He cites virologist Professor Julian Peto of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine who, Costello tells me, has ""rightly rubbished the idea that we don't have the capacity for testing. Just one real-time PCR machine can be used to undertake as many as 10,000 tests over two weeks. All we would have needed to do was ramp this up, mobilising local research labs around the country to reach hundreds of thousands, if not millions. We haven't done this, and the question is, why?""We knew at the end of January that a crisis was developing in Wuhan, and any crisis management team would ask, is there a chance it could come to London, or Washington. And the answer at that time from public health experts was simple: yes. We should have started preparing for the worse case scenario. We didn't.""There is still time to get ahead of the crisis, Costello says. ""We have London surging. Many parts of the US are similarly surging. In the UK we also have the West Midlands and some other areas. But there are other places where we don't really know what's going on, because we just aren't doing much community testing. Testing of health workers is essential, but without community testing we can't see what's going on, we can't tell how the epidemic is spreading. It's being able to tell that which allows us to move in rapidly to isolate cases, and this is the key to being able to slowly return to some degree of normalcy.""After announcing the end of the community testing earlier in March, the government U-turned and declared it would ramp up community testing, with Johnson promising 25,000 tests a day. But it still hasn't happened. ""Community virus testing hasn't properly kicked off. We are still doing a maximum of around 5,000 tests a day. This is way too low.""Costello is also concerned about tepid government messaging. ""It's not enough to just have modellers, virologists, and behavioural scientists. You need people who can translate this into action. Social scientists. Public health experts experienced in community mobilisation. Right now we are locked into this strange idea that the prime minister or president makes a speech and suddenly the entire country changes its mind. That's just a fantasy. Throughout my career I've seen that just giving people a few of the right messages won't necessarily change behaviour. We need a more serious decentralised approach and to share data with local communities.""He refers to some of China's mass communications measures. ""The Chinese managed to suppress the virus in provinces outside Wuhan without the same sort of total lockdown by operating quickly. They had a TV station giving out information on the virus round-the-clock on a 24-hour basis. We had policing of supermarkets and pharmacies. But most importantly we had a comprehensive mass testing and contact tracing programme. And proper protection for frontline health workers. And that's how this was brought under control within sevenweeks.""In contrast, Costello warns that the situation facing frontline health workers in the US and UK is nothing short of disastrous. ""We simply don't have enough PPE [personal protective equipment]. Not enough visors, not enough N95 respirators. Government is not following WHO guidelines.""I saw this first-hand when I had to call the emergency services to come and see to my 75-year-old father. He has dementia, diabetes, heart disease and has had multiple strokes. Earlier this week, he tested positive for Covid-19. He is currently in a stable condition in a London hospital. When the paramedics arrived, they wore little more than surgical masks - known to be largely useless in repelling coronaviruses - and thin bibs made out of what looked like the same material as plastic bags. It's quite possible, if not likely, that they were infected as a result of handling my father - and that they may, in turn, be infecting others whom they deal with during the course of their jobs. But while I've been advised to self-isolate after my own contact with my father, no one has told these frontline workers to do the same, and they haven't been tested - the government only announced a ramp-up of testing for healthcare staff at the end of March.Costello welcomes the measure, but is clear that it is far from sufficient. While the US government has continued to dither on testing, the UK government has announced plans to make test kits available to millions. ""I'm worried about the immune response tests they are bringing in. These tests might only become positive a week or two after infection. So they are not a good diagnostic test for active infection. If a health worker tests negative and, reassured, goes back to work they might be actively infectious.""Further, there is no central coordination for the testing. Costello thinks immune tests will give useful population information but may not give data to authorities which they can use to systematically trace contacts, isolate cases, and contain outbreaks.He points out that in east Asia - Singapore, Taiwan, Hong Kong and beyond - while there have been new outbreaks, their coordinated mass test-trace suppression strategies have proven that a huge resurgence of Covid-19 is not necessarily inevitable. The approach means that when outbreaks do reoccur, they can be more effectively contained.But what about the resurgence of cases, I wonder, occurring in Hong Kong, South Korea and other places? Hong Kong, for instance has had to resort to stronger lockdowns to suppress a sudden upsurge in new cases as restrictions were relaxed.Costello points out that their success in minimalising fatalities, and their capacity to move fast to identify and isolate outbreaks, puts them in a better position to respond.""We are playing for time,""says Costello. And it's in that that we can learn more about the virus. ""We don't know yet how many asymptomatic people are being infected and building immunity. With these people identified they can get back to work. We don't know how much herd immunity has been created. The more we learn, the more we can get our economy going a bit more with careful monitoring for outbreaks. And we don't know when a vaccine will arrive.""What does the next 18 months look like then? In Costello's view, with the right strategy, it doesn't need to be a permanent, full-scale lockdown - but this can only be achieved with a nimble, adaptive approach based on the interplay between mass testing, tracing and isolation, and the data that can be developed from doing so.""The strategy is to firstly get suppression as in China, South Korea, Hong Kong and so on, which takes about two months. And to save lives and not overwhelm the health services in this first phase. Secondly, this buys time to explore other medium strategies for loosening thelockdown, depending upon the data on immunity and ways to get the economy moving. Thirdly, you get a safe vaccine.""I ask Costello about the herd immunitycontroversy. Is it possible that we might develop sufficient levels of immunity in the population that preventthe disease from being a problem? Is that how we will eventually beat this? Or are we doomed to have this virus surge back every time we relax restrictions?In the long run, he told me, it might be possible that populations do eventually build up immunity to the virus.""The general idea that we might eventually build up herd immunity has a certain plausibility in the sense that lots of viruses spread around and a lot of people get sub-clinical infections, and immunity can build up that way. It's a phenomenon that's well known. We know well that when most of the population are infected and asymptomatic, this can happen. My view is that the truth of what's in store may lie somewhere in between the Oxford and Imperial models. The bottom line is that we don't know the quality of that immunity that we get after recovering from this coronavirus, and how long it will last. Virologists say that generally we don't get long-lasting immunity from coronaviruses. We might also get new strains due to mutations. So even if lots of people have been exposed, we don't know the quality of the immunity, there may still be a second surge. There are all sorts of unknowns.""Costello comes back to the importance of coordinated testing. ""We need to go out and do mass testing for the virus in communities. This tells us who has it, and where. That information can be given back to communities so authorities and citizens know what's happening in their area. Whether it's a nasal swab or an antibody test, we need to do this so that we can base our strategies on actual data. We can only go so far with theoretical models.""Herd immunity or not, Costello is clear that it is a huge mistake to simply let the virus run. The biggest danger is that if the virus is allowed to simply spread without controls - as it had been for nearly two months - the overwhelming impact on healthcare facilities due to the sheer number of cases requiring hospitalisation could drive fatality rates much higher than anticipated, as is happening in Italy. The model's warning of the risk of millions of deaths in such a scenario are, Costello says, very possible.""If I was advising the government, I would give people a more feasible lockdown period as long as we are very strict. That, as in Asia, we can get this under control in about two months. Even Wuhan is starting to open up. My fear is that we will now have a longer lead time to achieve this, because we have already let it run. But if we focus on an eight-week challenge, with mass testing to inform a systematic approach to tracing and isolating, we may not need an 18-month lockdown.""",Newspaper
255,DON'T LET YOURSELF CATCH ANXIETY TOO!,"March 31, 2020 Tuesday",International,The Daily Mail and Mail on Sunday (London),2418,2418,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,,DON'T LET YOURSELF CATCH ANXIETY TOO!,"Of course we're worried about getting the virus. But being trapped at home can also cause panic and depression. Here, our experts reveal the best ways to keep yourself mentally healthy...BY JOHN NAISHThrow out those tea towels and mugs bearing the famous wartime slogan Keep Calm and Carry On for leading British mental health experts warn that trying to stay cheerily in denial about the huge stresses of life in coronavirus isolation may be one of the worst things that we can do.Instead, they believe that if we are to emerge from isolation healthily, we must acknowledge the strains we are under and adopt active strategies to foster and protect our mental health. Our new motto should be: Stay Home and Do Everything To Stay Sane.Professor Sir Simon Wessely, one of the UK's top authorities on traumatic stress, is fully aware of the tribulations involved. He recently emerged from 14 days' self-isolation after his wife, Clare Gerada, the former chair of the Royal College of GPs, contracted coronavirus during a trip to New York (as she told Good Health earlier this month).Sir Simon, who is a professor of psychological medicine at the Institute of Psychiatry, King's College London, and president of the Royal College of Psychiatrists, told Good Health: We have to recognise the fact that self-isolation is difficult.Luckily, my wife recovered quickly and I remain well. It was stressful enough for us, even though we have a nice house with two bathrooms.'Of course, the stresses for families cooped up together in smaller homes, or people isolated alone, can be exponentially worse while such problems are only exacerbated by the fact that we're in the middle of a contagion of anxiety, as well as a viral pandemic.Numerous studies have shown how we can catch anxiety from others. For example, Michigan University psychologists have found the phenomenon in college roommates. In the journal Health Economics in 2013, they reported that people sharing with anxious students subsequently saw their own anxiety levels rise.Other studies have found that anxious teachers spark higher anxiety in their pupils, and that siblings are particularly effective at passing stress to each other.This happens online as well as in self-isolating families.In 2017, psychologists at Arkansas State University who studied more than 240 undergraduates warned in The Journal of Psychology & the Behavioral Sciences that sites such as Facebook can rapidly spread anxiety and depression through communities by people posting stories about feeling badly stressed.Stress contagion is already emerging across Britain, says Professor Wessely. We know from public polls that levels of anxiety are rising in the population as a result of the pandemic.It's normal and healthy to be anxious,' he says. We mustn't go telling people to calm down.It's important to say that anxiety is not a mental disorder but rather a rational response to a scary situation.'Professor Wessely says that UK authorities recently feared that Britons were keeping too calm about coronavirus: We were worried that people weren't anxious enough to make them cooperate with the lockdown measures required to reduce the coronavirus's spread.'The Government's reluctance to impose a lockdown had been much criticised but David Hunter, a professor of epidemiology and medicine at the University of Oxford, argues that if the lockdown were imposed too soon, the public would get fed up of life in quarantine and rebel.In the New England Journal of Medicine last week, he wrote: Legitimate concerns about the adverse effects of social distancing on some older people's sense of isolation, loneliness and healthcare access led to an argument that social distancing should be delayed as long as possible.'Now we are all stuck with it for the duration.The more positive news is that the British populace has, in the past, proved far more resilient than psychologists predicted.There was absolute consensus at the start of World War II that after one bad night of bombing, the population would flee from the cities and we would lose the war,' says Professor Wessely. But it didn't happen. In the vast majority of cases, people got used to the new reality very quickly.'The big difference now is that people in World War II were not isolated. Instead, the wartime authorities encouraged social intimacy, keeping cafes, pubs and clubs open.Studies of quarantine show that it increases anxiety-related mental health problems, such as clinical depression, and increases symptoms of obsessive compulsive disorder in people who suffer it,' says Professor Wessely.The study data we have is cheering about resilience. But there is a limit to how much pain a society can stand. We wonder for how long people will go along with this. Hopefully, we will be able to have periodic breaks from lockdown.'When will those breaks come?It's best for the authorities not to hazard guesses, says Professor Wessely. The most crucial thing is not to give people false reassurance. If you give people a date and don't stick to it, you get more mental health problems breaking out because they lose crucial trust in what they are being told.'So we're in for a long haul and that's all we know. Meanwhile, here is what experts tell Good Health we should do to keep ourselves mentally healthy.BE POSITIVE ABOUT ANXIETYDr Sally Austen, a consultant clinical psychologist based in Birmingham, says: It is perfectly OK to be frightened. This is a scary time.Anxiety is survival. Without it we would die by cuddling lions that look cute, or juggling with knives. We don't want to switch off our  anxiety altogether, as our anxiety is useful in guiding us. So don't try to squash it with excess alcohol or drugs.Let it warn you to wash your hands and to follow government health advice. Let it remind you to call your loved ones. But notice when you are feeling overloaded and need to do something else.'Dr Austen suggests that when we feel overwhelmed, we should do something physical such as cleaning cupboards, chopping wood or doing some press-ups.Last year, a report in the journal Anxiety & Depression found that people with anxiety disorders who reported high-level physical activity were better protected against developing anxiety symptoms than those who reported low physical activity.It is believed that exercise helps through releasing feel-good' endorphins which counteract anxious feelings, while also reducing levels of the body's stress hormones, such as adrenaline.Exercise may also shift people's focus away from their worries.And getting outside into nature is a proven stress-reducer. A Harvard University report earlier this month in the journal Environment International, for example, studied 100 people and found that even periods of just six minutes in natural surroundings reduced their anxiety levels significantly.The biophilia hypothesis argues that we find nature stress-relieving because it is the environment in which we spent long millennia evolving.STAY CLOSE TO THOSE YOU LOVEStudies of people swept up in disasters show that they are least traumatised if they are able to keep in touch with their nearest and dearest.A 2017 report in The BMJ on the consequences of the July 7 London terror attacks, for example, found that: Fears and anxieties among the general public were largely managed by people turning to their existing social networks.For most people, social support from family, friends, colleagues or other members of their social network is associated with good mental health.'It added: Evidence suggests that when disaster strikes, people are often more concerned about loved ones than themselves.Being unable to contact loved ones after a trauma is associated with higher anxiety, not only in the short term, but also for up to six months later.'MAKE the MOST OF SOCIAL MEDIAProfessor Wessely says it is important now to activate your social networks. They can be key to fostering connectedness with people of your choice when you want to,' he says.Social media is merely a tool in your armoury, to be used well or poorly. The same 2017 Arkansas University study which found Facebook can increase personal anxiety and depression also reported that it is more likely to increase happiness and good mood through sharing positivity and social support.Dr Lisa Orchard, an expert in cyberpsychology at the University of Wolverhampton, says using social media actively such as organising virtual meet-ups with friends and family rather than passively just reading posts you see, is better for mental health.These needn't be limited to chatting,' she says. Friends and family can take part in group activities such as watching films or cooking together virtually.'TALK openly with CHILDRENCommunicating feelings with your children is essential. You need to do it as positively as possible, rather than just transferring your anxiety on to them, says Andrea Chatten, a children's emotional and behavioural psychologist based in Sheffield.A good way to start is to ask them what they know about the situation, and how they think other children might be feeling,' she says. Ask them how they are finding the situation and tell them how you are feeling about it.When adults share their feelings (without catastrophising, of course) they can really benefit youngsters by teaching them to name their feelings and develop some mastery over them. If you fail to acknowledge feelings of anxiety, your brain may keep ramping them up and force you to notice them.'DON'T PRESS THE PANIC ButtonWe don't see any evidence of panic in Britain,' says Professor Wessely. And I want to shoot anyone who talks of “panic buying”. We've been telling people to prepare for isolation, so it's perfectly understandable that they will stock up on necessities.It is also very wrong to tell people not to panic. First, because those who are already panicking are unlikely to listen. Second, those who aren't will start to wonder if they should. But, most importantly, we know that during emergencies, most people don't panic for most of the time.'Try finding fun in the ordinaryFun is crucial, says Andrea Chatten. This lockdown period is an opportunity for people to play games together, such as board games, or to do play that doesn't immediately look like play, such as planting a vegetable patch in the garden, organising photo albums or starting an online course.'She adds: We can either fight the situation, hold on to all our negative feelings and stay miserable or accept the reality and put our emotional energy into doing things that will make us feel happier and better.'volunteer TO HELP OTHERSOne of the best ways to get Britain through this period of lockdown is to help each other by doing things such as shopping for the elderly, says Professor Wessely.The thing to do is encourage lots of altruistic behaviour, with people helping each other in communities, and this is what we are currently seeing.'Such behaviour is believed to boost volunteers' morale as much as the people who are helped.The idea that doing good benefits the doer seems as old as philosophy itself. Socrates, the Greek philosopher considered the father of Western philosophy, argued that the virtuous person is a joyful person. His student, Plato, even calculated that the charitable man is 729 times more joyful than the unvirtuous.More scientifically, several studies have found that people who volunteer to help others tend to live significantly longer than people who do no volunteer work.A POST-LOCKDOWN version of YOUThis period of unheralded inactivity can be used as a way of piloting positive changes, says Andrea Chatten.We should harness the time and space as an opportunity to learn about ourselves, what we value, and what we might want more or less of when we have our liberty back,' she says.For example, perhaps you might want to work at home more and commute less in future.While we may miss the adrenaline that we are used to rushing about with, slowing down could do us all more good than we realise and, hopefully, improve things for the longer term.'Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a common danger in periods of lockdown, according to a review by Dr Samantha Brooks, a psychiatrist at King's College London.Specific causes of stress include longer quarantine duration, fear of infection, frustration, boredom, lack of adequate supplies, inadequate information and financial loss, said the report in The Lancet last month.Symptoms of PTSD include re-experiencing the trauma through intrusive, distressing recollections of the event, flashbacks and nightmares.Sufferers may also experience emotional numbness and avoidance of places, people and activities that are reminders of the trauma.The risk of PTSD is particularly high when people suffer persistent worry about coronavirus infection, says Sir Simon Wessely, a professor of psychological medicine at King's College London and president of the Royal College of Psychiatrists.PTSD symptoms particularly increase when you have been dogged by fears of infecting your family or being infected,' he says.In adults, PTSD symptoms can prove extremely persistent. In 2009, researchers reported in the Canadian Journal of Psychiatry how being quarantined was a predictor of PTSD in hospital employees as long as three years later.Children and adolescents are at risk of PTSD, too. A report by Kentucky University in 2013, for example, concluded that lockdowns can quadruple children's risk of PTSD.There is little research on what can be done to allay quarantine-related PTSD. Reminding yourself of the reasons for the lockdown, why they are not your fault, and that the situation is not threatening may help, reported The Lancet. So may all of the strategies outlined on this page.Considering others may also protect against PTSD.Enrico Zanalda, president of the Italian Society of Psychiatry, says Italy's experience demonstrates that: Appeals to altruism by reminding the public about the benefits of quarantine to wider society can be favourable.'David Smithson, operations director of the charity Anxiety UK, recommends that whenever people feel overwhelmed by stress, they focus on the acronym APPLE . . .Acknowledge the fearful uncertainty and be mindful of it, rather than being gripped by it.Pause, rather than reacting fearfully to your feelings.Pull back, away from all of your worries.Let go of the thought or feeling.Explore the present moment and shift your attention to something non-stressful.© Daily Mail",Papers

260,Derbyshire police chief defends force's reaction to lockdown;Supreme court judge Lord Sumption said force's use of drones reminiscent of a police stateCoronavirus - latest updatesSee all our coronavirus coverage,"March 31, 2020 Tuesday",International,The Guardian (London),663,663,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,Vikram Dodd and Owen Bowcott,Derbyshire police chief defends force's reaction to lockdownSupreme court judge Lord Sumption said force's use of drones reminiscent of a police stateCoronavirus - latest updatesSee all our coronavirus coverage,"The Derbyshire chief constable whose force was described as ""disgraceful"" by a former supreme court judge has defended the behaviour of his officers and said other areas were being more draconian in the enforcement of the coronavirus lockdown.Ch Con Peter Goodman, said the emergency laws were unclear and argued the use of police drones to highlight people exercising on a seemingly empty Peak Districtwas meant to start a conversation.He used a series of media interviews to point out his officers had yet to issue a fine, a summons or make an arrest.He reacted after Derbyshire constabulary was singled out by Lord Sumption, who described the use of the drones as ""disgraceful"" and reminiscent of a police state.Goodman told the Derby Telegraph: ""The new legislation is not absolutely clear. We have been highlighted because of the slightly unusual use of drones.""But there are some forces who have implemented more draconian measures. Some have implemented roadblocks. We are not doing that and we do not intend to do that.""By Monday, the Lancashire force had issued 123 fines under the emergency powers, which came in last Thursday and outlawed non-essential shops staying open, two or more people gathering and tried to get people to stay in their homes with limited exceptions.Forces such as Bedfordshire, Durham, Hampshire, Leicestershire, Lincolnshire, Northamptonshire, Suffolk, West Midlands, Wiltshire as well as Derbyshire are yet to use the enforcement powers.Derbyshire's police and crime commissioner, Hardyal Dhindsa, told the Guardian he defended the force's actions to bolster physical distancing. ""Derbyshire police have been applauded and the majority of the public have been very cooperative, understanding and supportive,"" he said.Some other forces are using nudge theory to encourage people to comply, pointing out how many already are rather than highlighting problems.In a video message, teh Greater Manchester police chief constable, Ian Hopkins, thanked the public for a ""huge"" drop in numbers on the streets.He also accepted mistakes had been made implementing the radical and sweeping emergency laws: ""Our policy is engage, encourage, explain and lastly enforcement. There will be individual officers who will get that wrong and we are working very hard for consistency.""Policing by consent is important and we can only make all of this work with the consent of the public. I want to thank the vast majority of you that are sensibly following the guidance.""Police chiefs want to achieve greater consistency across forces with an expectation the lockdown will last considerably beyond the three weeks initially announced by the prime minister last Monday.There are concerns about public tolerance as the lockdown continues and the weather warms up.Gracie Mae Bradley, the policy and campaigns manager at the human rights organisation Liberty, said the different interpretations by different forces meant people did not know how to observe the laws.""Despite the broad scope of these powers, we've seen various incidents of police going even further - and beyond their lawful remit. This makes it impossible for people to know how to comply with these new rules, and challenge police when they overreach. There has also been a counter-productive lack of clarity in government statements on these rules.""There have been amazing community responses to this pandemic, and people have shown they are willing to change the way they live - but that goodwill, and the broader aim of protecting public health, will be undermined by harsh and heavy handed policing.""Adam Wagner, a human rights barrister at Doughty Street Chambers in London and a visiting law professor at Goldsmiths University, tweeted: ""My sense is that there is major confusion over the difference between the government guidance and the law set out in the Coronavirus Regulations 2020. Police can advise the public but must make clear (and be clear themselves) what they have power to enforce.""",Newspaper
261,"How long will the UK coronavirus lockdown last?;Less than 12 hours after the Prime Minister's historic address to the nation, the London Underground was still jammed with commuters","March 31, 2020 Tuesday",International,telegraph.co.uk,1246,1246,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,"By Sarah Knapton, Science Editor","How long will the UK coronavirus lockdown last?Less than 12 hours after the Prime Minister's historic address to the nation, the London Underground was still jammed with commuters","Boris Johnson took the unprecedented step of curtailing individual freedoms to prevent the further spread of            coronavirus.The Prime Minister said that measures would be in place for three weeks-until April 13-and then reviewed. But given the expected trajectory of the disease, and the decisions taken by other countries who are ahead of Britain in terms of virus progression, it is unlikely the            restrictions will be lifted then.•What the UK lockdown means for youFor a start, compared to most countries, the UK had a porous and half-hearted beginning to its isolation measures, with seemingly few people choosing to stay inside. Less than 12 hours after the Prime Minister's historic address to the nation on March 23, the London Underground was jammed with commuters (see video below), while builders were seen eating together in communal canteens, making a mockery of the Government's rule that no more than two people can gather together in public.Professor Susan Michie, Director of the University College London's Centre for Behaviour Change, warned that some people would simply not be able to carry out the measures, even if they wanted to.""Five million self-employed people are being left potentially destitute by the Government failing to offer financial supportas they have done for directly employed workers,"" she said. ""Since [statutory sick pay of] £94 is not enough to pay rent, bills, food for a family etc, they will be forced to carry on as usual.""The British Transport Police is now on hand to make sure only            critical workers are using the London Underground. But such an inauspicious start to the lockdown suggests the virus will spread further than it would have, had stricter measures been implemented earlier,            as they have in other countries. And it means that the measures we do have are likely to be in place for longer to ""flatten the curve"" in a way that would prevent a second dangerous peak.Meanwhile, China has announced it will           finally be ending lockdown in Wuhanon April 8, a huge milestone for the country and a signal that the crisis-for them at least-is nearing its end. The city in Hubei province was the epicentre of the coronavirus outbreak.Yet it took more than two months of extremely draconian restrictions, including travel bans and quarantine zones, to achieve the level of containment seen in Wuhan. Britain is nowhere near that level of lockdown.And the Chinese restrictions were not lifted for more than 12 weeks after the first death, so if Britain follows a similar path, ours may need to be in place until the end of May/early June. Certainly, that is when the Government has said it expects cases to peak and then level out.However, from papers released recently, we know the Government is at least considering restricting movement for the rest of the year.The Scientific Pandemic Influenza Group on Modelling, which feeds into the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), proposed that because of the length of the outbreak, parts of the country could be placed in six-month lockdowns at a time, before being allowed more freedom. Professor Rowland Kao, the Sir Timothy O'Shea Professor of Veterinary Epidemiology and Data Science at the University of Edinburgh, said: ""It must be hoped that such measures will only last a relatively short time.""However, we must be prepared for this not to be the case, and for them to be in place for an extended period.""The next weeks until the Prime Minister's review will be crucial, as the unfolding epidemic will now be seen in real time, rather than through modelling, allowing experts to make more accurate predictions of when it will peak, and finally die away. It is also possible that after three weeks it becomes apparent that the costs to shutting down society far outweigh the benefit of slowing the spread and the government may choose to lift restrictions even before the peak.•Listen to the daily podcastProfessor Mark Woolhouse, Professor of Infectious Disease Epidemiology, University of Edinburgh, said: ""We now enter a phase of careful monitoring. We are looking for indicators first that the epidemic is slowing down and then for numbers of new cases to start to fall. ""After three weeks we will have to decide whether the restrictions need to be continued, can be relaxed, or can be relaxed temporarily with the expectation of imposing them again later. ""We must also monitor the damage that the lockdown is doing; damage to the economy, to education, to psychological well-being and to health and social care provision in the community. The impacts of this epidemic are too far reaching for policy decisions to be driven by epidemiology alone.""There are also hints that countries in Europe may be on a slightly faster course than China, and may peak sooner, meaning restrictions could be lifted earlier. While cases in China peaked some 72 days after the first recorded infections, public health officials in both Germany and Italy believe that they are starting to see a plateauing now, which could mean a peak of around 57 and 53 days respectively.Earlier this week, the Prime Minister said that we are two weeks behind Italy so Britain may end up peaking by the beginning of April. China left lockdown restrictions in place for nearly a month after the peak, so it is possible restrictions could be lifted early in May.Professor Sheila Bird said that more cases in coming days and weeks would make it easier for the Government to predict how the epidemic is responding to lockdown measures, which will inform how long they remain in place. ""Once an epidemic takes hold, as now in UK, the country's own data - properly reported and interpreted - take precedence over modelling as the data tell us the actual actual toll which the epidemic is exacting,"" she said.""A huge amount can be inferred about the immediately forthcoming weeks from these data directly, including whether further policy changes are needed to reinforce social-distancing; for example in particular age groups.""Some experts are still concerned that the current restrictions do not go far enough while others say the government has been hit by an ""epidemic of action"", and is now bringing in measures that have little rationale. Professor Robert Dingwall, Professor of Sociology, at Nottingham Trent University, wrote in The Telegraph: ""It is another triumph of populism over science, of a capitulation to the demand to 'do something'. ""We are still seeing some notion that 'the people' are selfish and must be bullied and disciplined. ""The people are not selfish; they have behaved in ways that are individually rational but have collectively irrational results.""However Dr Andrea Collins, Senior Clinical Lecturer in Respiratory Medicine at the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine (LSTM), said: ""I believe that they have not quite gone far enough. The 'absolutely' necessary to go to work is still being used by some when it is not required-I think we need permits across controlled areas to go to a workplace.""Recent modelling from the universities of Exeter, Bristol and Warwick suggested that without any measures at all, the epidemic would have peaked around 133 days after first person-to-person transmission in Britain, which happened around February 28. So the lockdown has the potential of curtailing the spread by around seven weeks. A welcome relief for people who could have been facing lockdown for most of the summer.",Newspaper; Web Publication
262,"Absolutely wrong': how UK's coronavirus test strategy unravelled;Ministers shrugged off warnings a lack of tests could cost lives, until they were forced to change tackCoronavirus - latest updatesSee all our coronavirus coverage","April 1, 2020 Wednesday",International,The Guardian (London),1728,1728,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,Sarah Boseley Health editor,"Absolutely wrong': how UK's coronavirus test strategy unravelledMinisters shrugged off warnings a lack of tests could cost lives, until they were forced to change tackCoronavirus - latest updatesSee all our coronavirus coverage","On 11 March, the day before Boris Johnson told the nation that the coronavirus sweeping the UK could no longer be contained and that testing for Covid-19 would stop except for the seriously ill in hospital, the head of No 10's ""nudge unit"" gave a brief interview to the BBC.At the time it was barely noticed - it was budget day, after all. With hindsight, it seems astonishing. ""There's going to be a point, assuming the epidemic flows and grows as it will do, where you want to cocoon, to protect those at-risk groups so they don't catch the disease,"" said           Dr David Halpern. ""By the time they come out of their cocooning, herd immunity has been achieved in the rest of the population.""It was a window into the thinking of the political strategists directing the UK response to Covid-19, who claimed to base what they were doing on scientific evidence. We would let the disease spread among the healthy. So no need to test.If there was a moment when the UK turned its back on the traditional public health approach to fighting an epidemic, this was it.Ebola, Sars, Mers - in previous epidemics, nobody had questioned the need to hunt down and eliminate the virus by testing everyone with symptoms, tracking their contacts and isolating and testing those people in turn. But not this time.""You can't fight a fire blindfold,"" said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the director general of the World Health Organization, just five days after the UK switched course in what sounded like an urgent appeal to Johnson, Halpern and any fellow travellers.""You can't stop this pandemic if you don't know who is infected. We have a simple message for all countries: test, test, test. Test every suspected case. If they test positive, isolate them and find out who they have been in close contact with up to two days before they developed symptoms and test those people too.""But his warnings were shrugged off by government ministers in the UK - public health experts had been sidelined and a newer breed of scientist was in favour at No 10.According to Richard Horton, editor-in-chief of the Lancet medical journal, the dominant voices in the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), the scientific expert group advising the government, were mathematical modellers and behavioural scientists, including Halpern. On 25 March, Horton told MPs on the science and technology select committee that Sage appeared to have little input from public health experts and doctors, despite being chaired by the chief medical officer, Chris Whitty, and the chief scientific officer, Sir Patrick Vallance. The clue for Horton was in the main papers it considered in advising the government of the strategy. ""There is evidence on modelling and on behavioural science, but I don't see the evidence from the public health community or from the clinical community,"" he explained. Testing, isolation and quarantine - basic public health interventions - were barely on the agenda. Warnings from Chinese scientists of the severity of Covid-19 had not been understood.""We thought we could have a controlled epidemic. We thought we could manage that epidemic over the course of March and April, push the curve to the right, build up herd immunity and that way we could protect people,"" said Horton. ""The reason why that strategy was wrong is it didn't recognise that 20% of people infected would end up with severe critical illness. The evidence was there at the end of January.""Anthony Costello, a UK paediatrician and former director of the WHO, also fiercely criticised the decision to stop tests. ""For me and the WHO people I have spoken to, this is absolutely the wrong policy,""            he           said. ""The basic public health approach is playing second fiddle to mathematical modelling.""Less than two weeks on from the lockdown that Johnson announced on 23 March, the original strategy, the decisions that came before and after it, and the UK's inability to ramp up testing for NHS staff - let alone anyone else - are under unrelenting scrutiny.Ministers have been flailing. What has emerged is a picture of confusion and uncertainty at the top, with ministers making promises they cannot keep and apparently with little comprehension of the global tussle for tests that may make it impossible for the UK to buy its way belatedly out of the problem. The UK is now competing with every other nation to obtain the kits it needs, particularly the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test, which tells someone whether they have Covid-19 or not. The Guardian has been told that presidents and prime ministers are trying to outbid each other to secure these kits and their components, which are in short supply. The US also has woken up to the need to test - and is telling companies that export them that America must come first.No wonder, perhaps, the UK now finds itself struggling to increase testing to 25,000 a day for hospital patients and health workers, let alone meet its ambition - once stated but now seldom mentioned - to reach 100,000 a day, to include other key workers. ""In all countries we have prime ministers calling the CEOs and diagnostic companies to try to get hold of the stocks. Indonesia and Peru we know have offered to order several million tests and send private planes to pick the tests up. There is more going on behind the scenes to secure supplies,"" said Dr Catharina Boehme, chief executive of the non-profit Geneva-based Foundation for Innovative New Diagnostics, which is a WHO collaborating centre.The companies are trying to be responsible, she said. ""They supply small quantities to each country to give sufficient supplies for a number of days and then ship on a very frequent basis. But there is clearly this move in the US where several companies have openly declared they can't supply anyone outside the US.""Three US companies making the PCR tests, Abbott, Hologic and Cepheid, have been told not to export them, leaving Africa - which uses their technology in HIV tests - with a single supplier, Roche in Switzerland.The WHO, Unicef and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation are working on procuring tests for low- and middle-income countries. There are global shortages even of the swabs, which are made by companies in just two countries, the US and Italy. In the UK, the testing regime has also been hampered by the lack of laboratory capacity to analyse the samples - a warehouse in Milton Keynes has been set up with the laboratory facilities to add capacity.In the long term, hopes are pinned on blood tests for antibodies produced by the immune system fighting the infection, which will show who has had Covid-19 and is probably therefore immune. These could be a game-changer, allowing key workers out of isolation, for instance to reopen schools.But another sign of the disconnect between public health experts and Downing Street became evident last Wednesday. Prof Sharon Peacock, director of infections at Public Health England, told MPs that millions of home testing kits would be available, delivered by Amazon or bought in Boots, within days, not weeks.""Tests are being ordered across Europe and elsewhere and purchased in south-east Asia. This is widespread practice. We are not alone in doing this,"" she said.But within hours, Whitty seemed to quash the idea. He warned that antibody tests needed proper evaluation, which was being undertaken at Oxford University. ""The key thing for us to do is evaluate. Are these tests accurate enough to be used by the general public?"" he said at the prime minister's press conference the same day. The health secretary, Matt Hancock, has said the government had bought 3.5m antibody tests, but the Guardian understands the UK has actually put in orders for 40m more. It is the sort of drastic gamble that governments around the world are taking, afraid that stocks will disappear.Antibody tests are available right now on the internet to anyone who wants them - but some are unreliable, and could give the wrong verdict. So far, the best are 90% sensitive to Covid-19 and 90% specific. The perils are all too apparent, and not just for the antibody tests: Spain and the Czech Republic recently had to send back hundreds of thousands of antigen tests to China because they had an accurate detection rate of just 30%.Antibody tests are being used widely in China and South Korea, where the virus has already been beaten down to lower levels by the traditional PCR testing of those with symptoms and tracing and isolating their contacts.Mass contact tracing, which can be highly labour-intensive, is made possible through phone apps, which alert people who have been near someone who has tested positive.The concept was greeted with horror by some in the UK as mass data gathering and an invasion of privacy - yet Oxford University is now developing just such an app.Looking ahead to the endgame, testing and tracing contacts, figuring out where the virus has been and who is still vulnerable is widely acknowledged among scientists to be the way to stamp out the last pockets of a pandemic.For now, Italy is doing more testing than any other country, desperate to bring down its cases and fatality rates.Not far behind is Germany, which has been doing widespread testing of suspects with symptoms and contact tracing in the WHO-recommended fashion from the beginning. Its efforts are being led by the renowned public health body, the Robert Koch Institute.And while they are the first to say the pandemic is in its early stages and could yet explode in Germany, the rise in cases and deaths has not been not as sharp as in the UK and nowhere near the levels seen in Italy and Spain.It remains to be seen whether the new UK attention to testing can help bring the numbers down here as well. In a few short weeks, a strategy that rejected old science for new seems to have unravelled - and testing has suddenly become central to the fight against Covid-19.Testing is being carried out in hospitals, new and old, and in places such as the huge vacant car park of Chessington World of Adventures in Surrey, where every ride stands still. Under temporary canvas roofs, nurses in wind-blown plastic aprons, gloves and masks lean into open car windows to swab the nose and back of the mouth of healthcare workers, who may have the telltale dry cough, or are isolating because their child or partner has.",Newspaper
263,Sway by Pragya Agarwal review - how we are all unconsciously biased;Does 'nudging' work? And how useful is it to assume that people 'are not naturally rational'? This is an urgent study of the political harm of bias,"April 1, 2020 Wednesday",International,The Guardian (London),1265,1265,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,Steven Poole,Sway by Pragya Agarwal review - how we are all unconsciously biasedDoes 'nudging' work? And how useful is it to assume that people 'are not naturally rational'? This is an urgent study of the political harm of bias," In experiments, people perceive an approaching spider to be moving much faster than it really is, and faster than a ping-pong ball or other neutral object moving at the same speed. It is reasonable to deduce, then, that humans generally have an unconscious bias against spiders. Nothing too depressing about society follows from this. But the idea that we are prey to unconscious bias in more important areas - to do with decision-making, and how we treat our fellow bipeds - has in recent decades become a hot topic. It is at the root of what is called ""behavioural science"" and ""nudge politics"", which reports suggested were driving the British government's laissez-faire early coronavirus strategy. But how strong is the evidence that it exists?It was the field of behavioural economics, as described in Daniel Kahneman's bestseller           Thinking, Fast and Slow, that demonstrated that humans do not make mathematically perfect decisions about probability; they instead rely on rough rules of thumb, and often go wrong. Some of these habits are uncontroversial, such as confirmation bias (you tend to notice only the evidence that confirms what you already believe). But the inference by the field that such biases mean - as Pragya Agarwal uncritically repeats here - that ""humans are not naturally rational"" is extremely dubious, especially since it depends heavily on which definition of rationality you use.For example, the finding that people care about the possible loss of some money more than they care about the possible win of the same amount is considered an irrational bias, because mathematically they are equal sides of the same bet. So trying harder to prevent the loss is called the bias of ""loss aversion"" - at least among comfortably tenured academics. On the other hand, if you have very little money in the first place, it is perfectly rational to care very deeply about losing an amount that might ruin you, and it is sensible not to risk that for a 50/50 chance of winning.Agarwal, a data scientist who has worked on the dynamics of social interactions, also endorses some of the wilder claims of evolutionary psychologists in the area of rationality. My favourite among these is the crazy theory that, as she endorses it, ""our brains have evolved to reason adaptively rather than rationally or truthfully"", which is the fashionable modern version of the Cretan liar paradox. If it's true, after all, then I have no reason to believe it is true.That's not to say that we are not prey to any failures of rationality at all, of course - a fact already conceded by Jonathan Swift when he sardonically modified            Aristotle 's definition of man as the rational animal to man as ""the animal capable of rationality"". And Agarwal tells some colourfully persuasive stories about how such potential bugs in our mindware contribute to the degradation of our public sphere. The flipside of confirmation bias, she explains, is the less snappily named ""disconfirmation bias"", which is when we ""spend considerable energy in denigrating arguments that run counter to our existing beliefs"". Remind you of any particular social media platform? ""Often when we are picking up our phones or tablets and browsing, we are doing so while waiting in a queue or having our coffee or pretending to be working, and so we skim, share and retweet quickly,"" she writes, almost as though she has had a crack surveillance team following me for years, and it is this very rapidity that makes biased responses more likely. Cleverly, Agarwal also notes an asymmetry in terms for the phenomenon whereby people on social media end up hearing only from people who think like themselves. I, an intellectual, lament the fact that I am in a ""filter bubble"", while you, a bigoted yahoo, live in an ""echo chamber"".Evolutionary explanations must be part of the puzzle here, but it is often tempting to exceed their proper scope. Prejudice against people not like ourselves, for example, doubtless originated in early humans for perfectly good reasons. ""Humans appear to have a bias that members of out-groups or competitive tribes are less magnanimous and more dangerous than those who belong to our in-groups,"" Agarwal writes, which was fair enough on the savannah. But such explanations might imply that these biases are innate, so she also denies that they are ""necessarily hardwired"", and suggests they can be unlearned. This optimistic message, though, can sit in awkward tension with the simplistic neuro-determinism by which she claims that specific brain regions (such as the amygdala) or hormones (oxytocin) programme our responses.For issues of racial and other discrimination, do we really need the idea of ""unconscious"" bias at all? Someone scrawling Islamophobic graffiti on a wall is obviously quite conscious about it. Agarwal has chosen throughout to use the terms ""implicit bias"" and ""unconscious bias"" interchangeably. The first is linked to a controversial psychological tool called the Implicit Association Test, the arguments over which show the difficulty of proving the existence of something that is, ex hypothesi, unconscious and so unavailable to the subject's introspection. So the IAT uses reaction times as a proxy for the assumed bias: if a white person is slower by some number of milliseconds to associate a black face with a desirable social role, for example, then they are said to have an implicit bias against black people.Nearly a fifth of people in Britain who are stopped and asked to prove their immigration status are, in fact, BritishDespite doubts over particular methodologies, we can agree that there must be something to the idea that racist and sexist prejudice can operate below conscious awareness, and Sway succeeds impressively in its drive to show that justice is undermined by a rich array of social biases about age, gender, race, accent, and so forth. Unconscious bias is a plausible explanation for why so many white American policemen, even those who are not explicitly racist, end up shooting so many unarmed black men; why hurricanes given women's names (eg,            Katrina ) are perceived as less frightening than those with men's names; and why nearly a fifth of people in Britain who are stopped in the street and asked to prove their immigration status are, in fact, British. (Agarwal is appropriately scathing about the ""post-racial"" claim that there is no racism in Britain any more: an idea, I have noticed but she is too polite to say, that tends to be most eagerly promoted by those who are, in fact, racists.) One can disagree with her presentation of the science, but Agarwal's diagnosis of the political harms of bias is passionate and urgent.What can we do about our own biases? The key is to pause, breathe, and realise that the spider is not really racing towards us so fast. Research on ""debiasing"" has attracted scepticism from those invested in the ""nudge politics"" model - understandably, because for nudge politics to work, we must remain biased automata vulnerable to its paternalistic guidance. And yet many biases can be overcome if we are made aware of them, and incorporate a check for them into our slow, deliberative thinking. ""We need time, intention and adequate cognitive capacity and resources to be aware of the activation of stereotypes,"" Agarwal writes hopefully, ""and then to significantly reduce the application of any stereotypical beliefs on others around us.""

""But what's also really important is that, if we stop these too quickly, there is a possibility that that massive effort people have made across the country is wasted and we could potentially see a dangerous second peak. We absolutely want to avoid that.""Police-enforced restrictions on movement mean people can only leave their house to exercise, shop for essential items or go to work if they cannot work from home.Lord King said it was ""unrealistic"" to think the lockdown could continue for ""months and months on end"" and called for a gradual exit strategy to protect the economy and citizens' well-being.Data released from the Department of Transport - illustrated in the above graph - showed that after consistently dropping from March 23, when the lockdown was announced, the number of people travelling on buses and Tubes in London rose slightly on March 30.The numbers of those using their cars and vans rose by 10 per cent on the same day, from 27 per cent of normal levels on the Sunday to 37 per cent on Monday.Professor Yvonne Doyle, Medical Director of Public Health England, described the ""uptick in motor vehicle traffic"" as a ""slightly concerning trend"".Professor Susan Michie, director of the Centre for Behaviour Change at University College London and a member of the Scientific Pandemic Influenza Group on Behavioural Science which advises the Government, said people going to work still make up around 30 per cent of the trips outside the home.Describing the figure as ""quite a concern"", she said that one group of people who are still working is the five million self-employed who will not receive any money until June under support measures announced by the Chancellor last week.""A lot of them, because of their circumstances, will carry on working - they have families to feed and they have no money coming in and that is a really urgent issue,"" Prof Michie told The Telegraph.She also raised concerns that a lot of people were going to workplaces where social distancing measures of keeping two metres apart were not being enforced.""We know that adherence [to lockdown] gets worse as time goes on generally, but is also worse among people who are financially insecure or on low incomes and also among those who are worried about access to provisions such as food or water,"" she said. Prof Michie said the Government now needs to get on the ""front foot"" and incentivise people to stay at home. ""We are only a week in and it is important to think about the problems that are likely to start as time goes on,"" she said. ""There are financial and practical pressures, issues of boredom, frustration, depression and for people living on their own, loneliness. Those things increase over time, and even more so for people in financially insecure circumstances.""She said that as time goes on people might lose the ""motivation"" to stay indoors and ""as the weather gets better more and more people will want to be outside"".Professor John Ashton, former president of the Faculty of Public Health, said compliance with the lockdown is dependent on trust and ""trust in the Government is fairly low because they have failed to be open and transparent from the beginning"".""I said from the outset that they need to take the public with them, but they were treating people like children,"" Prof Ashton said. ""If you want people to behave like adults then you have to treat them like adults and then they will play their part.""He said that among the failures in the Government response to the pandemic has been a failure to be honest about testing capability and personal protective equipment and a failure to share data even among medical professionals.""I think it is a danger that the lockdown might not stick,"" he added.Prof Ashton said that one way in which the Government could help enforce the measures was to roll out testing which would allow the restrictions to be altered according to need.However, the authorities on Wednesday night insisted that the vast majority of people are complying with the rules. The deputy chief medical officer for England, Professor Jonathan Van Tam said: ""I know how incredibly disruptive this has been for people across the country, but these measures are essential to help support the NHS.""Whatever the weather, we all have a shared responsibility to protect those around us, and the single most important action we can all take in fighting coronavirus is to stay at home in order to protect the NHS and save lives.""A Government spokesman said: ""Our message is clear - people should stay at home. This will save lives, protect the vulnerable and protect the NHS. The restrictive measures the PM announced last week remain in place. Police across the UK have the powers they need to enforce these where necessary.""A spokesman for the National Police Chiefs Council said that they had seen an ""overwhelming response"" to the lockdown measures last weekend and are hopeful that the public will continue to abide by the rules this weekend.

265,A public inquiry into the UK's coronavirus response would find a litany of failures;Any self-respecting pandemic crisis team should have realised the importance of mass testing from the outset Anthony Costello is a former director of maternal and child health at the World Health Organization Coronavirus - latest updates See all our coronavirus coverage,"April 1, 2020 Wednesday",International,The Guardian (London),1107,1107,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,Anthony Costello,A public inquiry into the UK's coronavirus response would find a litany of failuresAny self-respecting pandemic crisis team should have realised the importance of mass testing from the outset Anthony Costello is a former director of maternal and child health at the World Health Organization Coronavirus - latest updates See all our coronavirus coverage,"Will the inevitable public inquiry into the UK's Covid-19 response pin the blame on a few scapegoats? I hope not. Britain's failure to move quickly and effectively is the symptom of a more comprehensive system failure. More than three months after the virus first appeared in Wuhan, England and Wales still lack the necessary testing capacity and surveillance infrastructure to shut down the epidemic. Crucial frontline workers are still doing their jobs without adequate personal protective equipment. Public Health England (PHE) seem unable to increase the daily number of tests in line with European neighbours. As other countries acted swiftly to contain the epidemic, the UK appears indecisive and delayed, shifting late in the day from a controversial herd immunity strategy to a lockdown. History won't look kindly on Britain's response.We must ask at least five far-reaching questions about how our health system deals with a pandemic. First: who's in charge? Many actors have been involved in devising a response to coronavirus - Downing Street and its advisers; Cobra; the Department of Health and Social Care; NHS England; PHE and its Scottish, Northern Irish and Welsh counterparts; the National Institute for Health Research; the chief medical officer, Chris Whitty; the chief scientific adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance; and the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (UK Sage). Coordination appears chaotic. I've reliably been told that leaders across these various bodies often don't know what each other is doing.Pandemics move fast; if you don't get ahead of a virus, it quickly spreadsThe second question concerns history. The UK's haphazard coronavirus response wasn't just a result of chaotic planning. The groundwork was laid years ago. During the last decade, funding for public health has been fragmented and downgraded. In 2013, the Lansley reforms created PHE, a new executive agency within the Department of Health and Social Care that was separate from the NHS. Its mission was to protect and improve the nation's health in order to address inequalities. Its funding came from local authority budgets; as local authorities suffered the sharp end of austerity, funding for PHE stagnated. Spending on the public health grant in 2019-20 was £850           m           lower in real terms than initial allocations in 2015           -16.Today, the repercussions of fragmentation and underfunding are clear. Scaling up Covid-19 testing requires a community surveillance system that integrates PHE local outbreak management teams with NHS primary care facilities and laboratories. In its 3 March           Covid-19 action plan, PHE  assured us that ""once a case has been detected, our public health agencies use tried-and-tested procedures for rapid tracing, monitoring and isolation of close contacts, with the aim of preventing further spread"". By all accounts, this didn't happen at scale. On 12 March PHE stopped all community testing as part of the government's delay strategy, instead focusing its efforts on patients and health workers.The third question is political. This epidemic has tested the reigning political emphasis on market mechanisms and public-private partnerships, and found it wanting. During a national epidemic, our system of outsourced providers and internal markets simply doesn't work. As one senior British doctor close to the Covid-19 crisis organisation told me, the chaos of the UK's response has ""reflected the wholesale destruction of a coordinated and focused state sector. Outsourcing, delegated powers, internal markets ... have made a single response impossible. It is affecting every aspect of policy.""A fourth question concerns the pool of experts advising the government. Vallance has stated that UK Sage comprises the best of British science - with expertise in virology, mathematical modelling and behavioural science. But for an overall crisis response, UK Sage was too narrow in scope. It needed public health science, logistics, IT, social and citizen science, communications and community mobilisation expertise at the table. Government funding for health has always had a strong bias towards clinical medicine. According to one 2018 report from Nesta, 94% of all health research funds are spent on clinical medicine, drugs and biosciences; only 6% is divided between psychology and behavioural sciences, and public and community health. During an epidemic, public health expertise is vital.But perhaps the gravest problem with the UK's response is that it didn't act sooner. The 12 March decision to stop community testing meant the government effectively gave up on containing the spread of the epidemic. In South Korea, regional data and maps about coronavirus deaths are available online,  and virus test data shows that just two out of 18 regions account for 84% of cases .  The UK doesn't have a reliable regional data bank because it collected too little community information. Where South Korea and China used digital apps to assist contact tracing, clinical deterioration and quarantine compliance, NHS Digital has simply recorded data since 18 March on 111 calls and online assessments. This data is not linked to community case surveillance or quarantine.Maybe it is already too late in the day for the government to remedy these mistakes. Pandemics move fast; if you don't get ahead of a virus, it quickly spreads. The government stuck stubbornly to its delay policy to ""flatten the curve"" through social distancing alone, despite the evidence of epidemic suppression through testing in South Korea, Singapore, Hong Kong, China, Taiwan and Germany, which have all recorded lower death rates.On 23 March Paul Romer, a Nobel prize-winning economist, wrote a blog           post about his models of social distancing and community mass testing. ""If we contrast a nonspecific policy of social distance with a targeted policy guided by frequent testing ... how much more disruptive is the nonspecific policy? Answer? Way more disruptive."" Though an economy can survive with 10% of its population in isolation, it can't survive when that figure is 50% or above. Without community surveillance and testing in place to detect new outbreaks and isolate individuals once the current lockdown is lifted, we face hugely damaging national lockdowns, over and over again. Any self-respecting Cobra, UK Sage or pandemic crisis team should have realised the importance of mass testing from the outset, and never allowed this to happen.

266,How reading The Times can help keep dementia at bay,"April 1, 2020 Wednesday",International,The Times (London),333,333,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,Greg Hurst,How reading The Times can help keep dementia at bay,"Reading The Times is one way to help ward off dementia, according to a study. Researchers found that mentally stimulating activities can significantly lower the risk of developing the condition.

270,Coronavirus mass testing won't help UK get out of lockdown scientists warn;Mass testing has worked for countries like South Korea - but could stop people from self-isolating in the UK.,"April 1, 2020 Wednesday",International,dailyrecord.co.uk,476,476,"Scotland
United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland",By Sophie Law,Coronavirus mass testing won't help UK get out of lockdown scientists warnMass testing has worked for countries like South Korea - but could stop people from self-isolating in the UK.,"Mass public testing forcoronaviruscould stop people from self-isolating and social distancing during the pandemic, scientists have warned.There is a risk that people who have hadCovid- 19and are now immune will return to normal life and be followed by others who are still at risk of catching the deadly virus.Another concern is that people who are fed up with isolation will go out and simply claim to have had the infection, according to scientists.However, mass testing has worked for countries like South Korea which saw cases of Covid-19 sharply drop without going intolockdown.Sturgeon: Intensive care influx expected as coronavirus deaths in Scotland rise to 76Professor Madelynne Arden at Sheffield Hallam University and Professor Christopher Armitage at the University of Manchester, wrote of their concerns to England's chief medical officer Chris Whitty and Health Secretary Matt Hancock,Birmingham Livereports.In an email they told the officials: ""News that home/community testing for Covid-19 will soon be possible seems really positive, and as a family who developed mild symptoms we, like others, would be keen to have this test to know if we have immunity.""However, as professors, HCPC-registered health psychologists and experts in behavioural science, we are very concerned about the likely effect of mass public testing for Covid-19 on people's reactions to public health messages to stay at home and socially isolate.Coronavirus strongest symptom identified after more than a million people analysed""It may well be that these issues are already being given careful consideration, in which case we apologise for taking up your valuable time, but we felt compelled to write in case they are not.""The professors added: ""Making tests easily available in the community could therefore have detrimental effects on public social isolation and therefore on the spread and containment of Covid-19.""They urge careful planning on how the tests will be managed.Coronavirus in ScotlandThe scientists say social norms to isolate are extremely important, pointing to the weekend of March 21/22, when a large number of people were seen out and about despite government guidance.The email explains: ""Clearly the Government expected that people would make rational assessments of personal/family risk and that, once they realised that physical separation would not be possible in a tourist location, they would turn around and go back home.

271,"How long will the UK coronavirus lockdown last?;Less than 12 hours after the Prime Minister's historic address to the nation, the London Underground was still jammed with commuters","April 1, 2020 Wednesday",International,telegraph.co.uk,1348,1348,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,"By Sarah Knapton, Science Editor","How long will the UK coronavirus lockdown last?Less than 12 hours after the Prime Minister's historic address to the nation, the London Underground was still jammed with commuters","Boris Johnson took the unprecedented step of curtailing individual freedoms to prevent the further spread of            coronavirus.The Prime Minister said that measures would be in place for three weeks-until April 13-and then reviewed. But given the expected trajectory of the disease, and the decisions taken by other countries who are ahead of Britain in terms of virus progression, it is unlikely the restrictions will be lifted then.•What the UK lockdown means for youFor a start, compared to most countries, the UK had a porous and half-hearted beginning to its isolation measures, with seemingly few people choosing to stay inside. Less than 12 hours after the Prime Minister's historic address to the nation on March 23, the London Underground was jammed with commuters (see video below), while builders were seen eating together in communal canteens, making a mockery of the Government's rule that no more than two people can gather together in public.Professor Susan Michie, Director of the University College London's Centre for Behaviour Change, warned that some people would simply not be able to carry out the measures, even if they wanted to.""Five million self-employed people are being left potentially destitute by the Government failing to offer financial supportas they have done for directly employed workers,"" she said. ""Since [statutory sick pay of] £94 is not enough to pay rent, bills, food for a family etc, they will be forced to carry on as usual.""The British Transport Police is now on hand to make sure only            critical workers are using the London Underground. But such an inauspicious start to the lockdown suggests the virus will spread further than it would have, had stricter measures been implemented earlier,            as they have in other countries. And it means that the measures we do have are likely to be in place for longer to ""flatten the curve"" in a way that would prevent a second dangerous peak.In addition, on April 1 the Government revealed figures that suggested the lockdown was starting to fray as data showed an ""uptick""            in the number of people using transport.The number of those using their cars and public transport, which had been consistently dropping since strict social distancing measures were introduced, rose for the first time.It is feared that sunny weather will prompt more people to break the rules and go outside and socialise as the Easter holidays begin.Mervyn King, the former Governor of the Bank of England, warned that there could be a ""rebellion"" if the measures are enforced for too long. Meanwhile, China has announced it will           finally be ending lockdown in Wuhanon April 8, a huge milestone for the country and a signal that the crisis-for them at least-is nearing its end. The city in Hubei province was the epicentre of the coronavirus outbreak.Yet it took more than two months of extremely draconian restrictions, including travel bans and quarantine zones, to achieve the level of containment seen in Wuhan. Britain is nowhere near that level of lockdown.And the Chinese restrictions were not lifted for more than 12 weeks after the first death, so if Britain follows a similar path, ours may need to be in place until the end of May/early June. Certainly, that is when the Government has said it expects cases to peak and then level out.However, from papers released recently, we know the Government is at least considering restricting movement for the rest of the year.The Scientific Pandemic Influenza Group on Modelling, which feeds into the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), proposed that because of the length of the outbreak, parts of the country could be placed in six-month lockdowns at a time, before being allowed more freedom. Professor Rowland Kao, the Sir Timothy O'Shea Professor of Veterinary Epidemiology and Data Science at the University of Edinburgh, said: ""It must be hoped that such measures will only last a relatively short time.""However, we must be prepared for this not to be the case, and for them to be in place for an extended period.""The next weeks until the Prime Minister's review will be crucial, as the unfolding epidemic will now be seen in real time, rather than through modelling, allowing experts to make more accurate predictions of when it will peak, and finally die away. It is also possible that after three weeks it becomes apparent that the costs to shutting down society far outweigh the benefit of slowing the spread and the government may choose to lift restrictions even before the peak.•Listen to the daily podcastProfessor Mark Woolhouse, Professor of Infectious Disease Epidemiology, University of Edinburgh, said: ""We now enter a phase of careful monitoring. We are looking for indicators first that the epidemic is slowing down and then for numbers of new cases to start to fall. ""After three weeks we will have to decide whether the restrictions need to be continued, can be relaxed, or can be relaxed temporarily with the expectation of imposing them again later. ""We must also monitor the damage that the lockdown is doing; damage to the economy, to education, to psychological well-being and to health and social care provision in the community. The impacts of this epidemic are too far reaching for policy decisions to be driven by epidemiology alone.""There are also hints that countries in Europe may be on a slightly faster course than China, and may peak sooner, meaning restrictions could be lifted earlier. While cases in China peaked some 72 days after the first recorded infections, public health officials in both Germany and Italy believe that they are starting to see a plateauing now, which could mean a peak of around 57 and 53 days respectively.Earlier this week, the Prime Minister said that we are two weeks behind Italy so Britain may end up peaking by the beginning of April. China left lockdown restrictions in place for nearly a month after the peak, so it is possible restrictions could be lifted early in May.Professor Sheila Bird said that more cases in coming days and weeks would make it easier for the Government to predict how the epidemic is responding to lockdown measures, which will inform how long they remain in place. ""Once an epidemic takes hold, as now in UK, the country's own data - properly reported and interpreted - take precedence over modelling as the data tell us the actual toll which the epidemic is exacting,"" she said.""A huge amount can be inferred about the immediately forthcoming weeks from these data directly, including whether further policy changes are needed to reinforce social-distancing; for example in particular age groups.""Some experts are still concerned that the current restrictions do not go far enough while others say the government has been hit by an ""epidemic of action"", and is now bringing in measures that have little rationale. Professor Robert Dingwall, Professor of Sociology, at Nottingham Trent University, wrote in The Telegraph: ""It is another triumph of populism over science, of a capitulation to the demand to 'do something'. ""We are still seeing some notion that 'the people' are selfish and must be bullied and disciplined. ""The people are not selfish; they have behaved in ways that are individually rational but have collectively irrational results.""However Dr Andrea Collins, Senior Clinical Lecturer in Respiratory Medicine at the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine (LSTM), said: ""I believe that they have not quite gone far enough. The 'absolutely' necessary to go to work is still being used by some when it is not required-I think we need permits across controlled areas to go to a workplace.""Recent modelling from the universities of Exeter, Bristol and Warwick suggested that without any measures at all, the epidemic would have peaked around 133 days after first person-to-person transmission in Britain, which happened around February 28. So the lockdown has the potential of curtailing the spread by around seven weeks. A welcome relief for people who could have been facing lockdown for most of the summer.",Newspaper; Web Publication
272,Coronavirus: Inside the UK government's influential behavioural 'nudge unit';Former intelligence analyst specialised in China and cyber warfare has just joined key team,"April 2, 2020 Thursday",International,The Independent (United Kingdom),919,919,England & Wales,Kim Sengupta,Coronavirus: Inside the UK government's influential behavioural 'nudge unit'Former intelligence analyst specialised in China and cyber warfare has just joined key team,"A senior figure from the world of intelligence and defence, who specialised in China and cyber warfare, has been appointed to one of the top posts in the government's ""nudge unit"", which is involved in the campaign against the coronavirus outbreak.Rachel Coyle, who has received an MBE for services to defence, is the new managing director of the Behavioural Insights Team (BIT) helping to develop strategy for the pandemic at the Cabinet Office.The work of the ""nudge unit"" was relatively little known until its role became more widely publicised over Covid-19, especially over the concept of ""herd immunity"" to combat the virus and the effect this had on the timing of the eventual lockdown ordered by Boris Johnson.Ms Coyle, who has a masters in Chinese studies from Cambridge, spent six years at the Ministry of Defence, where she started as analyst with Mandarin language skills before being promoted to policy advisor at the Permanent Joint Headquarters, then private secretary to the deputy chief of defence staff (military strategy & operations) General Sir Richard Barrons, and finally assistant head of cyber operations policy.After receiving her MBE in 2013, Ms Coyle joined Salamanca, a business intelligence and investigations group, where she became head of corporate intelligence in charge of the company's international offices.Starting her job with the ""nudge unit"" at the end of last month, Ms Coyle stated in a social media post: ""I'm really proud to have started a new role as managing director for the Behavioural Insights Team.""General Barrons, who went on to become chief of joint forces command, said: ""Rachel was one of the sharpest civil servants I have ever come across. I found her very impressive and she will no doubt do a very good job at a very difficult time.""As deputy chief of defence staff, General Barrons was in charge of the military support for national resilience and security in natural or man-made disasters as well as conflicts.He told The Independent: ""The potential risk of global pandemic has been with us for a very long time. Questions have to be asked of the government, industry and civil society on the level of preparedness when this pandemic occurred.                     ""We can't have been completely surprised. In the future we obviously need to be better prepared. But we must not make the mistake of thinking that it's all just about pandemics. There will be a whole range of challenges ranging from climate change, the rise of China and the role of Russia. There needs to be a focus on strategy.""The strategy of ""nudging"" is based on the premise of changing behaviour through coaxing and pointing out positive outcomes to actions rather than through coercion. It was set up 10 years ago by the Cameron government and ownership is shared between its staff, the Cabinet Office and the charity Nesta which deals with innovations.David Halpern, BIT's chief executive, and a member of the Government's Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (SAGE) outlined to the BBC on 11 March the approach of shielding vulnerable people until enough of the country's population had been infected with Covid-19, and immunity would be acquired to halt its spread.""There's going to be a point, assuming the epidemic flows and grows as it will do, where you want to cocoon, to protect those at-risk groups so they don't catch the disease. By the time they come out of their cocooning, herd immunity has been achieved in the rest of the population,"" he said.On the same day Dominic Cummings, the chief advisor to Boris Johnson, is reported to have brought up the issue of herd immunity in a discussion with tech industry leaders. Two days later the government's chief scientific adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance, told BBC Radio 4 that one of the key things we need to do is to ""build up some kind of herd immunity so more people are immune to this disease and we reduce the transmission"".Matt Hancock, the health secretary, insisted a few days later that achieving herd immunity was not a stated policy. Instead, he said, ""in the coming weeks"" people over the age of 70 will be told to self-isolate.Richard Horton, editor-in-chief of the medical journal Lancet told the Commons Science and Technology Select Committee at the end of last month that SAGE, despite being chaired by the chief medical officer, Chris Whitty, and the chief scientific officer, Sir Patrick Vallance, had little input from public health doctors and medical officers. The dominant voices advising the government, he said, were mathematical modellers and behavioural scientists, including Dr Halpern.""There is evidence on modelling and on behavioural science, but I don't see the evidence from the public health community or from the clinical community,"" he said.""We thought we could have a controlled epidemic. We thought we could manage that epidemic over the course of March and April, push the curve to the right, build up herd immunity and that way we could protect people. The reason why that strategy was wrong is it didn't recognise that 20 per cent of people infected would end up with severe critical illness. The evidence was there at the end of January.""A senior Whitehall official involved with Covid-19 planning held, however, that Dr Halpern was explaining the theory of ""herd immunity"", not advocating it. He said ""a lot will come out in the future about what happened, not just the role of advisers, but politicians as well, I have no doubt that a lot of it very interesting for the public"".",Newspaper; Web Publication

Communication breakdown 'reduces testing capacity by tens of thousands'                   A breakdown in communication between Public Health England PHE and the government's animal health agency may have reduced the UK's testing capacity by tens of thousands per week, it has been claimed.Employees at Animal and Plant Health Agency APHA have been in discussion with PHE for more than two months about supporting testing efforts, reports BuzzFeed News.The news website reports that they have seen evidence of PHE sending APHA, which tests diseases among animals, conflicting information about recruiting and training scientists.One APHA scientist told BuzzFeed News: ""We're not even getting a consistent message about what they want us to do,"" adding that the miscommunication with PHE was ""appalling"".                     'Herd immunity' strategy suggested by Government                   As the coronavirus outbreak began to worsen in early March members of the Government's 'nudge unit' appeared to favour a strategy of herd immunity.Dr David Halpern, a psychologist who heads the Behavioural Insights Team, said on BBC News: ""There's going to be a point, assuming the epidemic flows and grows, as we think it probably will do, where you'll want to cocoon, you'll want to protect those at-risk groups so that they basically don't catch the disease and by the time they come out of their cocooning, herd immunity's been achieved in the rest of the population.""To reach herd immunity, about 60% of the population would need to get ill and become immune, according to Sir Patrick Vallance, the government's chief scientific adviser.Martin Hibberd, professor of emerging infectious disease at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, said: ""I do worry that making plans that assume such a large proportion of the population will become infected and hopefully recovered and immune may not be the very best that we can do.""Within a week the 'herd immunity' strategy was scrapped and replaced with 'suppression' with social-distancing measures quickly ramped up.Speaking to BBC Newsnight former Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt, who had earlier criticised the 'herd immunity' strategy said: ""We changed our strategy a couple of weeks ago from the herd immunity strategy to the suppression strategy.""                     Government pledge to perform 10,000 tests a day                   On March 18 -roughly six weeks after the first confirmed case of Covid-19 in the UK -the Government pledged that 10,000 tests a day would be performed by the week after.That target was finally reached on April 1 when 10,657 tests were carried out.Also on March 18, the Government said that 25,000 tests a day would be carried out 'within four weeks'.There's no indication that they will be able to reach that target but today Prof Paul Cosford of Public Health England PHE said that testing would hit 15,000 per day ""imminently"".                     Government U-turn on the importance of testing                   Last week England's deputy chief medical officer Jenny Harries said: ""There comes a point in a pandemic when testing of every case is not an appropriate intervention and that is the point where we moved.""Although we still do some contact tracing and testing, for example in high-risk areas like prisons and care homes, that is not an appropriate mechanism as we go forward.""However in a video message on Twitter on Wednesday evening, Mr Johnson said that increased screening would be how the UK defeats the coronavirus.""I want to say a special word about testing, because it is so important, and as I have said for weeks and weeks, this is the way through,"" he said.""This is how we will unlock the coronavirus puzzle. This is how we will defeat it in the end.""At roughly the same time the prime minister's video was being posted on Twitter on Wednesday night, Jonathan Van Tam, also a deputy chief medical officer, told ITV's Robert Peston that testing was a ""side issue"" for reducing deaths.                     Muddled facts on NHS frontline staff testing                   On Wednesday the government said 2,000 NHS staff had been tested -despite claims more than 100,000 are off sick or self-isolating.On Thursday Downing Street clarified that the testing number was in fact higher than previously said.No10 said there were actually two strands of testing for NHS staff -drive-through tests, which have now tested 2,800 staff, plus testing within NHS labs of frontline staff.The government claimed that this second section has tested a ""significant number"" of NHS staff, but said the numbers will only be set out in full later on Thursday.Meanwhile, a new lab in Milton Keynes has now started taking samples from NHS staff, No10 claimed.Downing Street said nearly 100 universities, companies and research institutes agreed to lend their machines for the Milton Keynes effort and ""not a single institution that was asked refused"".                     Spare capacity to be used on NHS staff                   Government ministers said on Tuesday night that they would finally start using spare capacity to test NHS staff, after even the UK's limited testing capacity went unfilled despite enormous demand.It's understood the gap between coronavirus testing capacity and actual tests was due to a 15% cap on staff tests, with 85% reserved for patients.When medics were unable to fill the 85% patient quota, testing capacity went unused.With testing capacity increasing, Health Secretary Matt Hancock told the NHS to remove the cap, so all spare capacity can be used for staff and families from Wednesday.                     'Dunkirk-like effort' needed to increase test numbers dramatically                   Sir Paul Nurse, chief executive of the Francis Crick research institute -which will soon be able to conduct 500 Covid-19 tests a day -said a Dunkirk-style effort was needed to co-ordinate smaller laboratories and increase test numbers.""We are a lot of little boats and the little boats can be effective,"" he said, referring to the evacuation of Allied troops from the beaches of the French city during World War Two.He added: ""The government has put some big boats, destroyers in place. That's a bit more cumbersome to get working and we wish them all the luck to do that, but we little boats can contribute as well.""                                            A lack of materials and lab space                                        A global shortage of key chemicals called reagents is hampering the production of tests, No10 claimed this week. According to the British In Vitro Diagnostic Association, companies are working to meet demand, but the chemicals needed for different testing machines are different and the production complex. While reagent supply issues were sighted by Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, Michael Gove, as a reason for the slow production of tests, this claimed was thrown into doubt on Tuesday. The Chemical Industries Association, which represents the UK's substantial chemicals industry, told ITV that there was no shortage. What is certain however, is the fact that too little lab space has been designated for scientists to look at the tests. At first, Public Health England was only using its own eight laboratories. This has been expanded to 40 NHS labs, meaning 48 labs in total are now operational.                      No test is better than a bad test                   Professor Chris Whitty, England's chief medical officer, has issued a note of caution about rushing out tests that are not ready. ""One thing worse than no test is a bad test,"" arguing that an infected doctor or nurse falsely given the all clear could spread the virus through a large portion of a hospital. Some scientists have argued that the Government's stringent guidelines when it comes to testing standards, as well as types of reagents and chemicals, needed to be relaxed.""It is holding things up,"" Professor Nicola Stonehouse, a molecular virologist at Leeds University, told The Guardian.""If we could get over this, we could get the testing centres up and running so much faster, and that's got to be a good thing.""                     How is the Government planning to rectify this                    Today Matt Hancock said that he would be ""pressing the accelerator"" on coronavirus testing before unveiling a five-point plan that he claimed would see the UK eventually reach 100,000 tests a day.Part of the plan is to harness the capabilities of the UK private sector. In a conference call with manufacturers, inventors and commercial developers last night, the Health Secretary asked them to urgently create a major UK diagnostic capability, in line with that in Germany.When asked about the details of the plan, Prime Minister Boris Johnson's spokesman said that following complaints of shortages, the NHS had developed a new specification for the swabs used to carry out the tests which had been validated and shared with potential manufacturers.""We think that provides us with a way forward to complete hundreds of thousands of tests,"" he said.Following the opening of a large-scale testing laboratory in Milton Keynes in just a week, the spokesman said two more would be opening next week in Cheshire and Glasgow to cover the north of England and Scotland.At the same time, the spokesman said the Government was working with nine potential suppliers on developing an antibody test which would show whether people have had the virus.",Newspaper; Web Publication
274,"Public anger over price gouging is justified - but it could be damaging;The market fundamentalists are not entirely wrong to warn against the popular urge to stamp out price fluctuations, writes Ben Chu","April 2, 2020 Thursday",International,The Independent (United Kingdom),662,662,England & Wales,Ben Chu,"Public anger over price gouging is justified - but it could be damagingThe market fundamentalists are not entirely wrong to warn against the popular urge to stamp out price fluctuations, writes Ben Chu","In 1986 the behavioural economists Daniel Kahneman, Jack Knetsch and Richard Thaler published a classic study showing that in a hypothetical snow storm a large majority of people would think it unfair for a hypothetical hardware store to raise the price of a hypothetical snow shovel.Ordinary people don't like price gouging, was the finding.We don't need hypotheticals to tell us that in the grim age of coronavirus, or more specifically Covid-19.Just look at the backlash against Mike Ashley's attempt to hike the selling price of his weight-lifting equipment at his Sports Direct chain last month, shortly after the lockdown began.And new Office for National statistics data today shows that the online price of cough and cold medicines jumped by 10 per cent in a week last month, prompting            talk of profiteering by digital retailers and demands for a state crackdown.The reason why the Kahneman paper was well-known was because it was - to economists at least - problematic; another piece of that famous corpus of behavioural research showing that people don't think and behave according to the axioms of old-fashioned economic textbooks.Economists generally believe that markets work because prices are allowed to reflect the balance of supply and demand.So if the demand for snow shovels surges in a snowstorm it's natural for the price to rise to reflect that - welcome even because it transmits a signal to snow shovel manufacturers to produce more of them. Or because it incentivises others to put their own stocks up for sale.Prices and price changes are information and if you interfere with the flow of information you're going to get inefficiency.What this misses, of course, is context.People who would, in normal times, be content to see the retail price of a snow shovel fluctuate, perhaps reflecting the costs of production of the manufacturer, feel very differently about the shop owner who whacks up prices in a time of perceived social emergency in order to make a profit - and especially so when it involves goods that are seen as essential such as medicines.Markets are embedded in societies. And societies - people - care about fairness.For free market fundamentalists and libertarian commentators to rail against this reality is the economic equivalent of howling at the moon.There's clearly a justification for fairness consideration to trump efficiency in this pandemic, certainly when it comes to anything related to health.Yet the market fundamentalists are not entirely wrong to warn against the popular urge to stamp out price fluctuations.Coronavirus: Choristers sing during lockdown in SomersetWartime-style direction of industrial production works up to a point.The Government can requisition private businesses to convert their factories to produce ventilators rather than cars. The state can            transform conference centres into field hospitals.But total state control of the economy, even in a health emergency like this one, is neither feasible nor desirable.It's generally agreed that we want private businesses to survive this crisis, not least so they can continue to employ workers rather than having to make them redundant en masse. But if we hammer firms' profits margins in the name of fairness we risk undermining this goal.Happily, it's likely that most people understand this. One of the perhaps more interesting findings of the Kahneman paper was that a majority of those questioned were willing to accept price rises (and wage cuts) from firms when the firm was in danger of going bust. Context matters.So how do we apply all that now?As so often, it's a balance. Market regulators and the government need to judge when to intervene and when to let the market operate. Businesses need to judge what's socially acceptable behaviour when it comes to pricing and what isn't.It's won't be easy. But relative to the other agonising dilemmas thrown up by the coronavirus pandemic it's not the hardest job either.",Newspaper; Web Publication

""People don't make bad decisions on purpose - perhaps the seriousness of the situation wasn't being understood across government at that time.""Although we will never know, the Atlético Madrid game could have been one of the cultural events and gatherings that influenced the rise in Liverpool. It is definitely one to be included on the list for learning and for a future inquiry, so that organisations can learn and not make similar mistakes.""On 11 March, the day of the last-16 second-leg match, which was won 3-2 by Atlético and attended by 54,000 people, including 3,000 away supporters, Liverpool had just six confirmed cases of coronavirus. Madrid had by then become a centre for the spread of the virus. La Liga decided that day that all matches must be played behind closed doors and Spain's government had ordered schools closed the day before. In Britain the government was still pursuing its policy of allowing life to continue with no restrictions other than advising people who believed they had Covid-19 symptoms to self-isolate.Dr David Halpern, chief executive of the governmental behavioural insights team, first publicly mentioned the term ""herd immunity"" that day, suggesting that the majority of the population could be allowed to contract Covid-19 while people most vulnerable to the virus might be isolated. All major events such as football matches, described as ""mass gatherings"", were still scheduled to go ahead. The government changed the policy and began to announce social distancing restrictions the following Monday, 16 March.Joel Rookwood, a senior lecturer in sport business management at the University of Central Lancashire, and a Liverpool supporter, has been suffering severely from the symptoms of Covid-19 since 14 March, although he has not been in hospital so has not been tested for the virus. He was at the Atlético match, and believes he contracted the virus at the game.Writing about his experience in his local newspaper, the Lancashire Evening Post, Rookwood, 39, said he had feared he would be vulnerable if he contracted the virus because he has twice been hospitalised with pneumonia. For days since the match he has suffered from ""acute shortness of breath and violent episodes of rigor (shaking). I haven't eaten solid food or been fully horizontal for 10 days. Precious periods of sleep are counted in minutes, not hours."" He did call 111 last weekend when his condition deteriorated, but was told he was 280th in the queue for an ambulance, and he was not considered critical enough for that to be accelerated.Scientific advice to the government at the time of the match, and the way it was communicated by ministers, made a distinction between ""mass gatherings"" outdoors, which are said to involve a lower risk of infection, and people meeting inside, in pubs and bars, where the risk of transmission is greater. That appeared to overlook the glaring reality that a mega-event such as Liverpool's Champions League game involves multiple intense indoor gatherings as well; the old Victorian pubs around Anfield were packed for hours that night, as were the club's bars, shop, concourses, toilets, entertainment and working areas. Even out on the Kop, Rookwood points out that on such a tumultuous football night there was a great deal of close contact.Yet despite the pandemic beginning to take hold in Britain then, he recalls no allowances being made for it: ""There were queues and groups everywhere. Pubs were packed, friends greeted each other with the customary contact, fans gathered in condensed queues and stood or sat together in close proximity ... The celebrations that night were very physical, shared experiences.""Prof Neil Ferguson, leader of the Imperial College team of scientists advising the government, said that their advice on mass outdoor gatherings did acknowledge that people would also gather indoors at pubs and bars.""The issue is that people spend a very small amount of their time during the week at a mass gathering. It is not that mass gatherings don't contribute at all [to the spread of a virus] but that at a population level, stopping them has a marginal impact.""The issue of allowing Madrid supporters to travel was a separate government decision about restrictions from any particular country - which did not apply from Spain at the time, Ferguson said. ""Some people will have got infected,"" he said of the transmission potential of mass gatherings, ""and if it hadn't happened they wouldn't have been."" However he maintains that stopping sporting events, rather than closing schools and maintaining the very restrictive measures now in place, would not have had ""a major impact on the spread of the epidemic"".Prof John Ashton, the former regional director of public health for north-west England - who is Matthew Ashton's father - sounded the alarm about the government's approach and staging the Liverpool match at the time and he maintains it was wrong to host it.Accepting that without widespread testing the real number of Covid-19 cases is unknown, and it is impossible to be sure where people were infected, he says, nevertheless: ""Bringing 3,000 supporters from a very high-incidence area was basically just wrong, and the view that open-air events don't pose a threat is really simplistic. I hope I am wrong, but I believe that people were put in harm's way that night.""",Newspaper
276,Warnings of quarantine 'rebellion' as car use rises;Coronavirus ; Social isolation,"April 2, 2020 Thursday",International,The Daily Telegraph (London),1450,1450,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,Hayley Dixon,Warnings of quarantine 'rebellion' as car use risesCoronavirus ; Social isolation,"BRITAIN'S fragile quarantine began to give some experts cause for concern last night, as figures showed an ""uptick"" in the number of people using transport.The total of those using their cars and public transport, which had been consistently dropping since strict social distancing measures were introduced, rose for the first time at the beginning of this week.It is feared that the sunny forecast for the weekend, which could see temperatures of 68F (20C) in London, will prompt more people to break the rules and go outside and socialise as the Easter holidays begin.Mervyn King, the former Governor of the Bank of England, warned that there could be a ""rebellion"" if the measures are enforced for too long.Many self-employed people who have been told that they will not receive money from the Government until June now feel that they have no choice but to return to work, a government adviser told The Daily Telegraph. It came as Alok Sharma, the Business Secretary, said that he recognised ""the extreme disruption"" to people's lives but warned a ""dangerous"" second peak could develop if they were lifted early.""People will understand across the country why we have put these restrictions in place and the Prime Minister was very clear they were for an initial three-week period and we would review them,"" he told a press conference. ""But what's also really important is that if we stop these too quickly, there is a possibility that that massive effort people have made across the country is wasted and we could potentially see a dangerous second peak. We absolutely want to avoid that.""Police-enforced restrictions on movement mean people can only leave their house to exercise, shop for essential items or go to work if they cannot work from home.Lord King said it was ""unrealistic"" to think the lockdown could continue for ""months and months on end"" and called for a gradual exit strategy to protect the economy and citizens' wellbeing.Data released from the Department of Transport showed that after consistently dropping from March 23 when the lockdown was announced, the number of people travelling on buses and tubes in London rose slightly on March 30. The numbers of those using their cars and vans rose by 10 per cent on the same day, from 27 per cent of normal levels on the Sunday to 37 per cent on Monday.Professor Yvonne Doyle, medical director of Public Health England, described the ""uptick in motor vehicle traffic"" as a ""slightly concerning trend"".Professor Susan Michie, director of the Centre for Behaviour Change at University College London and a member of the Scientific Pandemic Influenza Group on Behavioural Science which advises the Government, said people going to work still make up around 30 per cent of the trips outside the home.Describing the figure as ""quite a concern"", she said that one group of people who are still working is the five million self-employed who will not receive any money until June under support measures announced by the Chancellor last week. ""A lot of them, because of their circumstances, will carry on working. They have families to feed and they have no money coming in and that is a really urgent issue,"" Prof Michie told The Daily Telegraph.She also raised concerns that a lot of people were going to workplaces where social distancing measures were not being enforced.""We know that adherence [to lockdown] gets worse as time goes on generally, but is also worse among people who are financially insecure or on low incomes and also among those who are worried about access to provisions such as food or water,"" she said.Prof Michie said that the Government now needs to get on the ""front foot"" and incentivise people to stay at home. ""We are only a week in and it is important to think about the problems that are likely to start as time goes on.""There are financial and practical pressures, issues of boredom, frustration, depression and for people living on their own, loneliness. Those things increase over time and even more so for people in financially insecure circumstances,"" she said.She added that as time goes on people might lose the ""motivation"" to stay indoors and ""as the weather gets better more and more people will want to be outside"".Professor John Ashton, former president of the Faculty of Public Health, said that compliance with the lockdown is dependent on trust and ""trust in the Government is fairly low because they have failed to be open and transparent from the beginning"".""I said from the outset that they need to take the public with them but they were treating people like children,"" Prof Ashton said. ""If you want people to behave like adults then you have to treat them like adults.""He said that among problems with the Government response to the pandemic has been a failure to be honest about testing capability, personal protective equipment and sharing data, even among medical professionals.""I think [there] is a danger that the lockdown might not stick,"" Prof Ashton said. He said that one way in which the Government could help enforce the measures was to roll out testing, which would allow the restrictions to be altered according to need.A government spokesman added: ""Our message is clear - people should stay at home. This will save lives, protect the vulnerable and protect the NHS. The restrictive measures the PM announced last week remain in place. Police across the UK have the powers they need to enforce these where necessary.""A National Police Chiefs' Council spokesman said that they had seen an ""overwhelming response"" to the lockdown measures last weekend and are hopeful that the public will continue to abide by the rules this weekend.Fighting back How different countries are restricting people to combat the pandemic Britain The public are asked to stay at home and only leave the house when shopping for necessities, to do one form of exercise, to provide care or help a vulnerable person, or when travelling to and from work where necessary. Officers can give on-the-spot fines of £60, reduced to £30 if paid within 14 days. France The French have been in home confinement since March 17 with all but those in vital jobs ordered to stay indoors. Anyone going out must carry a form justifying their reasons. Fines for breaches start at (EURO)135 (£117).Italy Under Italy's rigid quarantine regime, people are only allowed out if they are going to work, collecting medicine or shopping for essential food. Spain Citizens can only go out alone to buy food, seek medical care, for emergencies or to work in essential industries. It tightened its lockdown, ordering all non-essential workers to stay at home for the next two weeks. Germany There is no nationwide curfew but more than two people cannot be outside together unless part of the same household. Going for a walk with a friend is fine, but groups of three or more are forbidden. Belgium Belgians must stay indoors and only go out for essential reasons. Gatherings are banned. Travelling for work can only be done with a certificate. The Netherlands People are urged to stay at home. They can leave to go to work if they cannot work from home, to buy groceries or to take care of others. Events of three people or more, who are not from the same household, are banned until June 1. Brazil The health ministry has recommended municipalities cancel events in confined places, declare early school holidays and quarantine if the occupancy of ICU beds gets to 80 per cent. Sweden Sweden adopted a laissez-faire approach early on, but has since toughened up, with bars, cafés, restaurants and nightclubs told to offer seated table service only; events of over 50 people are banned. America US Federal guidelines on social distancing recommend people stay at home and avoid social gatherings of more than 10. It recommends to avoid eating or drinking out, ""discretionary travel"" and visiting nursing homes.Singapore The country has a strict home quarantine and an exhaustive contact-tracing programme. Those who do not stay at home when required can expect a fine or up to six months in jail. India India has limited the movement of its population for 21 days. The lockdown was ordered after a 14-hour voluntary public curfew on March 22, followed by enforcement of regulations in affected regions. Australia The country has imposed home confinement and a 14-day quarantine rule for foreigners, with maximum penalties for breaching them ranging from a A$50,000 (£24,200) fine to six months' jail time.South Africa Restricted people to their homes for most activities, only permitting excursions for buying food or emergencies.

277,How major cities around the world ground to a halt amid the coronavirus pandemic;Once thriving city hubs have fallen quiet in just one month as communities attempt to stave off the encroaching virus.,"April 2, 2020 Thursday",International,telegraph.co.uk,1189,1189,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,"By Dominic Gilbert, Data Journalist",How major cities around the world ground to a halt amid the coronavirus pandemicOnce thriving city hubs have fallen quiet in just one month as communities attempt to stave off the encroaching virus.,"Life has come to a standstill in major cities across Europe as countries go into a coronavirus paralysis.Over the course of just 31 days in March traffic and movement around many capital cities has halted, as it becomes restricted to only necessary travel, exercise and work.While many European countries have now imposed nation-wide lockdowns, their citizens had begun observing strict restrictions on their movement long before in many cases.But some have been slower to act than others, according to the latest data on population movements over the last month.Italians began the month in the midst of the epidemic.By March 4 the country had seen its 100th coronavirus death. The next day the United Kingdom recorded its first. So by the beginning of March, northern Italy was already restricting its movement according to data from the Citymapper Mobility Index.On March 1 just 45 per cent of Milan was moving compared to its daily average, ten days before nation-wide lockdowns were put into force, and a week before northern Italy was quarantined.At the time London, Berlin, Paris and Madrid, among others, were going about life almost as normal-around 100 per cent of the average planned journeys.By the end of March, few cities were operating above 10% of their average, after the pandemic took hold and people ordered into their homes.The timing of lockdowns has had an impact on movement, but most came into force when cities were already moving at less than 30 per cent of their average.The UK was one of the last countries in Europe to impose restrictions on movement-on March 23.It meant significant reductions in travel (below 10 per cent of the average) came later in the UK.Rome reduced its movement by 90 percentage points in 12 days, below 10% of average by March 13.Barcelona moved from 104 per cent to eight per cent in just nine days, while Paris reduced its travel from 101 per cent to eight per cent in 16 days.In London it took 22 days to reduce movement to a tenth of normal levels, and Birmingham and Manchester were still operating above that margin (16 per cent and 13 per cent) by the end of March.                     'Concerning uptick' in UK                   Data released from the Department of Transport has showed that after consistently dropping from March 23, when the lockdown was announced, the number of people travelling on buses and Tubes in London rose slightly on March 30.The numbers of those using their cars and vans rose by 10 per cent on the same day, from 27 per cent of normal levels on the Sunday to 37 per cent on Monday.Professor Yvonne Doyle, Medical Director of Public Health England, described the ""uptick in motor vehicle traffic"" as a ""slightly concerning trend"".Professor Susan Michie, director of the Centre for Behaviour Change at University College London and a member of the Scientific Pandemic Influenza Group on Behavioural Science which advises the Government, said people going to work still make up around 30 per cent of the trips outside the home.A Government spokesman said: ""Our message is clear - people should stay at home. This will save lives, protect the vulnerable and protect the NHS. The restrictive measures the PM announced last week remain in place. Police across the UK have the powers they need to enforce these where necessary.""George Batchelor, of Edge Health, said: ""What remains to be seen is whether this is enough to offset the spreading of the disease that happens within families, the health system and key workers.""We have not yet started to see the growth of new cases slow significantly like we have in Italy, although all the indicators are pointing to this happening in the next week.""                      Empty skies                   Travel analyst OAG has estimated globally, air capacity has been cut by 35 per cent.But with many airlines flying with thousands of empty seats, the decline in actual passenger numbers is likely to be far higher. And in some of the busiest airports around the world, the number of flights has been cut by as much as 95 per cent, according to data from flight trackers, FlightRadar24.In Barcelona's El Prat airport, the number of flights being tracked has fallen by 95 per cent to just 20 per day after the EU closed its borders to non-citizens. Similar trends are taking place in Paris' Charles de Gaulle and Madrid's Barajas.Europe's largest low-cost carrier has grounded more than 90 per cent of its fleet and it only keeping a handful of flights running for ""emergency reasons"". On March 30, it said these routes would operate until April 9. An open letter from Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary states: ""Any passenger whose fight has been cancelled as a result of these Government shutdowns, will over the next week or two, receive an email outlining their options.""According to John Grant, senior analyst at OAG, the scale of the global aviation shutdown is unprecedented. ""This has never been seen before, and the impact not just on aviation but global trade will be immense,"" he said.""Furthermore, it has the potential to go deeper before any shoots of recovery appear. It's really a matter of time for some markets that are less impacted to see the same results as we are now seeing in Europe.""For many airlines, he added, collapse could be ""weeks away"".                      Are the lockdowns working?                   China has announced it will finally be ending lockdown in Wuhan on April 8, a huge milestone for the country and a signal that the crisis-for them at least-is nearing its end.The city in Hubei province was the epicentre of the coronavirus outbreak.Yet it took more than two months of extremely draconian restrictions, including travel bans and quarantine zones, to achieve the level of containment seen in Wuhan. China enforced lockdowns relatively early while they grappled with the virus. It was only on January 7 the new strain of coronavirus-Covid-19-was identified.Less than three weeks later Hubei province was under lockdown and the government was busy shutting down neighbouring provinces.While many other countries employed a 'contain' strategy to keep the virus at bay, they did not enforce restrictions on travel or social distancing.It meant full-scale societal interventions were not put in place for more than a month.Spain and Belgium did not lock down for 43 days after their first case, while the UK, Germany and France did not impose quarantines until the virus had been in those countries for more than 53 days. Italy locked down faster than most in Europe-39 days after the first case was identified, and Spain's came three days later, on March 14.Both countries are now seeing signs of the number of cases slowing.Spain's new cases hit a high of 8,500 on March 27, before levelling off and falling as low as 6,300 on March 31. It has since risen again to more than 9,000, but the rate of increase has slowed.To date the most new cases Italy has seen in a single day is just over 6,500. Since then the number has fallen day to day, and is now averaging just over 4,000 each day.The numbers began to fall 12 days after the country went into national quarantine.",Newspaper; Web Publication
278,How I helped build a coronavirus chatbot for the NHS in just days,"April 2, 2020 Thursday",International,telegraph.co.uk,629,629,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,By Peter Bach,How I helped build a coronavirus chatbot for the NHS in just days,"I was privileged enough to run a large team of digital artists on Danny Boyle's popular virus horror film 28 Days Later. Twenty years later, I never expected to be one of six volunteers helping fight an actual virus.Despite the red tape of a government and NHS still reeling from the crisis, we have put together in a matter of days a user-friendly chatbot - a bot is a quick-access data gatherer - which has now been officially embraced. We can encompass entire populations without crashing. The idea was hatched just a week ago. That was when conflict advisor James Fennell posted on Facebook about the need for such a thing. He wanted me to reach out to my contacts from a film I made about the NHS. Marketing strategist George Cooke saw Fennell's online call to bots and jumped on board. Through him volunteer Jani Laakso from a top Finnish company became involved. The team to build the bot was in place and everyone was still doing everything for free.I contacted public health professor Allyson Pollock who knew there would be a glut of app-based ideas. She suggested Public Health England (PHE) and the World Health Organisation (WHO). ""I think China and South Korea have already been developing these,"" she warned.This was when the Cabinet Office declared an interest. It was unusual to be sharing emails with six members of the Cabinet Office and one at Number 10.A neighbour meanwhile was rushed to Queen Elizabeth Hospital on Woolwich Common. This was no game.What we are attempting to do should not be confused with apps popping up everywhere. As a bot, we can get very large quantities of well-presented ""dirty"" data that will go directly to crisis managers. ""A surveillance tool for managing the crisis rather than a data collection tool supporting research or clinical diagnosis,"" explained Fennell as the bot was being built.It's all about pressing the right buttons. Location, sex, basic info, whether self-isolating or not. Something that works on any device. No download required. A national survey if you like. Just as we were about to launch, NHSX revealed a brand new app less easily accessed than a bot. The Cabinet Office and MOD appeared keen for us to go ahead. The SAGE sub-group, the Scientific Pandemic Influenza Group on Behavioural Science (SPI-B), now wanted to be across our different data strands in order to inform their discussions.We did a soft launch last week and will alter it as it goes along.The technology has been built for the benefit of others. We are not collecting personal data. There are no data breaches. We see ourselves as a mobilising force and aid to coordination.BBC reports of NHS Digital (NHSX) using expensive giants like Microsoft, Faculty AI and Google's G Suiteas a single source of truth was riling to some of us. We only saw the need for info now, not next week. Why was a tight group of six volunteers able to turn around in days something that not only the NHS have struggled to deliver but Whitehall and, to a smaller degree, the MoD? It is a mixture of the fleet-footedness that the four of us have learned in war zones as well as the tech and film sectors. We know how to cut through the red tape quickly and our technologists are from an extremely generous start-up, without the corporate inertia so often afflicting large multinationals.Today's NHS is party to many corporate fiefdoms and ours belongs to nobody. Its inception was inspired by national emergency, not corporate cunning. ""Or requirements for time-wasting contracting procedures,"" said Fennell. The bot is essentially selfless.In 28 Days Later there were few survivors. It is certainly the dream of this small band of volunteers not to let that happen here.

279,Are enough people being tested for coronavirus?,"April 2, 2020 Thursday",International,The Independent (United Kingdom),1087,1087,England & Wales,HARRY COCKBURN,Are enough people being tested for coronavirus?,"Three months have passed since the World Health Organisation (WHO) was first made aware, on 31 December 2019, of a previously unknown virus causing pneumonia among patients in the city of Wuhan in eastern China.Just one month after these first reports, on the 31 January 2020, the first Covid-19 cases were confirmed in the UK, as the virus spread from China to countries across the planet.Two months after this, the UK is in lockdown and the disease has gone on to infect an estimated 1.7 million people and killed more than 2,300.The numbers are still climbing.But unlike many other countries fighting the virus, the UK has not rolled out widespread testing. So are the authorities here doing enough?1. How have other countries responded to the coronavirus threat?The disease has spread to more than 200 countries and territories, killing tens of thousands of people, with the US, Italy and Spain recording more cases and more deaths than China.In its efforts to stop the deadly pandemic, the World Health Organisation has told countries to ""test, test, test"".The world was stunned when China locked down first the entire city of Wuhan, and later the entire province of Hubei, as it sought to contain the virus. Such an enormous quarantine plan had never before been attempted in the modern world, but by the middle of March, Beijing's decision appeared to be vindicated as cases tumbled rapidly, then stopped.South Korea, which was hit early with a cluster of cases, embarked on the world's most ambitious virus-testing programme ever seen. By the beginning of March, the country was able to test 20,000 people a day and implemented stringent tracing efforts to track down people who had been in contact with those known to be infected.To date, South Korea has had 9,887 confirmed cases and 165 deaths, making its death rate 1 per cent, compared to a global death rate of 3.4 per cent.In Germany, 70,000 people a day are now being tested for the disease, and the death rate is under 1 per cent. A similar rate has also been seen in Austria where intense testing is underway.Even America, which under Donald Trump has been slow to accept the impact of the disease, is now testing more people per capita than the UK.Mr Trump even criticised Boris Johnson personally for the UK's response to the crisis during a televised address this week.2. How many people are being tested in the UK?In the UK, the government has been accused of failing to prepare in the face of incessant warnings, and over the weekend failed to hit its own stated target of testing 10,000 people a day. Fewer than 5,000 individual patients were tested for the disease on Saturday.Fewer than 153,000 people have been tested for the virus to date, according to figures released on Wednesday.The result is the government is now coming under even greater pressure over current levels of testing, as the UK experienced its biggest day-on-day rise in deaths so far.Ministers have said the UK is now aiming to test 25,000 people a day by the middle of April.3. Why are numbers lower than might be expected?Earlier in March, as the UK government pursued its controversial plans to only test people admitted to hospital, delayed closing schools, and banning large gatherings citing concerns over ""behavioural fatigue"" if too many restrictions came in too early, other countries and global bodies looked on in disbelief.When tactics changed later in the month, the UK found itself at the back of a long queue for essential equipment.Asked why the UK was only testing around 8,000 people a day while Germany was working on about 70,000 a day, Mr Johnson's official spokesman said on Monday there have been difficulties in ""getting all the equipment they need to conduct these tests at a time when everybody in the world wants them"".4. What does it mean for health workers?The lack of testing equipment in Britain has even meant essential frontline medical staff have been unable to be tested for the virus, resulting in those with Covid-19-like symptoms being forced to self-isolate, when many of them may not in fact have the disease, thereby reducing the already critically low numbers of doctors, nurses and healthcare workers.On Wednesday, healthcare leaders warned there still remains ""no immediate prospect"" of mass NHS staff testing.NHS trusts were told earlier this week they may only use up to 15 per cent of any spare testing capacity for NHS staff.But Health Secretary Matt Hancock has now scrapped that cap, telling NHS hospital labs to use all spare capacity to test their frontline workers.5. What is being done to increase testing in the UK?The UK is currently working towards a target of testing 25,000 people a day within the next three weeks.The 25,000 figure comes despite promises made last week by NHS medical director Professor Stephen Powis who said there would be ""hundreds of thousands of tests"" a day within the next few weeks.Chris Hopson, the chief executive of NHS Providers, which represents NHS trusts, told the Press Association this week maximum testing capacity in the UK was currently ""very constrained"" and only able to deliver around 13,000 tests per day.The focus remains on testing patients in hospital to see if they have Covid-19, rather than the wider public.Public Health England has also come under fire over its stance on wider testing of members of the public for the virus.The organisation has repeatedly said most adults in good health who develop symptoms will fully recover and do not need to be tested.However, many scientists disagree and say it is only through widespread testing the UK will be able to emerge from lockdown.On Tuesday, former WHO director Professor Anthony Costello criticised the UK's response to the crisis, saying the country does have the capacity to test hundreds of thousands more people.He said: ""By mass testing, we can detect new outbreaks and there will be much less disruption rather than isolating the whole economy.""We have 44 molecular virology labs in the UK. If they were doing 400 tests a day, we would be up to Germany levels of testing (around 70,000 a day) and that is perfectly feasible.""He warned a rapid acceleration was the only way for the UK to avoid a painful six months before society ""returns to normal"", as the public was warned on Sunday.""We must go to mass testing and, when we remove the lockdown, I don't think it will take six months. All the Asian states - it was six to eight weeks of being able to lift the lockdown,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.",Newspaper
280,Are enough people being tested for Covid-19?,"April 2, 2020 Thursday",International,The Independent (United Kingdom),1087,1087,England & Wales,HARRY COCKBURN,Are enough people being tested for Covid-19?,"Three months have passed since the World Health Organisation (WHO) was first made aware, on 31 December 2019, of a previously unknown virus causing pneumonia among patients in the city of Wuhan in eastern China.Just one month after these first reports, on the 31 January 2020, the first Covid-19 cases were confirmed in the UK, as the virus spread from China to countries across the planet.Two months after this, the UK is in lockdown and the disease has gone on to infect an estimated 1.7 million people and killed more than 2,300.The numbers are still climbing.But unlike many other countries fighting the virus, the UK has not rolled out widespread testing. So are the authorities here doing enough?1. How have other countries responded to the coronavirus threat?The disease has spread to more than 200 countries and territories, killing tens of thousands of people, with the US, Italy and Spain recording more cases and more deaths than China.In its efforts to stop the deadly pandemic, the World Health Organisation has told countries to ""test, test, test"".The world was stunned when China locked down first the entire city of Wuhan, and later the entire province of Hubei, as it sought to contain the virus. Such an enormous quarantine plan had never before been attempted in the modern world, but by the middle of March, Beijing's decision appeared to be vindicated as cases tumbled rapidly, then stopped.South Korea, which was hit early with a cluster of cases, embarked on the world's most ambitious virus-testing programme ever seen. By the beginning of March, the country was able to test 20,000 people a day and implemented stringent tracing efforts to track down people who had been in contact with those known to be infected.To date, South Korea has had 9,887 confirmed cases and 165 deaths, making its death rate 1 per cent, compared to a global death rate of 3.4 per cent.In Germany, 70,000 people a day are now being tested for the disease, and the death rate is under 1 per cent. A similar rate has also been seen in Austria where intense testing is underway.Even America, which under Donald Trump has been slow to accept the impact of the disease, is now testing more people per capita than the UK.Mr Trump even criticised Boris Johnson personally for the UK's response to the crisis during a televised address this week.2. How many people are being tested in the UK?In the UK, the government has been accused of failing to prepare in the face of incessant warnings, and over the weekend failed to hit its own stated target of testing 10,000 people a day. Fewer than 5,000 individual patients were tested for the disease on Saturday.Fewer than 153,000 people have been tested for the virus to date, according to figures released on Wednesday.The result is the government is now coming under even greater pressure over current levels of testing, as the UK experienced its biggest day-on-day rise in deaths so far.Ministers have said the UK is now aiming to test 25,000 people a day by the middle of April.3.

281,"Coronavirus: Boris Johnson ignored expert evidence over pandemic, says ex-chief scientific adviser;'We did all the work that needed to be done - we did prepare the ground'","April 2, 2020 Thursday",International,The Independent (United Kingdom),464,464,England & Wales,Rob Merrick,"Coronavirus: Boris Johnson ignored expert evidence over pandemic, says ex-chief scientific adviser'We did all the work that needed to be done - we did prepare the ground'","                     Boris Johnson ignored expert evidence on preventing a pandemic when he failed to crack down early enough on coronavirus, a former chief scientific adviser says.In a devastating attack, David King also warned that ""underfunding"" of the NHS by the Tories had undermined efforts to fight back against the outbreak and save lives.Highlighting planning he did more than a decade ago, Sir David said: ""We did all the work that needed to be done - we did prepare the ground.""The prime minister delayed introducing the near-lockdown for crucial weeks, even as other countries imposed tough restrictions as the crisis unfolded in China.But Sir David said: ""We did, for example, a calculation to show that - wherever this virus appeared in world - within 3 to 6 months it would be in every country of the world.""Well, we have just seen that play out. This began in China in December - it is now virtually everywhere.""Speaking to Sky News, the chief scientific adviser between 2000 and 2008 added: ""We know that what we should have done, early on, is take all sorts of precautionary measures to see that the virus did not get to the level it is now in this country, once we had seen what was happening in China.""But the response has been slow and, I think, because our National Health Service has suffered from underfunding from that 2010 period.""The comments come amid the first signs of public concern about the government's handling of the crisis, despite the prime minister's sky-high poll ratings.According to the survey by Ipsos MORI, 56 per cent believe the social distancing measures were imposed too late, while just four per cent believed they were brought in too soon. It came as the latest official figures showed that 2,921 people have died after contracting the virus in the UK while over 33,000 have tested positive.It was only 10 days ago that Mr Johnson said people should only leave their homes to buy groceries, to exercise once a day or to travel to work if absolutely necessary.Three days earlier, he ordered pubs, bars, restaurants, theatres, cafes and leisure centres to close - having earlier stepped back from doing so.Throughout, ministers have insisted they have followed the advice of their scientists, but that disguises the U-turn when the strategy of aiming for so-called 'herd immunity' in the population was abandoned.The apparent plan to allow the disease to spread among healthier people is blamed for the delays in ordering sufficient testing.Critics say the government ignored public health experts and doctors in favour of behavioural scientists and mathematical modellers.Sir David highlighted the very different approach when the SARS outbreak hit Taiwan, in 2003, when an Imperial College expert was sent immediately to view its impact.",Newspaper; Web Publication
282,"How long will the UK coronavirus lockdown last?;Less than 12 hours after the Prime Minister's historic address to the nation, the London Underground was still jammed with commuters","April 2, 2020 Thursday",International,telegraph.co.uk,1348,1348,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,"By Sarah Knapton, Science Editor","How long will the UK coronavirus lockdown last?Less than 12 hours after the Prime Minister's historic address to the nation, the London Underground was still jammed with commuters","Boris Johnson took the unprecedented step of curtailing individual freedoms to prevent the further spread of            coronavirus.The Prime Minister said that measures would be in place for three weeks-until April 13-and then reviewed. But given the expected trajectory of the disease, and the decisions taken by other countries who are ahead of Britain in terms of virus progression, it is unlikely the restrictions will be lifted then.•What the UK lockdown means for youFor a start, compared to most countries, the UK had a porous and half-hearted beginning to its isolation measures, with seemingly few people choosing to stay inside. Less than 12 hours after the Prime Minister's historic address to the nation on March 23, the London Underground was jammed with commuters (see video below), while builders were seen eating together in communal canteens, making a mockery of the Government's rule that no more than two people can gather together in public.Professor Susan Michie, Director of the University College London's Centre for Behaviour Change, warned that some people would simply not be able to carry out the measures, even if they wanted to.""Five million self-employed people are being left potentially destitute by the Government failing to offer financial supportas they have done for directly employed workers,"" she said. ""Since [statutory sick pay of] £94 is not enough to pay rent, bills, food for a family etc, they will be forced to carry on as usual.""The British Transport Police is now on hand to make sure only            critical workers are using the London Underground. But such an inauspicious start to the lockdown suggests the virus will spread further than it would have, had stricter measures been implemented earlier,            as they have in other countries. And it means that the measures we do have are likely to be in place for longer to ""flatten the curve"" in a way that would prevent a second dangerous peak.In addition, on April 1 the Government revealed figures that suggested the lockdown was starting to fray as data showed an ""uptick""            in the number of people using transport.The number of those using their cars and public transport, which had been consistently dropping since strict social distancing measures were introduced, rose for the first time.It is feared that sunny weather will prompt more people to break the rules and go outside and socialise as the Easter holidays begin.Mervyn King, the former Governor of the Bank of England, warned that there could be a ""rebellion"" if the measures are enforced for too long. Meanwhile, China has announced it will           finally be ending lockdown in Wuhanon April 8, a huge milestone for the country and a signal that the crisis-for them at least-is nearing its end. The city in Hubei province was the epicentre of the coronavirus outbreak.Yet it took more than two months of extremely draconian restrictions, including travel bans and quarantine zones, to achieve the level of containment seen in Wuhan. Britain is nowhere near that level of lockdown.And the Chinese restrictions were not lifted for more than 12 weeks after the first death, so if Britain follows a similar path, ours may need to be in place until the end of May/early June. Certainly, that is when the Government has said it expects cases to peak and then level out.However, from papers released recently, we know the Government is at least considering restricting movement for the rest of the year.The Scientific Pandemic Influenza Group on Modelling, which feeds into the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), proposed that because of the length of the outbreak, parts of the country could be placed in six-month lockdowns at a time, before being allowed more freedom. Professor Rowland Kao, the Sir Timothy O'Shea Professor of Veterinary Epidemiology and Data Science at the University of Edinburgh, said: ""It must be hoped that such measures will only last a relatively short time.""However, we must be prepared for this not to be the case, and for them to be in place for an extended period.""The next weeks until the Prime Minister's review will be crucial, as the unfolding epidemic will now be seen in real time, rather than through modelling, allowing experts to make more accurate predictions of when it will peak, and finally die away. It is also possible that after three weeks it becomes apparent that the costs to shutting down society far outweigh the benefit of slowing the spread and the government may choose to lift restrictions even before the peak.•Listen to the daily podcastProfessor Mark Woolhouse, Professor of Infectious Disease Epidemiology, University of Edinburgh, said: ""We now enter a phase of careful monitoring. We are looking for indicators first that the epidemic is slowing down and then for numbers of new cases to start to fall. ""After three weeks we will have to decide whether the restrictions need to be continued, can be relaxed, or can be relaxed temporarily with the expectation of imposing them again later. ""We must also monitor the damage that the lockdown is doing; damage to the economy, to education, to psychological well-being and to health and social care provision in the community. The impacts of this epidemic are too far reaching for policy decisions to be driven by epidemiology alone.""There are also hints that countries in Europe may be on a slightly faster course than China, and may peak sooner, meaning restrictions could be lifted earlier. While cases in China peaked some 72 days after the first recorded infections, public health officials in both Germany and Italy believe that they are starting to see a plateauing now, which could mean a peak of around 57 and 53 days respectively.Earlier this week, the Prime Minister said that we are two weeks behind Italy so Britain may end up peaking by the beginning of April. China left lockdown restrictions in place for nearly a month after the peak, so it is possible restrictions could be lifted early in May.Professor Sheila Bird said that more cases in coming days and weeks would make it easier for the Government to predict how the epidemic is responding to lockdown measures, which will inform how long they remain in place. ""Once an epidemic takes hold, as now in UK, the country's own data - properly reported and interpreted - take precedence over modelling as the data tell us the actual toll which the epidemic is exacting,"" she said.""A huge amount can be inferred about the immediately forthcoming weeks from these data directly, including whether further policy changes are needed to reinforce social-distancing; for example in particular age groups.""Some experts are still concerned that the current restrictions do not go far enough while others say the government has been hit by an ""epidemic of action"", and is now bringing in measures that have little rationale. Professor Robert Dingwall, Professor of Sociology, at Nottingham Trent University, wrote in The Telegraph: ""It is another triumph of populism over science, of a capitulation to the demand to 'do something'. ""We are still seeing some notion that 'the people' are selfish and must be bullied and disciplined. ""The people are not selfish; they have behaved in ways that are individually rational but have collectively irrational results.""However Dr Andrea Collins, Senior Clinical Lecturer in Respiratory Medicine at the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine (LSTM), said: ""I believe that they have not quite gone far enough. The 'absolutely' necessary to go to work is still being used by some when it is not required-I think we need permits across controlled areas to go to a workplace.""Recent modelling from the universities of Exeter, Bristol and Warwick suggested that without any measures at all, the epidemic would have peaked around 133 days after first person-to-person transmission in Britain, which happened around February 28. So the lockdown has the potential of curtailing the spread by around seven weeks. A welcome relief for people who could have been facing lockdown for most of the summer.",Newspaper; Web Publication
283,Inside the government's behavioural 'nudge unit',"April 3, 2020 Friday",International,The Independent (United Kingdom),916,916,England & Wales,KIM SENGUPTA DEFENCE EDITOR,Inside the government's behavioural 'nudge unit',"A senior figure from the world of intelligence and defence, who specialised in China and cyber warfare, has been appointed to one of the top posts in the government's ""nudge unit"", which is involved in the campaign against the coronavirus outbreak.Rachel Coyle, who has received an MBE for services to defence, is the new managing director of the Behavioural Insights Team (BIT) helping to develop strategy for the pandemic at the Cabinet Office.The work of the ""nudge unit"" was relatively little known until its role became more widely publicised over Covid-19, especially over the concept of ""herd immunity"" to combat the virus and the effect this had on the timing of the eventual lockdown ordered by Boris Johnson.Ms Coyle, who has a masters in Chinese studies from Cambridge, spent six years at the Ministry of Defence, where she started as analyst with Mandarin language skills before being promoted to policy advisor at the Permanent Joint Headquarters, then private secretary to the deputy chief of defence staff (military strategy & operations) General Sir Richard Barrons, and finally assistant head of cyber operations policy.After receiving her MBE in 2013, Ms Coyle joined Salamanca, a business intelligence and investigations group, where she became head of corporate intelligence in charge of the company's international offices.Starting her job with the ""nudge unit"" at the end of last month, Ms Coyle stated in a social media post: ""I'm really proud to have started a new role as managing director for the Behavioural Insights Team.""General Barrons, who went on to become chief of joint forces command, said: ""Rachel was one of the sharpest civil servants I have ever come across. I found her very impressive and she will no doubt do a very good job at a very difficult time.""As deputy chief of defence staff, General Barrons was in charge of the military support for national resilience and security in natural or man-made disasters as well as conflicts.He told The Independent: ""The potential risk of global pandemic has been with us for a very long time. Questions have to be asked of the government, industry and civil society on the level of preparedness when this pandemic occurred.""We can't have been completely surprised. In the future we obviously need to be better prepared. But we must not make the mistake of thinking that it's all just about pandemics. There will be a whole range of challenges ranging from climate change, the rise of China and the role of Russia. There needs to be a focus on strategy.""The strategy of ""nudging"" is based on the premise of changing behaviour through coaxing and pointing out positive outcomes to actions rather than through coercion. It was set up 10 years ago by the Cameron government and ownership is shared between its staff, the Cabinet Office and the charity Nesta which deals with innovations.David Halpern, BIT's chief executive, and a member of the Government's Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (SAGE) outlined to the BBC on 11 March the approach of shielding vulnerable people until enough of the country's population had been infected with Covid-19, and immunity would be acquired to halt its spread.""There's going to be a point, assuming the epidemic flows and grows as it will do, where you want to cocoon, to protect those at-risk groups so they don't catch the disease. By the time they come out of their cocooning, herd immunity has been achieved in the rest of the population,"" he said.On the same day Dominic Cummings, the chief advisor to Boris Johnson, is reported to have brought up the issue of herd immunity in a discussion with tech industry leaders. Two days later the government's chief scientific adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance, told BBC Radio 4 that one of the key things we need to do is to ""build up some kind of herd immunity so more people are immune to this disease and we reduce the transmission"".Matt Hancock, the health secretary, insisted a few days later that achieving herd immunity was not a stated policy. Instead, he said, ""in the coming weeks"" people over the age of 70 will be told to self-isolate.Richard Horton, editor-in-chief of the medical journal Lancet told the Commons Science and Technology Select Committee at the end of last month that SAGE, despite being chaired by the chief medical officer, Chris Whitty, and the chief scientific officer, Sir Patrick Vallance, had little input from public health doctors and medical officers. The dominant voices advising the government, he said, were mathematical modellers and behavioural scientists, including Dr Halpern.""There is evidence on modelling and on behavioural science, but I don't see the evidence from the public health community or from the clinical community,"" he said.""We thought we could have a controlled epidemic. We thought we could manage that epidemic over the course of March and April, push the curve to the right, build up herd immunity and that way we could protect people. The reason why that strategy was wrong is it didn't recognise that 20 per cent of people infected would end up with severe critical illness. The evidence was there at the end of January.""A senior Whitehall official involved with Covid-19 planning held, however, that Dr Halpern was explaining the theory of ""herd immunity"", not advocating it. He said ""a lot will come out in the future about what happened, not just the role of advisers, but politicians as well, I have no doubt that a lot of it very interesting for the public"".",Newspaper

An economist, behavioural scientist and epidemiologist have their sayWe asked three experts for their view on the question everyone's asking","                     Behavioural scientist                                        Prof. Pete Lunn, Head of Behavioural Research Unit, ESRI Department of Economics, Trinity College Dublin                   From the perspective of human behaviour, our situation is unprecedented in modern times. To understand what might happen next, as a behavioural scientist, I recommend first pausing to consider how we got here. A month ago, I regarded the phrase ""global community"" as fanciful, perhaps even oxymoronic. Yet the response to the coronavirus pandemic may be the most extensive global collective action undertaken by human beings in our history. In entering global lockdown, billions of people have sacrificed liberty, company and participation in wider society, all for the greater good. While extraordinary to behold, this behaviour is not entirely surprising. In times of crisis, this is what humans do. They pull together and strive for common goals, albeit with a bit of fraying at the edges.For decades, behavioural scientists have studied how individuals make sacrifices for common goals. Two crucial success factors are the desirability of the goal and whether everyone can see clearly how their behaviour leads to it. Thus far, the first factor has been straightforward. Random and potentially lethal infection is frightening and reducing it highly desirable. The second factor, meanwhile, has been ensured by a massive global public health campaign. So what do these two insights tell us about what happens next?While sensitivity to fear may decline somewhat, it will remain pretty strong. It is the second factor, the clear link from behaviour to collective goal, that is troublesome. For at some point, the epidemiologists will advise that restrictions can be partially lifted. Some workplaces will re-open, some gatherings will be allowed. It may be a crucial moment. As the crisis deepened, the logic that tighter restrictions on social activity would slow infection was easy to follow and daily increases in infections and deaths provided clear feedback. But can we reach similar collective understanding of how it is fine to relax some restrictions yet vital to keep others? Once infection is declining, what is the common goal?Epidemiologists, behavioural scientists and politicians will need to work together to articulate why some behaviours are fine but others not, and how this is best for all. Feedback on progress towards a collective goal is vital. One possibility is to relax restrictions in small steps, making each conditional on infections continuing to fall.Extraordinary global solidarity has characterised our initial response to this crisis. Getting out of it will require more subtle, but equally strong, collective action.                      Epidemiologist                                        Eric Brunner, professor of social and biological epidemiology, at UCL                   Lockdown exit ('Lexit') will not be a single event. Our collective yearning for an end-date will only grow, but as the terrible Covid-19 misery grinds on we must, as Goya warned, not let reason sleep. We will learn by observing epidemic trajectories in other countries as their policies change, but we will need to monitor carefully what happens in the UK before and after cautious relaxation of social distancing rules, when the decision is made.Testing will inform our responses. We must be prepared for anything, from a waning epidemic to a return           to full lockdown. Meaningful Lexit must wait for a vaccine, and everyone must have it, unless clearly contraindicated.            Vaccine hesitancy is a luxury we can no longer afford.Between now and then, testing for active disease and antibody-based immunity is clearly a priority. A fundamental principle in epidemiology, the scientific foundation of public health policy, is accurate measurement of health status. Without measuring the rate of Covid-19 infection, reliably, in the population, over the coming weeks and months, evidence-based policy development will be impossible. The epidemic has been poorly monitored up to now and this scandal must stop. We need a programme of rolling, representative surveys to capture the pattern of spread of Covid-19 in the UK, and how it changes. Age, sex, socioeconomic position, ethnicity and national region are vitally important variables. They are all underlying determinants of severe disease and death, and the evolution of the epidemic.The proportion of asymptomatic Sars-CoV-2-the virus that causes Covid-19-carriers in the population and the duration of immunity after infection are two major known unknowns at present. Both are critical for prospects of Lexit. Social solidarity, thankfully, is being expressed in myriad ways during the lockdown. Participating in Covid-19 surveys and research is a vital contribution to the social good.                     Economist                                        Julian Jessop, economist                   It is right to balance the benefits of saving lives which might be lost to Covid-19 against the costs of shutting down large parts of the economy. But this trade-off is still firmly in favour of maintaining the emergency measures for as long as the health experts think is necessary to get on top of the virus. Even a very large fall in GDP, lasting many months, would be a fair price to pay.There are also three reasons for optimism. First, this approach is supported by the lessons from history. For example, studies of how different US cities responded to the 'Spanish Flu' pandemic in 1918 found that those who intervened earlier and more aggressively recovered more quickly.Second, there are encouraging precedents elsewhere today. China has started to lift some of its restrictions and the economy there is now gradually returning to normal, albeit slowly. Admittedly, much of China's data is suspect. But similar improvements are being seen in other Asian economies which are also further down the road than the UK, notably South Korea and Taiwan (thanks to relatively effective testing and contact tracing).The third factor is the basic economics. Activity has fallen sharply because the UK government itself has slammed on the brakes. The exit strategy is therefore simple: gradually remove the restrictions as evidence grows that each has achieved its objectives.In the meantime, economic policy is doing the right things: protect businesses, jobs and incomes, so that the economy can quickly reboot. But the government should not hesitate to spend more if needed. With interest rates so low, and lower than future inflation, the real cost of borrowing is actually negative. The burden of debt will therefore be shared with the holders of UK government bonds, who don't seem to mind at all.",Newspaper; Web Publication

The thought that we might be responsible for specific bad outcomes can alter our behaviour more than learning the relevant information and facts.""In the experiment by the state think tank, a nationally representative sample of people were shown different posters with Covid-19 advice.One warned of the possibility of infecting a vulnerable person, such as someone's granny or a healthcare worker, and used images of real people to convey this message. Another poster warned that one person could infect many others, again using images of real people.A control group was shown posters communicating the government's advice in a more neutral way, with stick figures instead of real people.The people involved in the study were then asked about their plans for the next few days and which behaviours were acceptable or unacceptable. People who had viewed the more emotional posters were more cautious in their plans, while those who had been exposed to the information alone were less cautious about social distancing.""The findings suggest that the thought of infecting vulnerable people or large numbers of people can motivate social distancing. This has implications for communications strategies,"" the study reported.It added: ""We conclude that the study generates supportive evidence for communications that not only inform people about recommended behaviour, but that emphasise the impact of non-compliance on identifiable people and the potential number of infections.""The researchers noted that the study had limitations, but was designed to be carried out rapidly to test the hypothesis that emotional messaging is beneficial when dealing with a pandemic such as Covid-19.""Much more research is needed,"" they said. ""Communication strategies will benefit from not only rapid experiments but also rapid replication of experiments. However, despite the rapidly evolving nature of the Covid-19 pandemic, it is possible to use the techniques of behavioural science to support policy, including via the pre-testing of interventions.""The research was carried out online on a group of 500 adults who were paid (EURO)5 each.

Do we never learn? It was mathematical modelling that developed ""products"" that led to the banking crisis of 2008.Despite the years of austerity there are resources in local government that we have also failed to use. There have been environmental health officers (EHOs) up and down the country desperate to help their public health colleagues - for example, with tracing contacts after testing (if there had been any). They would also have been more effective at getting messages out to the public, particularly those most vulnerable or living in multi-occupied houses. Many EHOs have been left twiddling their thumbs for too long when their whole reason to exist is to protect public health.Their professional body has at least stepped up, not least to provide a guide to safe shopping during the Covid-19 pandemic. That is a sad reflection on our lack of preparedness, despite the warnings. Dr Stephen BattersbyVice-president, Chartered Institute of Environmental Health It is a common view that the British government moved too late to institute a policy of testing everyone who has had recent contact with known coronavirus cases. However, there are several English local authorities in which there are fewer than five known cases and case density in the local population is very low.Using the most recent current figures, these include Hull, Blackburn, and Darlington. Testing all those who have had contact with the known cases in these areas should be a strictly limited task. Once done, subject to movement restrictions in and out, productive activity in these areas can commence or recommence, engineering facilities put to use in producing items in critically short supply - and they can once again, after many years, become an engine of growth. Prof Michael WatersonDepartment ofeconomics, University of Warwick Re your article ( Just 2,000 key NHS staff have been tested, UK government admits, 1 April), there are no more tests. There are no more ventilators. There's no more PPE. At some point these statements will - and should - become the equivalent of the infamous ""There's no money left"" note left by Liam Byrne at the Treasury in 2010 - a note which condemned Labour to the role of financially reckless fall guys of the austerity narrative.But there's one key difference here: there always was money left, as evidenced by the government turning on the spending taps so freely to alleviate the impact of this current crisis. In contrast, medical equipment is finite. So, to be ill-prepared for a pandemic, even though you've gamed for such a scenario well in advance - whether that's down to precious time wasted tinkering with a now discredited scientific nudge theory or an unwillingness to spend money in advance born of ideological intransigence - is nothing short of criminal negligence. To hold those same people to account for these failures is not inappropriate politics; it's what any responsible and accountable democracy should do. Colin MontgomeryEdinburgh Matt Hancock says the UK will do 100,000 coronavirus tests per day by the end of April ( No 10 seeks to end coronavirus lockdown with 'immunity passports', 2 April). In other words, Boris Johnson's government is promising to deliver a specific result on a fixed date by relying on technology that doesn't exist yet. Stop me if you've heard this one before.

287,DIY SOS How to make your own coronavirus face mask while in lockdown,"April 3, 2020 Friday",International,thesun.co.uk,2141,2141,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,Gemma Mullin,DIY SOS How to make your own coronavirus face mask while in lockdown,"MEDICAL EXPERTS are pushing people to wear face masks, especially if you are showing symptoms and are outdoors in a bid to limit the spread of coronavirusBut with stocks dwindling and crucially needed by health workers helping those suffering from the killer bug, it has been difficult for the general public to get their own - so how about making one yourself?                                             Read our coronavirus live blog for the latest news & updates                   One area where there is no argument is that masks are vital for frontline health workers caring for Covid-19 patients - as they are at a much greater risk of catching it.But there are now growing calls for the Government to recommend widespread public use of masks.Experts from the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) met yesterday to consider key evidence.Ministers are expected to study the findings over the next few days before making the decision public and changing official guidance.But it's thought that they will advise Brits to wear face coverings in confined spaces such as on public transport, shops and in workplaces.The decision will likely be discussed at Cabinet on Thursday - and there could be another COBRA meeting to discuss it too.On the one hand, some scientists argue masks can prevent a person from spreading the virus, but don't stop you catching it.Meanwhile, others fear masks will make people complacent, giving them a false sense of security and risk further spread as people forget social distancing and handwashing measures.But some experts have said by branding them as ""face coverings"" it could clearly distinguish between surgical masks and items such as scarves or bandanas.However, hospital bosses have warned that encouraging the public to wear masks could jeopardise the NHS's vital supply chain.Amid fears over a lack of supply of PPE, what is the value of a homemade mask, or sourcing your own?                     Who should wear a mask?                   The World Health Organization (WHO) has repeatedly said that only those with Covid-19 symptoms and those caring for them need masks, but this guidance is set to be reviewed.Dr David Nabarro, special envoy for Covid-19 at the WHO, suggested during an interview last week that ""some form of facial protection is going to become the norm"".Last week, London Mayor Sadiq Khan also called for people to wear face masks outside - including on public transport.                     Do masks work?                   Experts are still pretty divided on their effectiveness outside of a medical setting.Wearing a mask can act as a physical barrier to prevent infecting others if you are sick by blocking the droplets that come out when you cough or sneeze.But some experts argue that people can accidentally infect themselves when taking a mask off or they can lead to complacency with other measures such as hand-washing.New evidence from Hong Kong about face masks has been shared confidentially with the World Health Organization.The data hasn't been made public yet but it reportedly suggests that the protective gear was effective in slowing the spread in Asian countries.                     Join our George Cross campaign for NHS staff                   We are urging Sun readers to sign a petition calling for our NHS staff to be awarded the George Cross.We are backing a proposal by Lord Ashcroft to honour our health heroes with the gallantry gong given for acts of bravery that did not take place in battle.A No10 spokesman said: ""The NHS is doing a fantastic job and the nation will want to find a way to say thank you when we have defeated this virus.""SAS hero Andy McNab added: ""The award of a George Cross would show an emotional appreciation.""We are asking our readers to please sign the petition below.Professor Susan Michie, of University College London, said there is ""not good evidence"" to suggest wearing masks will cut transmissions.She said: ""They do not protect against the virus getting into the eyes - only close fitting goggles do this.""People may not fit the masks properly or take them on and off. Touching face masks and not taking them off in the correct way may mean people contaminate their hands and spread the virus.""People may have a false sense of reassurance and thus pay less attention to other behaviours key to reducing transmission such as social distancing and hand-washing.""Paul Hunter, a professor in medicine at the University of East Anglia, reviewed 31 studies which looked at the efficacy of face masks in preventing respiratory illness.He said the research was poor, adding that it was ""as easy to make an argument for opposing the widespread use of masks as it would be to make an argument promoting their use"".Most experts are in agreement that for masks to work as they are intended, they must be used correctly.Dr Jenna Macciochi, a lecturer in immunology at the University of Sussex, told the Mail: ""To be effective, a mask has to be fitted correctly, worn correctly and disposed of correctly - which is not something the general public has been trained in.""She added that not wearing one correctly is potentially more hazardous than not using one at all, as you may infect yourself with the particles the mask is protecting you against when you take it off.The WHO says surgical masks can only help when used with other preventative measures such as frequent hand-washing.                     What are the different types of face mask and how well do they work?                   From dust masks to homemade coverings with cloth, there are a variety of protection methods popping up as people look for ways to prevent the spread of coronavirus.Here we take a look at some of the different types of face mask and how well they work...N95 respiratorsN95 masks are disposable face masks that are proven to filter the air to an industrial standard.Manufacturers vary, but the N95 is a stamp from the US National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health to show that it is efficient.The 'N' stands for 'Not resistant to oil,' because the mask only protects against particles, not fluids while the '95' means it filters out 95 per cent of airborne particles.They generally have an 8-hour shelf life before becoming clogged depending on the work you're doing.As they offer so much protection, they are used by doctors and nurses in a medical setting.However, they have not been recommended for use to the general public yet due to supply issues for health workers.                     Surgical masks                   These disposable 3-ply masks are fluid-resistant and they're the most common type of facial protection you'll see health care staff wearing.They are used to prevent infected droplets from doctors, nurses and carers entering the respiratory system of the patient.Although they don't have built-in air filters, they are considered effective enough for most staff outside of intensive care.The nose clip can be bent to fit snugly around the nose however they are a loose fit and the material gapes at the sides so they don't protect against all particles.When they become wet, they're effectiveness is also reduced.Also, they are disposable and are only intended to be worn once.                     DIY dust masks (FFP)                   Found in most hardware stores, dust masks can offer some level of protection from particles - if worn correctly.If it says FFP1 then it's a basic kind of dust mask and offers the lowest level of filtration for this kind of respirators mask.To meet European standards, they have to be able to filter at least 80 per cent of particles - with FFP 3 filtering 99 per cent.That means that it can't filter out tiny particles associated with viruses and bacteria.You can also get a FFP3 mask, which looks similar but has a small filter in the middle to catch almost all airborne particles.Short of being a full gas mask it offers the best protection - as long as it fits properly - and is more effective than an N95 as well as the FFP1 and FFP2.                     Cycling masks                   These are generally worn by cyclists to prevent them from breathing in pollution in heavy traffic.Usually made from neoprene, they fit tightly to the face and are intended to offer a level of protection from airborne particles.Some are also marketed as N95, or N99 grade, which means the amount of filtered airbone particles is either 95 or 99 per cent.                     Homemade masks                   As many people can't get their hands on a mask, some have turned to fashioning their own.There's been tips on using vacuum cleaner bags and even sanitary towels to cover your face.While most won't be as effective as anything you can buy in a store, they will offer more protection than not covering your face at all.Research by Public Health England in 2013 looked at the suitability of houeshold materials that could be used as maks to filter bacterial and viral aerosols and found vacuum bags actually worked well.Experts say that you should aim for multiple layers - a double layer of tightly-woven cotton with a thread count of at least 180 was one of the best barriers, according to researchers in the US.Even a bandana, scarf or T-shirt can be used to cover your nose and mouth while in public.                     What is the guidance on masks in the UK?                   The British public hasn't been advised to wear face masks to protect against coronavirus - unless you're caring for someone with the disease or you work on the frontline.Health Secretary Matt Hancock told            Good Morning Britain: ""           Masks are very important to protect healthcare workers...""But (asking the public to wear them) isn't something that we've done here because we've followed the advice.""And we've followed the medical and scientific advice and the whole basis of our response has been making sure that we follow the science.""However scientific advisers for the Government are carrying out a review of the use of face masks.Chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance has also signalled that No10 could change its mind on the use of masks.                     How to make a homemade mask                   Homemade masks won't offer the same level of protection as medical-grade ones, but it hasn't stopped DIY tutorials popping up online.One of the simplest ones involves using two layers of kitchen roll and one tissue cut in half.You then cover each end with masking tape - and you can even tape down some wire to stiffen the mask, if you have any.Finish by punching holes in each end and threading elastic through to fit around your ears.If you don't have elastic bands you could also use a hair tie.

T-shirt technique                   Another method involves using a T-shirt without the need for any sewing or stitching.A YouTube tutorial by Runa Ray explains that for the T-shirt method, you need to cut out a 16in by 4in rectangle from the material.Then fold it in half and measure 4in on either side before making an equal number of cuts along the edges with scissors.Then turn the fabric inside out and knot each of the tails, but leave the four outer edges.Cut two more strips of material and tie them to the ends - these are the straps that will go around your ears.Some people have also used a vacuum cleaner bag to create a face mask, which is a bit more complicated - and only works if you have a spare, clean bag to hand.                     Are other countries ordering citizens to wear masks?                   Officials in New York City are urging people to wear masks when they go outside.Mayor Bill de Blasio said coverings for the nose and mouth can be ""real homegrown"" and made from a scarf or bandana.It is believed new US Government guidance would suggest non-medical masks, T-shirts or bandanas be used to cover the nose and mouth when outside the home, while professional-grade masks are kept for healthcare workers.In Europe, Austria, Slovakia, the Czech Republic and Bosnia-Herzegovina have introduced these measures.Residents in the Philippines have to wear a mask in public, and the same is true in some of the worst-affected provinces in China.In Japan, where masks were already a household staple, the government plans to post two gauze masks to each of the country's 50 million households.People in Hong Kong, South Korea, Thailand and Taiwan regularly wear masks because of air pollution.",Newspaper; Web Publication
288,"How long will the UK coronavirus lockdown last?;Less than 12 hours after the Prime Minister's historic address to the nation, the London Underground was still jammed with commuters","April 3, 2020 Friday",International,telegraph.co.uk,1234,1234,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,"By Sarah Knapton, Science Editor","How long will the UK coronavirus lockdown last?Less than 12 hours after the Prime Minister's historic address to the nation, the London Underground was still jammed with commuters","Boris Johnson took the unprecedented step of curtailing individual freedoms to prevent the further spread of            coronavirus.The Prime Minister said that measures would be in place for three weeks-until April 13-and then reviewed. But given the expected trajectory of the disease, and the decisions taken by other countries who are ahead of Britain in terms of virus progression, it is unlikely the restrictions will be lifted then.•What the UK lockdown means for youFor a start, compared to most countries, the UK had a porous and half-hearted beginning to its isolation measures, with seemingly few people choosing to stay inside. Less than 12 hours after the Prime Minister's historic address to the nation on March 23, the London Underground was jammed with commuters (see video below), while builders were seen eating together in communal canteens, making a mockery of the Government's rule that no more than two people can gather together in public.Professor Susan Michie, Director of the University College London's Centre for Behaviour Change, warned that some people would simply not be able to carry out the measures, even if they wanted to.""Five million self-employed people are being left potentially destitute by the Government failing to offer financial supportas they have done for directly employed workers,"" she said. ""Since [statutory sick pay of] £94 is not enough to pay rent, bills, food for a family etc, they will be forced to carry on as usual.""The British Transport Police is now on hand to make sure only            critical workers are using the London Underground. But such an inauspicious start to the lockdown suggests the virus will spread further than it would have, had stricter measures been implemented earlier,            as they have in other countries. And it means that the measures we do have are likely to be in place for longer to ""flatten the curve"" in a way that would prevent a second dangerous peak.In addition, on April 1 the Government revealed figures that suggested the lockdown was starting to fray as data showed an ""uptick""            in the number of people using transport.The number of those using their cars and public transport, which had been consistently dropping since strict social distancing measures were introduced, rose for the first time.It is feared that sunny weather will prompt more people to break the rules and go outside and socialise as the Easter holidays begin.Mervyn King, the former Governor of the Bank of England, warned that there could be a ""rebellion"" if the measures are enforced for too long. Meanwhile, China has announced it will           finally be ending lockdown in Wuhanon April 8, a huge milestone for the country and a signal that the crisis-for them at least-is nearing its end. The city in Hubei province was the epicentre of the coronavirus outbreak.Yet it took more than two months of extremely draconian restrictions, including travel bans and quarantine zones, to achieve the level of containment seen in Wuhan. Britain is nowhere near that level of lockdown.And the Chinese restrictions were not lifted for more than 12 weeks after the first death, so if Britain follows a similar path, ours may need to be in place until the end of May/early June. Certainly, that is when the Government has said it expects cases to peak and then level out.However, from papers released recently, we know the Government is at least considering restricting movement for the rest of the year.The Scientific Pandemic Influenza Group on Modelling, which feeds into the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), proposed that because of the length of the outbreak, parts of the country could be placed in six-month lockdowns at a time, before being allowed more freedom. Professor Rowland Kao, the Sir Timothy O'Shea Professor of Veterinary Epidemiology and Data Science at the University of Edinburgh, said: ""It must be hoped that such measures will only last a relatively short time.""However, we must be prepared for this not to be the case, and for them to be in place for an extended period.""The next weeks until the Prime Minister's review will be crucial, as the unfolding epidemic will now be seen in real time, rather than through modelling, allowing experts to make more accurate predictions of when it will peak, and finally die away. It is also possible that after three weeks it becomes apparent that the costs to shutting down society far outweigh the benefit of slowing the spread and the government may choose to lift restrictions even before the peak.•Listen to the daily podcastProfessor Mark Woolhouse, Professor of Infectious Disease Epidemiology, University of Edinburgh, said: ""We now enter a phase of careful monitoring. We are looking for indicators first that the epidemic is slowing down and then for numbers of new cases to start to fall. ""After three weeks we will have to decide whether the restrictions need to be continued, can be relaxed, or can be relaxed temporarily with the expectation of imposing them again later. ""We must also monitor the damage that the lockdown is doing; damage to the economy, to education, to psychological well-being and to health and social care provision in the community. The impacts of this epidemic are too far reaching for policy decisions to be driven by epidemiology alone.""Professor Sheila Bird said that more cases in coming weeks would make it easier for the Government to predict how the epidemic is responding to lockdown measures, which will inform how long they remain in place. ""Once an epidemic takes hold, as now in UK, the country's own data - properly reported and interpreted - take precedence over modelling as the data tell us the actual toll which the epidemic is exacting,"" she said.""A huge amount can be inferred about the immediately forthcoming weeks from these data directly, including whether further policy changes are needed to reinforce social-distancing; for example in particular age groups.""Some experts are still concerned that the current restrictions do not go far enough while others say the government has been hit by an ""epidemic of action"", and is now bringing in measures that have little rationale. Professor Robert Dingwall, Professor of Sociology, at Nottingham Trent University, wrote in The Telegraph: ""It is another triumph of populism over science, of a capitulation to the demand to 'do something'. ""We are still seeing some notion that 'the people' are selfish and must be bullied and disciplined. ""The people are not selfish; they have behaved in ways that are individually rational but have collectively irrational results.""However Dr Andrea Collins, Senior Clinical Lecturer in Respiratory Medicine at the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine (LSTM), said: ""I believe that they have not quite gone far enough. The 'absolutely' necessary to go to work is still being used by some when it is not required-I think we need permits across controlled areas to go to a workplace.""Recent modelling from the universities of Exeter, Bristol and Warwick suggested that without any measures at all, the epidemic would have peaked around 133 days after first person-to-person transmission in Britain, which happened around February 28. So the lockdown has the potential of curtailing the spread by around seven weeks. A welcome relief for people who could have been facing lockdown for most of the summer.",Newspaper; Web Publication
289,The chaotic government response to coronavirus is closer to the failures of 1914 than the determination of 1940;NHS workers are like the badly-led British troops in the First World War: 'Lions led by donkeys',"April 3, 2020 Friday",International,The Independent (United Kingdom),1202,1202,England & Wales,Patrick Cockburn,The chaotic government response to coronavirus is closer to the failures of 1914 than the determination of 1940NHS workers are like the badly-led British troops in the First World War: 'Lions led by donkeys',"Government leaders everywhere are calling for their people to wage war against the coronavirus outbreak, recalling past victories in an effort to boost public morale. In Britain, politicians cite the            Second World War as a suitable example of determined and successful resistance to a terrifying enemy.Yet the faltering response of the British authorities to the Covid-19 pandemic so far is much closer to the failures of 1914 than anything that happened in 1940. The parallels are striking between the crisis today and the one that exploded on the world just over a hundred years ago. Then as now there was poor leadership - inadequately prepared and hampered by an initially mistaken strategy - sending frontline forces over the top to suffer massive losses. The difference is that then the casualties were in the British army and today they are in the            NHS. ""Lions led by donkeys,"" was the phrase used to condemn the waste of lives by incompetent First World War generals and their political masters. The same words could be used again today: once the shortages were of machine guns and artillery shells while now they are of ventilators, surgical masks and testing kits. The common feature is that in both cases the shortage will kill or disable a proportion of those who do not receive essential equipment.The analogy could go on: the best trained troops of the British Expeditionary Force were all but wiped out in the first months of fighting and were replaced by enthusiastic but ill-trained volunteers. How will all those volunteering for service in Covid-19 hospitals fare when they begin to fill up?Overdramatic? A pandemic is not the same as war? Governments around the world are already talking of potentially millions of dead unless the virus is brought under control. It is disrupting life and destroying economies on a scale not seen since 1945.An excuse for the stumbling performance of most governments is that this crisis is unprecedented. Although China, Taiwan, South Korea and Singapore put their experience with the Sars epidemic to good use. Again the best comparison is with 1914 which was the first great international military conflict since the Napoleonic Wars a hundred years earlier. Come the Second World War people had plenty of grim experience of what such an earth-shaking conflict would be like. But this does not quite explain why British political and scientific leadership has been visibly worse than almost all other developed countries. From the beginning, the authorities underestimated the gravity of the crisis: only five-and-a-half weeks ago, on 21 February, a meeting of government scientific advisers concluded that Covid-19 posed only a ""moderate risk"" to Britain. This was well after the epidemic had swept through China, where there were already 75,465 cases and 2,236 deaths, and was spreading to South Korea, Taiwan, Iran, Italy and France.Scientific panjandrums who have since become television celebrities, such as the pandemic modeller Neil Ferguson, were at the meeting. But there appeared little objections raised to the conclusion directly afterwards. A quarter of a million people were allowed to attend the Cheltenham Festival on 10 to 13 March, only ten days before Boris Johnson said that everybody should stay at home and not gather in large numbers to avoid the spread of the deadly virus. These were miscalculations of First World War dimensions and are already exacting a heavy toll in human lives.The government appears to think in slogans and not in joined up policies. ""Get Brexit Done"" has been replaced by ""Stay home, protect the NHS, save lives"". There is an amateur air about all that is done: giant drive-through testing facilities were opened at Chessington World of Adventures and Ikea at Wembley, but nobody from the NHS was let in without a email giving them an appointment, something almost impossible to obtain.A counterpart to the British tradition of amateurism is an exaggerated respect for supposed experts. In times of trouble, everybody looks for saviours with magical powers: a hundred years ago this was to be Kitchener and today we hope that the chief scientific officer, Sir Patrick Vallance, and the chief medical officer, Chris Whitty, both articulate confident professionals, know a feasible way out of the crisis. Yet it was Whitty and Vallance who presided over the initial disastrous flirtation with ""herd immunity"" - let most people get the illness aside from the most vulnerable - that was only abandoned on 16 March. Since then ministers have tried to distance themselves from a strategy that is condemned by almost everybody, even President Trump, who, with shameless hypocrisy, has described it as ""catastrophic"".Critics unkindly point out that this political distancing will not work since Dr David Halpern, a senior Downing Street official, gave an interview five days before the government's U-turn, confirming that official policy was to protect the most vulnerable so by the time they emerged from their cocooning, ""herd immunity has been achieved in the rest of the population.""The government is racking up an impressive record of poor judgement and inability to translate words into action. Why did it adopt a policy so different from the rest of Europe and Asia and contrary to that advised by the World Health Organisation (WHO). One explanation is probably that a Brexiteer cabinet, whose members had spent three years lauding the virtues of British separatism and exceptionalism, found nothing strange about going their own way. Another is that the British have always had difficulty in taking on board that they can learn anything from the experience of other nations and must wait until it happens to them.                     There are other dangers on the horizon that might be averted if the experience of past world crises is taken into account. It is important not to overreact to chaos by putting some outside figure as head of medical procurement like Churchill's appointment of his friend and ally Lord Beaverbrook, the owner of The Daily Express, as minister of aircraft production in 1940, in the mistaken belief that he would ""energise"" the aircraft industry.But according to General Sir Alan Brooke, the supremely competent British chief of staff, he disrupted the carefully planned output of different types of aircraft. Brooke was particularly enraged when Beaverbrook used armour needed for tanks to make his own entirely useless armoured car, called the Beaverette, to be supplied to the Home Guard. His other stunt was to organise a campaign whereby kitchen utensils - along with ornamental railings - were collected as scrap that were supposed to be melted down to be turned into aircraft: ""we will turn your pots and pans into Spitfires and Hurricanes, Blenheims and Wellingtons."" By most accounts, municipal dumps were full of useless and unused scrap by the end of the war.The First World War exposed most governments in Europe and beyond as bunglers who could not cope with a real crisis. The pandemic is likely to provoke a similar political earthquake that governments, which carelessly use the rhetoric of war to their own advantage, will be lucky to survive.",Newspaper; Web Publication

294,"How long will the UK coronavirus lockdown last?;Less than 12 hours after the Prime Minister's historic address to the nation, the London Underground was still jammed with commuters","April 4, 2020 Saturday",International,telegraph.co.uk,1234,1234,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,"By Sarah Knapton, Science Editor","How long will the UK coronavirus lockdown last?Less than 12 hours after the Prime Minister's historic address to the nation, the London Underground was still jammed with commuters","Boris Johnson took the unprecedented step of curtailing individual freedoms to prevent the further spread of            coronavirus.The Prime Minister said that measures would be in place for three weeks-until April 13-and then reviewed. But given the expected trajectory of the disease, and the decisions taken by other countries who are ahead of Britain in terms of virus progression, it is unlikely the restrictions will be lifted then.•What the UK lockdown means for youFor a start, compared to most countries, the UK had a porous and half-hearted beginning to its isolation measures, with seemingly few people choosing to stay inside. Less than 12 hours after the Prime Minister's historic address to the nation on March 23, the London Underground was jammed with commuters (see video below), while builders were seen eating together in communal canteens, making a mockery of the Government's rule that no more than two people can gather together in public.Professor Susan Michie, Director of the University College London's Centre for Behaviour Change, warned that some people would simply not be able to carry out the measures, even if they wanted to.""Five million self-employed people are being left potentially destitute by the Government failing to offer financial supportas they have done for directly employed workers,"" she said. ""Since [statutory sick pay of] £94 is not enough to pay rent, bills, food for a family etc, they will be forced to carry on as usual.""The British Transport Police is now on hand to make sure only            critical workers are using the London Underground. But such an inauspicious start to the lockdown suggests the virus will spread further than it would have, had stricter measures been implemented earlier,            as they have in other countries. And it means that the measures we do have are likely to be in place for longer to ""flatten the curve"" in a way that would prevent a second dangerous peak.In addition, on April 1 the Government revealed figures that suggested the lockdown was starting to fray as data showed an ""uptick""            in the number of people using transport.The number of those using their cars and public transport, which had been consistently dropping since strict social distancing measures were introduced, rose for the first time.It is feared that sunny weather will prompt more people to break the rules and go outside and socialise as the Easter holidays begin.Mervyn King, the former Governor of the Bank of England, warned that there could be a ""rebellion"" if the measures are enforced for too long. Meanwhile, China has announced it will           finally be ending lockdown in Wuhanon April 8, a huge milestone for the country and a signal that the crisis-for them at least-is nearing its end. The city in Hubei province was the epicentre of the coronavirus outbreak.Yet it took more than two months of extremely draconian restrictions, including travel bans and quarantine zones, to achieve the level of containment seen in Wuhan. Britain is nowhere near that level of lockdown.And the Chinese restrictions were not lifted for more than 12 weeks after the first death, so if Britain follows a similar path, ours may need to be in place until the end of May/early June. Certainly, that is when the Government has said it expects cases to peak and then level out.However, from papers released recently, we know the Government is at least considering restricting movement for the rest of the year.The Scientific Pandemic Influenza Group on Modelling, which feeds into the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), proposed that because of the length of the outbreak, parts of the country could be placed in six-month lockdowns at a time, before being allowed more freedom. Professor Rowland Kao, the Sir Timothy O'Shea Professor of Veterinary Epidemiology and Data Science at the University of Edinburgh, said: ""It must be hoped that such measures will only last a relatively short time.""However, we must be prepared for this not to be the case, and for them to be in place for an extended period.""The next weeks until the Prime Minister's review will be crucial, as the unfolding epidemic will now be seen in real time, rather than through modelling, allowing experts to make more accurate predictions of when it will peak, and finally die away. It is also possible that after three weeks it becomes apparent that the costs to shutting down society far outweigh the benefit of slowing the spread and the government may choose to lift restrictions even before the peak.•Listen to the daily podcastProfessor Mark Woolhouse, Professor of Infectious Disease Epidemiology, University of Edinburgh, said: ""We now enter a phase of careful monitoring. We are looking for indicators first that the epidemic is slowing down and then for numbers of new cases to start to fall. ""After three weeks we will have to decide whether the restrictions need to be continued, can be relaxed, or can be relaxed temporarily with the expectation of imposing them again later. ""We must also monitor the damage that the lockdown is doing; damage to the economy, to education, to psychological well-being and to health and social care provision in the community. The impacts of this epidemic are too far reaching for policy decisions to be driven by epidemiology alone.""Professor Sheila Bird said that more cases in coming weeks would make it easier for the Government to predict how the epidemic is responding to lockdown measures, which will inform how long they remain in place. ""Once an epidemic takes hold, as now in UK, the country's own data - properly reported and interpreted - take precedence over modelling as the data tell us the actual toll which the epidemic is exacting,"" she said.""A huge amount can be inferred about the immediately forthcoming weeks from these data directly, including whether further policy changes are needed to reinforce social-distancing; for example in particular age groups.""Some experts are still concerned that the current restrictions do not go far enough while others say the government has been hit by an ""epidemic of action"", and is now bringing in measures that have little rationale. Professor Robert Dingwall, Professor of Sociology, at Nottingham Trent University, wrote in The Telegraph: ""It is another triumph of populism over science, of a capitulation to the demand to 'do something'. ""We are still seeing some notion that 'the people' are selfish and must be bullied and disciplined. ""The people are not selfish; they have behaved in ways that are individually rational but have collectively irrational results.""However Dr Andrea Collins, Senior Clinical Lecturer in Respiratory Medicine at the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine (LSTM), said: ""I believe that they have not quite gone far enough. The 'absolutely' necessary to go to work is still being used by some when it is not required-I think we need permits across controlled areas to go to a workplace.""Recent modelling from the universities of Exeter, Bristol and Warwick suggested that without any measures at all, the epidemic would have peaked around 133 days after first person-to-person transmission in Britain, which happened around February 28. So the lockdown has the potential of curtailing the spread by around seven weeks. A welcome relief for people who could have been facing lockdown for most of the summer.",Newspaper; Web Publication

Read our coronavirus live blog for the latest news & updates                   He said there was little evidence to show the masks help and would be better used by healthcare workers and patients who test positive.But it puts the UK at odds with the increasing number of countries starting to advise their citizens to wear some form of face covering when they head outdoors.The US has changed its stance and is preparing to formalise new guidance to recommend Americans cover their mouth with items such as bandanas, snoods, scarves, T-shirts or homemade cloth if they cannot access a mask.Officials in New York City are already urging people to wear masks when they go outside.Mayor Bill de Blasio said coverings for the nose and mouth can be ""real homegrown"" and made from a scarf or bandana.Los Angeles mayor Eric Garcetti has also encouraged his city's residents to cover their faces when out in public.

Touching face masks and not taking them off in the correct way may mean people contaminate their hands and spread the virus.""People may have a false sense of reassurance and thus pay less attention to other behaviours key to reducing transmission such as social distancing and hand-washing.""Last night deputy chief medical officer John Van-Tam explained there was no evidence that wearing a mask stops the spread of the virus.Speaking at the daily press conference in No10, he said: ""Yes it is true that we do see very large amounts of mask wearing particularly in Southeast Asia but we have always seen that for many decades and it is entirely wired into some cultures that masks are worn quite frequently in open spaces. So it's very different.""But in terms of the hard evidence and what the UK Government recommends, we do not recommend face masks for general wearing by the public.""

296,Virus response is 'lions led by donkeys' all over again,"April 4, 2020 Saturday",International,The Independent (United Kingdom),1194,1194,England & Wales,PATRICK COCKBURN,Virus response is 'lions led by donkeys' all over again,"Government leaders everywhere are calling for their people to wage war against the coronavirus outbreak, recalling past victories in an effort to boost public morale. In Britain, politicians cite the Second World War as a suitable example of determined and successful resistance to a terrifying enemy.Yet the faltering response of the British authorities to the Covid-19 pandemic so far is much closer to the failures of 1914 than anything that happened in 1940. The parallels are striking between the crisis today and the one that exploded on the world just over a hundred years ago. Then as now there was poor leadership - inadequately prepared and hampered by an initially mistaken strategy - sending frontline forces over the top to suffer massive losses. The difference is that then the casualties were in the British army and today they are in the NHS.""Lions led by donkeys,"" was the phrase used to condemn the waste of lives by incompetent First World War generals and their political masters. The same words could be used again today: once the shortages were of machine guns and artillery shells while now they are of ventilators, surgical masks and testing kits. The common feature is that in both cases the shortage will kill or disable a proportion of those who do not receive essential equipment.The analogy could go on: the best trained troops of the British Expeditionary Force were all but wiped out in the first months of fighting and were replaced by enthusiastic but ill-trained volunteers. How will all those volunteering for service in Covid-19 hospitals fare when they begin to fill up? Overdramatic? A pandemic is not the same as war? Governments around the world are already talking of potentially millions of dead unless the virus is brought under control. It is disrupting life and destroying economies on a scale not seen since 1945.An excuse for the stumbling performance of most governments is that this crisis is unprecedented.Although China, Taiwan, South Korea and Singapore put their experience with the Sars epidemic to good use. Again the best comparison is with 1914 which was the first great international military conflict since the Napoleonic Wars a hundred years earlier. Come the Second World War people had plenty of grim experience of what such an earth-shaking conflict would be like.But this does not quite explain why British political and scientific leadership has been visibly worse than almost all other developed countries. From the beginning, the authorities underestimated the gravity of the crisis: only five-and-a-half weeks ago, on 21 February, a meeting of government scientific advisers concluded that Covid-19 posed only a ""moderate risk"" to Britain. This was well after the epidemic had swept through China, where there were already 75,465 cases and 2,236 deaths, and was spreading to South Korea, Taiwan, Iran, Italy and France.Scientific panjandrums who have since become television celebrities, such as the pandemic modeller Neil Ferguson, were at the meeting. But there appeared little objections raised to the conclusion directly afterwards. A quarter of a million people were allowed to attend the Cheltenham Festival on 10 to 13 March, only ten days before Boris Johnson said that everybody should stay at home and not gather in large numbers to avoid the spread of the deadly virus. These were miscalculations of First World War dimensions and are already exacting a heavy toll in human lives.The government appears to think in slogans and not in joined up policies. ""Get Brexit Done""has been replaced by ""Stay home, protect the NHS, save lives"". There is an amateur air about all that is done: giant drive-through testing facilities were opened at Chessington World of Adventures and Ikea at Wembley, but nobody from the NHS was let in without a email giving them an appointment, something almost impossible to obtain.A counterpart to the British tradition of amateurism is an exaggerated respect for supposed experts. In times of trouble, everybody looks for saviours with magical powers: a hundred years ago this was to beKitchener and today we hope that the chief scientific officer, Sir Patrick Vallance, and the chief medical officer, Chris Whitty, both articulate confident professionals, know a feasible way out of the crisis. Yet it was Whitty and Vallance who presided over the initial disastrous flirtation with ""herd immunity"" - let most people get the illness aside from the most vulnerable -that was only abandoned on 16 March. Since then ministers have tried to distance themselves from a strategy that is condemned by almost everybody, even President Trump, who, with shameless hypocrisy, has described it as ""catastrophic"".Critics unkindly point out that this political distancing will not work since Dr David Halpern, a senior Downing Street official, gave an interview five days before the government's U-turn, confirming that official policy was to protect the most vulnerable so by the time they emerged from their cocooning, ""herd immunity has been achieved in the rest of the population.""The government is racking up an impressive record of poor judgement and inability to translate words into action. Why did it adopt a policy so different from the rest of Europe and Asia and contrary to that advised by the World Health Organisation (WHO). One explanation is probably that a Brexiteer cabinet, whose members had spent three years lauding the virtues of British separatism and exceptionalism, found nothing strange about going their own way. Another is that the British have always had difficulty in taking on board that they can learn anything from the experience of other nations and must wait until it happens to them.There are other dangers on the horizon that might be averted if the experience of past world crises is taken into account. It is important not to overreact to chaos by putting some outside figure as head of medical procurement likeChurchill's appointment of his friend and ally Lord Beaverbrook, the owner of The Daily Express, as minister ofaircraft production in 1940, in the mistaken belief that he would ""energise""the aircraft industry.But according to General Sir Alan Brooke, the supremely competent British chief of staff, he disrupted the carefully planned output of different types of aircraft. Brooke was particularly enraged when Beaverbrook used armour needed for tanks to make his own entirely useless armoured car, called the Beaverette, to be supplied to the Home Guard. His other stunt was to organise a campaign whereby kitchen utensils - along with ornamental railings - were collected as scrap that were supposed to be melted down to be turned into aircraft: ""we will turn your pots and pans into Spitfires and Hurricanes, Blenheims and Wellingtons."" By most accounts, municipal dumps were full of useless and unused scrap by the end of the war.The First World War exposed most governments in Europe and beyond as bunglers who could not cope with a real crisis. The pandemic is likely to provoke a similar political earthquake thatgovernments, which carelessly use the rhetoric of war to their own advantage, will be lucky to survive.",Newspaper
297,Our three-step plan for ending economy's virus hibernation,"April 5, 2020",International,The Sunday Telegraph (London),517,517,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,,Our three-step plan for ending economy's virus hibernation,"Commentary By Gerard Lyons and Paul Ormerod Alockdown is necessary to limit the spread of the virus and save lives, but it is not feasible or practical to prolong it for too long. A long lockdown will wipe out large swathes of the economy. There will be a negative impact both financially and mentally on too many people.It is important to make plans now for when and why the lockdown will end. There are significant trade-offs in these key decisions.In a new research paper, we have outlined how to end the lockdown in a phased and gradual way.The mathematical models of epidemiology currently occupy centre-stage in policymaking.To be absolutely clear, these models have real scientific value and have had a positive impact on policy making, justifying the lockdown.Using the analytical framework of epidemiological models and the key behavioural insights from economics it is possible to outline a credible exit strategy.If people revert very quickly to the patterns of behaviour of before the crisis, the epidemiological models are correct - there would be a second wave of infections.But behaviour will be different, either because of the lessons people have learned during this crisis, or because of the constraints placed upon them by rules and regulations. How many people will shake hands the day after the lockdown is lifted? Incentives matter. This is a key point that comes to the fore in economics.It may be overlooked if we rely purely on the arguments of epidemiologists to prolong the lockdown. We suggest that lockdown is followed by three phases, as with traffic lights, from red to amber to green. Then everyone is clear about the sense of direction and it also gives hope.The first phase would deliberately be called red, where we must still stop doing things we might have done before the crisis. More but not all types of shops could open and they would have to exercise strict social distancing, as most supermarkets do now. Travel should still be discouraged and many international flights banned.Then to amber, as conditions improve, but we still need to be careful. Unlimited private car journeys should be allowed but not to crowded places.There would have to be attempts to vary the rush-hour, with different opening and closing times. Wearing masks and disposable gloves could be compulsory when using public transport. Restaurants could reopen but uphold social distancing.Eventually, back to green, when medical experts can give the all-clear. It would only be in the green phase that any sporting events or mass gatherings could take place, or places of worship reopen. It is in large gatherings that a single person may infect many. Mass transit could return to normal.The lockdown is helping overcome the health risk the country faces.However, only by ending the lockdown can we bring the economy out of hibernation and back to life.Dr Gerard Lyons is chief economist at Netwealth and Paul Ormerod is a visiting professor of computer science at University College London.'Behaviour will be different. How many people will shake hands the day after the lockdown is lifted?'",Newspaper
298,WHEN WILL IT BE SAFE TO GO BACK TO NORMAL?,"April 5, 2020 Sunday",International,The Daily Mail and Mail on Sunday (London),2442,2442,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,BY JO MACFARLANE,WHEN WILL IT BE SAFE TO GO BACK TO NORMAL?,"IT is a crisis many have long feared, and even grimly predicted - but, perhaps, secretly hoped or never quite believed would happen. Not here. Not to us. And yet, here we are. The coronavirus pandemic is surging towards a peak in Britain. Deaths this weekend passed 700 a day- and life has come to a standstill, with our own, and the world's, biggest economies on a knife edge.In the midst of this, deputy chief medical officer Jenny Harries dispatched a chilling warning - that life may not return to normal for at least six months.For the moment, at least, there appears to be no exit strategy, no clear way out. There are no drugs proven to work; no vaccine for at least another 18 months which could protect us. World-leading experts advising the Government are clear: as soon as the lockdown is lifted, infection rates will - not could, will - begin to rise again. We must not suddenly revert to our normal way of living,' Dr Harries told the nation, in the starkest possible terms. That would be quite dangerous.'Dangerous means more lives lost. But the prospect of a lengthy lockdown, with no end in sight, is - to put it mildly - uncomfortable to imagine.Businesses decimated. Thousands of jobs lost. A recession that would make The Great Depression look like a dress rehearsal.Yet there have been glimmers of hope - green shoots', as they have been described - which suggest the rate of infections is starting to slow.It means that, although the peak of the UK's crisis is another week or two away, the Government's social distancing strategy is beginning to take effect.A study by the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine suggests the average number of daily contacts - how many people each of us comes into close contact with on any given day - has reduced from 2.6 to 0.62 since the lockdown. This means, in theory, the virus has nowhere left to go: if none of us are passing it on, no one new will be infected.Not that this means the lockdown restrictions can be lifted yet - far from it.Robert Jenrick, housing and communities secretary, has cautioned that nobody's pretending this will be over in a few weeks'. The BBC announced on Friday that it will be screening a new swathe of educational programmes for 14 weeks from 20 April - the surest sign yet that schools are not expected to return until at least after the summer holidays.The lockdown is working, say experts - but due to the nature of the virus we won't see the full benefit immediately. This weekend is key. One of the country's top epidemiologists Prof Neil Ferguson, who is advising the Government on the outbreak, told yesterday's Today programme: We can [expect to] see two possible options: a very slow plateauing decay of infections over time or perhaps a rather faster one.What's critical to determine that is how well people behave outside the household and how well they restrict their contact with others. And it's quite finely balanced at the current time.'He said moving around in the sunshine this weekend would move us to a slightly more pessimistic scenario' which would lead to high levels of infection for weeks and weeks rather than a rapid decline'.For now, we have to wait until the death and infection rate starts to fall. The big question, however, is this: what then? At the heart of the Government's strategy has been the need to protect the NHS from being overwhelmed - and it will be this which informs its next steps as we try to return to normal.Key to every decision has been our NHS intensive care capacity: at the start of the outbreak, 5,000 beds across the country.When those beds are full, people may start to die because those who need critical care support, such as ventilators, can't access it.But, initially, the Government seemed to adopt a softly, softly approach to the virus.People with symptoms and those who had been to countries where the virus was more prevalent were tested and isolated.Life, for the most of us, went on as normal. By early March, Italy - the first European country to be hit hard by the virus - had joined China in imposing a lockdown to contain the crisis. France, Spain, other European countries, and some US states, quickly followed suit.South Korea, Singapore and Germany engaged in aggressive test and trace' tactics - screening those with symptoms, quarantining the infected and tracing and isolating their contacts. But the UK - alone in Europe, aside from Sweden - stood firm and did neither.On March 12, despite protests from many in the scientific community, the Government stopped testing anyone but those who had been hospitalised with suspected Covid-19.Anyone with a cough or fever - the main symptoms of Covid-19 infection - was told to stay at home, and self-isolate for seven days. But children remained in school.Health officials said they might soon' go further, but they were waiting until this was strictly necessary. If bans on public gatherings and events were introduced too soon, fatigue' might set in - and people would find ways around them. It would also be better economically.Better to save such measures for when Britain was closer to the peak of the epidemic, Government advisers reasoned. But this strategy changed overnight with the publication of a report from the Imperial College Covid-19 Response Team, led by Prof Ferguson, on March 16. It suggested taking no action would lead to a demand for intensive care beds that would be 30 times above capacity, and lead to more than half a million deaths.Crucially, the modelling also found that existing social-distancing measures put demand at eight times greater than capacity, and would cause about 250,000 deaths.Within hours, Boris Johnson announced drastic action'. All Britons should work from home and avoid travel and social contact. Days later, schools closed, pubs and restaurants were ordered to shut and the lockdown began.The success of the initial soft approach will become apparent early this coming week, in the rate of infections and deaths.A few days later, the first signs of the lockdown impact will start to be seen in the figures, too. But neither will give the Government any indication as to what to do next, say leading epidemiologists.It's all a bit muddy, because these changes and interventions all came in within a few days of each other,' says Dr Michael Tildesley, an expert in the modelling of infectious disease at the University of Warwick. It's impossible to predict the effect each measure will have had individually.'Now, there are too many unknowns to simply lift the restrictions, he says. We don't know how many people have been infected because the Government has not been routinely testing those with symptoms.Prof Keith Neal, an epidemiologist in infectious disease from the University of Nottingham, says the global estimate is that there are roughly 1,000 infections for every one death - which puts the UK total, to date, at 4,313,000. But we don't know for sure whether those who have had the virus are, in fact, immune to having it again.While experts have said they have every reason' to think they might be, there are concerns. Other coronaviruses - including the four that cause common colds - do not trigger lasting immunity. So there is no model for how to proceed. The only option is for officials to analyse carefully what happens elsewhere.That begins with China. Travel restrictions in Hubei province - excluding Wuhan, the epicentre of the outbreak - were lifted last week. The lockdown in Wuhan, where there have been no new cases since last Monday, according to officials, is to be partially lifted on April 8.We know already, though, that the lockdown alone isn't enough to combat the virus. As experts have pointed out, we need to learn to live with it'. In China, some shops, cinemas and businesses were abruptly' closed again - suggesting relaxed measures may have prompted further infections.A second wave was also reported in Hong Kong after the two-week quarantine for travellers into the region was lifted and students returned at the end of term. Azra Ghani, Professor of Infectious Disease Epidemiology at Imperial College, says: Every country is facing exactly the same challenges. We're closely monitoring the situation in China. They have reduced transmission to very low levels, and now they are starting to open up their society again.We will see what happens in the coming weeks.'The Imperial report shows that - ironically - the more successful the attempt to contain the spread of infection, the more likely there is to be a significant second peak later in the year.Some experts hope one way out lies in herd immunity. This is when a large enough proportion of a population have had an infection, or been vaccinated. The disease ceases to spread easily - and essentially dies out. But of course, this relies on infection leading to lasting immunity, which, as we have said, isn't yet known.Prof Neal said if the herd immunity theory held true, then countries like Spain and Italy, which struggled to control their outbreaks, or Sweden and Singapore where shops and bars remained open, could have a lower second wave of infection.'Despite being one of the hardest hit areas of the UK, the infection rate in London is, at the moment, estimated to be only between two and five per cent, he said.If a second wave does come to the UK - as predicted in the late autumn - it could be even more catastrophic, coinciding with the annual flu season, which already places huge pressure on the NHS. Many experts say that aside from herd immunity the only other definitive way out is a vaccine - and neither are quick solutions.One possible exit strategy, modelled by Prof Ferguson and backed by a Harvard study last week, involves turning the restrictions on and off intermittently for two years - or until a vaccine becomes available. The aim would be to manage demand on health services by having several smaller peaks of infection rather than one large one.The on' switch would be triggered by the number of patients admitted to ICU who test positive for Covid-19. Prof Ferguson's simulation suggests if that exceeded 200 - four per cent of the UK's pre-outbreak capacity - social distancing measures and school closures could be reintroduced.Dr Tildesley explains: It will take time for interventions to have an effect, so if it is left later than this, even with suppression the peak ICU demand will exceed the capacity.'Herd immunity would continue to build during the periods when lockdowns were relaxed, so the infection rate would slow and there would be increasingly lengthy periods between the restrictions. But many are reluctant to impose intermittent lockdown strategies simply because people would struggle to adhere to them.Ivo Vlaev, Prof of Behavioural Science at Warwick Business School, says: Intermittent lockdown is not a good idea. We are creatures of habit and ever-changing guidelines may create problems. If the Government suddenly lifts the current restrictions and we are all free to do as we choose, we will flow back into our old way of life in many respects, as our ingrained habits will resurface.'Dr Harries has already implied that the Government may look to relax restrictions in stages, following the Chinese model. Over time, probably over the next six months, we will have a review [every three weeks],' she said.We need to keep that lid on, and then gradually we will be able to hopefully adjust some of the social distancing measures and gradually get us back to normal.'A study modelling the effects of ending the lockdown in Wuhan, from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, recommended this staggered approach. It found reintroducing the workforce over four weeks, and then reopening schools, could delay a second peak of infections by two months and make it easier to manage. Prof Neal says: I think we'll go through a staged relaxation of the measures. That might mean continuing to work from home if you can, and reopening pubs and restaurants but keeping tables 15ft apart, like they do in Singapore, or banning gatherings of more than 20 people so there's still a degree of social distancing.Football games could be played behind closed doors. Schools would most likely not go back until September, which could increase the spread. Universities may have to teach online.Ultimately, we may find the restrictions have to be put back in place again.'By the time we have a vaccine, we'll probably also have achieved herd immunity - or close to it, he also suggests.Another solution is lifting the measures in less-affected regions for up to six months at a time, as recommended by the Scientific Pandemic Influenza Group on Modelling. But ultimately, lifting restrictions relies on knowing who has been infected.This might mean mass antibody testing, and even the issuing of immunity certificates' already used in Germany. No reliable antibody tests are yet available, however: the Government said it wants to buy 17.5million subject to them working'.But the most likely approach was outlined by Prof Ferguson yesterday. He said there was a great deal of work under way' looking at how we could substitute some social distancing measures for less intensive' measures by the end of May, which would involving swab-testing any new cases that emerge, and rigorously tracing and testing their contacts in a bid to isolate any remaining virus'He added: The critical thing first is to get case numbers down, and then I'm hopeful in a few weeks we'll be able to move to a regime which will not be normal life - let me emphasise that - but will be somewhat more relaxed in terms of social distancing and the economy but rely more on testing.'Swab testing - currently at 12,000 a day - should be scaled up to 50,000 a day to achieve that, and technology such as mobile phone apps could be used to track people's contacts should they become infected.It is not clear which approach the Government will take - Prof Ferguson says it will be driven by the data'. And it remains to be seen whether any country can truly claim to have got it right.As Anders Tegnell, Sweden's state epidemiologist, told BBC Newsnight last week: I don't think anyone can be seriously confident of getting this right, since it's never happened before.Who will get it right? I'm not quite sure we will ever know, because it looks more and more like most countries will go through the same thing independently of the measures they are taking.'Any relaxation will be staged:cafe tables will be 15ft apart, gatherings will be limited to 20 people, schools will stay closed, football will be played behind closed doors…© Mail On Sunday",Papers

300,"Lack of coronavirus testing 'difficult to understand', says Dame Deirdre Hine","April 5, 2020 Sunday",International,thetimes.co.uk,1018,1018,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,"Dominic Kennedy, Investigations Editor","Lack of coronavirus testing 'difficult to understand', says Dame Deirdre Hine","She was one of the architects of Britain's pandemic response but now Dame Deirdre Hine can only watch with bewilderment at how ministers have failed to prepare for the basics.The distinguished public health consultant, who chaired the official review into the swine flu outbreak of 2009, said she was ""finding it difficult to understand"" the lack of sufficient testing.Tests are needed to measure how far a disease has spread into the population, informing health workers and the public as they try to combat the infection, she pointed out.She also warned that preparations now need to be put in place to cope with a huge rise in deaths.Dame Deirdre has served as president of the Royal Society of Medicine and British Medical Association and was the first woman chief medical officer for Wales, advising William Hague and John Redwood when each was Welsh secretary.She was asked by the health ministers of the four UK nations including Andy Burnham, now mayor of Greater Manchester, to lead the independent review into the hlN1 swine flu outbreak which killed 457 in 2009.Forced to stay indoors during the outbreak because of her age, Dame Deirdre sounded puzzled by Britain's delay in providing tests when she spoke to                    The Times.                   ""The testing together with the modelling would give a very much more precise indication of the course of the pandemic. That's the whole point. Either of them on their own is imperfect but that's almost stating the obvious, I would have thought,"" she said, breaking her self-imposed silence since the disease struck.""I am finding it difficult to understand why both the antigen testing [to diagnose those now carrying the virus] and the antibody testing [to identify those who have been infected] is taking so long to get off the ground.""Her report stressed the importance of data to ""model"" the threat posed by a new virus. She had urged officials handling future pandemics to consider gathering ""more robust information earlier to support decision-making"".Early predictions of the death toll from swine flu were vastly over-pessimistic. After just 29 deaths, public health chiefs forecast that 65,000 Britons might be killed with a minimum of 3,100 dead.Dame Deirdre's report in 2010 said ministers and officials had ""unrealistic expectations of modelling, which could not be reliable in the early phases when there was insufficient data. Once better data was available, modelling became extremely accurate.""She said: ""Particularly in the early stages of an outbreak the modelling assumptions are very imprecise. I think that has been shown again this time. While I understand, and epidemiologists would understand, why the results of the modelling change from time to time, the difficulty is this is much more difficult for the general public to understand and can be confusing and worrying.""We come back to this very sensitive point about modelling without testing. I think that if there is anything perhaps where the response could have been better this time it is on the whole question of testing.""Boris Johnson's near-lockdown of Britain was based on modelling by analysts who predicted 250,000 deaths unless the public practised social distancing and stayed at home. Their models used data from China, Italy and early British coronavirus hospital admissions.Dame Deirdre said: ""One of the other things that has struck me is that I am hoping that they have made plans for, macabre though it sounds, the appropriate disposal of bodies because that was something that came up, that the responsibilities for coping with large numbers of deceased individuals was unclear at the time of hlN1.""Her review found parts of Britain short of burial space and unprepared for a prolonged period of deaths.Ministers faced with swine flu drafted emergency plans to make death certification easier and reduce the role of coroners, two reforms which have now been adopted for coronavirus.Dame Deirdre was heartened to see some of her suggestions embraced. ""I am impressed by the fact that they do seem to have followed my recommendation of including behavioural scientists in the overall approach to this one,"" she said. These experts advised the gvernment that the public would be likely to support restrictions such as social distancing and the cancellation of mass gatherings.""One of the other recommendations I made was that the civil servants, the senior advisers in any pandemic, would inevitably become very tired, even if they did not contract the disease, and very clear arrangements should be made for backing them up with alternatives who could come to the fore.""That does seem to have been done as we are seeing replacements for the chief medical officer and even the prime minister in these daily press conferences.""Dame Deirdre has long been admired for her can-do attitude. When smallpox hit Britain in the 1970s, she set up a mobile vaccination clinic at Cardiff airport so holidaymakers could get a jab to enter Spain for their holidays. In 1995, she revolutionised Britain's cancer services by co-authoring a report which saw specialists replacing general surgeons.Speaking by telephone from her home in the Welsh capital she said: ""I am 82 so I am not allowed to go out, watching with interest and a great deal of sympathy the very difficult decisions that everyone is having to make.""I have hesitated to comment because I am so very well aware of the difficulties of coping with something on this scale.""hlN1 was a much milder disease. There were 400 or 500 deaths but it was nothing on this scale at all. I think we are slightly talking about apples and pears in this instance.""This one is on so much greater a scale that I would hesitate to criticise the strategic and operational aspects that have been applied in this case.""The only thing that I would emphasise is that the sooner we can get a better capacity for testing, both antigen and antibody tests, the clearer everything will be and that would be the thing that would be most reassuring for both the National Health Service and the general public.""dkennedy@thetimes.co.uk",Newspaper; Web Publication
301,"How long will the UK coronavirus lockdown last?;Less than 12 hours after the Prime Minister's historic address to the nation, the London Underground was still jammed with commuters","April 5, 2020 Sunday",International,telegraph.co.uk,1234,1234,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,"By Sarah Knapton, Science Editor","How long will the UK coronavirus lockdown last?Less than 12 hours after the Prime Minister's historic address to the nation, the London Underground was still jammed with commuters","Boris Johnson took the unprecedented step of curtailing individual freedoms to prevent the further spread of            coronavirus.The Prime Minister said that measures would be in place for three weeks-until April 13-and then reviewed. But given the expected trajectory of the disease, and the decisions taken by other countries who are ahead of Britain in terms of virus progression, it is unlikely the restrictions will be lifted then.•What the UK lockdown means for youFor a start, compared to most countries, the UK had a porous and half-hearted beginning to its isolation measures, with seemingly few people choosing to stay inside. Less than 12 hours after the Prime Minister's historic address to the nation on March 23, the London Underground was jammed with commuters (see video below), while builders were seen eating together in communal canteens, making a mockery of the Government's rule that no more than two people can gather together in public.Professor Susan Michie, Director of the University College London's Centre for Behaviour Change, warned that some people would simply not be able to carry out the measures, even if they wanted to.""Five million self-employed people are being left potentially destitute by the Government failing to offer financial supportas they have done for directly employed workers,"" she said. ""Since [statutory sick pay of] £94 is not enough to pay rent, bills, food for a family etc, they will be forced to carry on as usual.""The British Transport Police is now on hand to make sure only            critical workers are using the London Underground. But such an inauspicious start to the lockdown suggests the virus will spread further than it would have, had stricter measures been implemented earlier,            as they have in other countries. And it means that the measures we do have are likely to be in place for longer to ""flatten the curve"" in a way that would prevent a second dangerous peak.In addition, on April 1 the Government revealed figures that suggested the lockdown was starting to fray as data showed an ""uptick""            in the number of people using transport.The number of those using their cars and public transport, which had been consistently dropping since strict social distancing measures were introduced, rose for the first time.It is feared that sunny weather will prompt more people to break the rules and go outside and socialise as the Easter holidays begin.Mervyn King, the former Governor of the Bank of England, warned that there could be a ""rebellion"" if the measures are enforced for too long. Meanwhile, China has announced it will           finally be ending lockdown in Wuhanon April 8, a huge milestone for the country and a signal that the crisis-for them at least-is nearing its end. The city in Hubei province was the epicentre of the coronavirus outbreak.Yet it took more than two months of extremely draconian restrictions, including travel bans and quarantine zones, to achieve the level of containment seen in Wuhan. Britain is nowhere near that level of lockdown.And the Chinese restrictions were not lifted for more than 12 weeks after the first death, so if Britain follows a similar path, ours may need to be in place until the end of May/early June. Certainly, that is when the Government has said it expects cases to peak and then level out.However, from papers released recently, we know the Government is at least considering restricting movement for the rest of the year.The Scientific Pandemic Influenza Group on Modelling, which feeds into the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), proposed that because of the length of the outbreak, parts of the country could be placed in six-month lockdowns at a time, before being allowed more freedom. Professor Rowland Kao, the Sir Timothy O'Shea Professor of Veterinary Epidemiology and Data Science at the University of Edinburgh, said: ""It must be hoped that such measures will only last a relatively short time.""However, we must be prepared for this not to be the case, and for them to be in place for an extended period.""The next weeks until the Prime Minister's review will be crucial, as the unfolding epidemic will now be seen in real time, rather than through modelling, allowing experts to make more accurate predictions of when it will peak, and finally die away. It is also possible that after three weeks it becomes apparent that the costs to shutting down society far outweigh the benefit of slowing the spread and the government may choose to lift restrictions even before the peak.•Listen to the daily podcastProfessor Mark Woolhouse, Professor of Infectious Disease Epidemiology, University of Edinburgh, said: ""We now enter a phase of careful monitoring. We are looking for indicators first that the epidemic is slowing down and then for numbers of new cases to start to fall. ""After three weeks we will have to decide whether the restrictions need to be continued, can be relaxed, or can be relaxed temporarily with the expectation of imposing them again later. ""We must also monitor the damage that the lockdown is doing; damage to the economy, to education, to psychological well-being and to health and social care provision in the community. The impacts of this epidemic are too far reaching for policy decisions to be driven by epidemiology alone.""Professor Sheila Bird said that more cases in coming weeks would make it easier for the Government to predict how the epidemic is responding to lockdown measures, which will inform how long they remain in place. ""Once an epidemic takes hold, as now in UK, the country's own data - properly reported and interpreted - take precedence over modelling as the data tell us the actual toll which the epidemic is exacting,"" she said.""A huge amount can be inferred about the immediately forthcoming weeks from these data directly, including whether further policy changes are needed to reinforce social-distancing; for example in particular age groups.""Some experts are still concerned that the current restrictions do not go far enough while others say the government has been hit by an ""epidemic of action"", and is now bringing in measures that have little rationale. Professor Robert Dingwall, Professor of Sociology, at Nottingham Trent University, wrote in The Telegraph: ""It is another triumph of populism over science, of a capitulation to the demand to 'do something'. ""We are still seeing some notion that 'the people' are selfish and must be bullied and disciplined. ""The people are not selfish; they have behaved in ways that are individually rational but have collectively irrational results.""However Dr Andrea Collins, Senior Clinical Lecturer in Respiratory Medicine at the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine (LSTM), said: ""I believe that they have not quite gone far enough.

303,"How long will the UK coronavirus lockdown last?;Less than 12 hours after the Prime Minister's historic address to the nation, the London Underground was still jammed with commuters","April 5, 2020 Sunday",International,telegraph.co.uk,1234,1234,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,"By Sarah Knapton, Science Editor","How long will the UK coronavirus lockdown last?Less than 12 hours after the Prime Minister's historic address to the nation, the London Underground was still jammed with commuters","Boris Johnson took the unprecedented step of curtailing individual freedoms to prevent the further spread of            coronavirus.The Prime Minister said that measures would be in place for three weeks-until April 13-and then reviewed. But given the expected trajectory of the disease, and the decisions taken by other countries who are ahead of Britain in terms of virus progression, it is unlikely the restrictions will be lifted then.•What the UK lockdown means for youFor a start, compared to most countries, the UK had a porous and half-hearted beginning to its isolation measures, with seemingly few people choosing to stay inside. Less than 12 hours after the Prime Minister's historic address to the nation on March 23, the London Underground was jammed with commuters (see video below), while builders were seen eating together in communal canteens, making a mockery of the Government's rule that no more than two people can gather together in public.Professor Susan Michie, Director of the University College London's Centre for Behaviour Change, warned that some people would simply not be able to carry out the measures, even if they wanted to.""Five million self-employed people are being left potentially destitute by the Government failing to offer financial supportas they have done for directly employed workers,"" she said. ""Since [statutory sick pay of] £94 is not enough to pay rent, bills, food for a family etc, they will be forced to carry on as usual.""The British Transport Police is now on hand to make sure only            critical workers are using the London Underground. But such an inauspicious start to the lockdown suggests the virus will spread further than it would have, had stricter measures been implemented earlier,            as they have in other countries. And it means that the measures we do have are likely to be in place for longer to ""flatten the curve"" in a way that would prevent a second dangerous peak.In addition, on April 1 the Government revealed figures that suggested the lockdown was starting to fray as data showed an ""uptick""            in the number of people using transport.The number of those using their cars and public transport, which had been consistently dropping since strict social distancing measures were introduced, rose for the first time.It is feared that sunny weather will prompt more people to break the rules and go outside and socialise as the Easter holidays begin.Mervyn King, the former Governor of the Bank of England, warned that there could be a ""rebellion"" if the measures are enforced for too long. Meanwhile, China has announced it will           finally be ending lockdown in Wuhanon April 8, a huge milestone for the country and a signal that the crisis-for them at least-is nearing its end. The city in Hubei province was the epicentre of the coronavirus outbreak.Yet it took more than two months of extremely draconian restrictions, including travel bans and quarantine zones, to achieve the level of containment seen in Wuhan. Britain is nowhere near that level of lockdown.And the Chinese restrictions were not lifted for more than 12 weeks after the first death, so if Britain follows a similar path, ours may need to be in place until the end of May/early June. Certainly, that is when the Government has said it expects cases to peak and then level out.However, from papers released recently, we know the Government is at least considering restricting movement for the rest of the year.The Scientific Pandemic Influenza Group on Modelling, which feeds into the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), proposed that because of the length of the outbreak, parts of the country could be placed in six-month lockdowns at a time, before being allowed more freedom. Professor Rowland Kao, the Sir Timothy O'Shea Professor of Veterinary Epidemiology and Data Science at the University of Edinburgh, said: ""It must be hoped that such measures will only last a relatively short time.""However, we must be prepared for this not to be the case, and for them to be in place for an extended period.""The next weeks until the Prime Minister's review will be crucial, as the unfolding epidemic will now be seen in real time, rather than through modelling, allowing experts to make more accurate predictions of when it will peak, and finally die away. It is also possible that after three weeks it becomes apparent that the costs to shutting down society far outweigh the benefit of slowing the spread and the government may choose to lift restrictions even before the peak.•Listen to the daily podcastProfessor Mark Woolhouse, Professor of Infectious Disease Epidemiology, University of Edinburgh, said: ""We now enter a phase of careful monitoring. We are looking for indicators first that the epidemic is slowing down and then for numbers of new cases to start to fall. ""After three weeks we will have to decide whether the restrictions need to be continued, can be relaxed, or can be relaxed temporarily with the expectation of imposing them again later. ""We must also monitor the damage that the lockdown is doing; damage to the economy, to education, to psychological well-being and to health and social care provision in the community. The impacts of this epidemic are too far reaching for policy decisions to be driven by epidemiology alone.""Professor Sheila Bird said that more cases in coming weeks would make it easier for the Government to predict how the epidemic is responding to lockdown measures, which will inform how long they remain in place. ""Once an epidemic takes hold, as now in UK, the country's own data - properly reported and interpreted - take precedence over modelling as the data tell us the actual toll which the epidemic is exacting,"" she said.""A huge amount can be inferred about the immediately forthcoming weeks from these data directly, including whether further policy changes are needed to reinforce social-distancing; for example in particular age groups.""Some experts are still concerned that the current restrictions do not go far enough while others say the government has been hit by an ""epidemic of action"", and is now bringing in measures that have little rationale. Professor Robert Dingwall, Professor of Sociology, at Nottingham Trent University, wrote in The Telegraph: ""It is another triumph of populism over science, of a capitulation to the demand to 'do something'. ""We are still seeing some notion that 'the people' are selfish and must be bullied and disciplined. ""The people are not selfish; they have behaved in ways that are individually rational but have collectively irrational results.""However Dr Andrea Collins, Senior Clinical Lecturer in Respiratory Medicine at the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine (LSTM), said: ""I believe that they have not quite gone far enough. The 'absolutely' necessary to go to work is still being used by some when it is not required-I think we need permits across controlled areas to go to a workplace.""Recent modelling from the universities of Exeter, Bristol and Warwick suggested that without any measures at all, the epidemic would have peaked around 133 days after first person-to-person transmission in Britain, which happened around February 28. So the lockdown has the potential of curtailing the spread by around seven weeks. A welcome relief for people who could have been facing lockdown for most of the summer.",Newspaper; Web Publication
304,REBELS RISKING LIVES FOR TASTE OF FREEDOM,"April 6, 2020 Monday",International,The Daily Mail and Mail on Sunday (London),908,908,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,BY PAUL BRACCHI,REBELS RISKING LIVES FOR TASTE OF FREEDOM,"Twelve cyclists ride in formation in London's Regent's Park. It was, as far as they were concerned, just a normal Saturday. What other conclusion can be drawn from the picture of them pedalling furiously through the beauty spot seemingly without a care?On the day the coronavirus pandemic claimed 708 lives in Britain, they and countless others decided to ignore the Government's plea to remain indoors and instead head for the park, beach and river bank in droves to take advantage of the spring sunshine.Social distancing is our most important weapon in the fight against the unseen enemy. Yet it's nigh impossible to maintain a 360 degree, two metre circle of separation in a mini-peleton.The consequences of breaking that rule are brutally simple. An infected person will, on average, infect 2.5 others and they, in turn, will each pass it on to another 2.5, and so on and so forth.This means that if just one of the Lycra Lads' in Regent's Park had coronavirus, the chain set in motion at the weekend could potentially, after 30 days, have spread Covid-19 to more than 400 men, women or children.This is the terrifying metric behind their decision to cycle through Regent's Park in close proximity. They were not the only culprits. There were similar scenes up and down the country.Pictures of children playing street football in Leeds went viral. Visitors travelling to the Yorkshire Dales from more than 100 miles away were stopped by police. People were lazing on the banks of the River Cam in CambridgeIn Brighton, the city council put out an alert on Facebook (at lunchtime on Saturday) pleading with residents to stay away from the promenade. Too many people are on the seafront making social distancing impossible. Too many are using the seafront to meet up with friends,' it read.It was 3pm by the time I arrived and the cost of keeping it clear was taking its toll. One officer patrolling the area revealed that when transgressors were challenged, they were sworn at and, on at least one occasion, spat at.When I checked I had heard him correctly, he qualified his comment: I suppose I couldn't be sure he was spitting at me.' I think he was sure but wanted to play down the confrontation. In any case, spitting per se is indefensible in the current climate.Crisis fatigue' is the catch-all phrase experts call such lack of co-operation, that the danger from the virus is not great enough to warrant such a major suspension of liberties.The suspicion restrictions were being ignored by a significant minority was confirmed by the limited official data available. Frustration is believed to be especially prevalent among the young, something Lord King, governor of the Bank of England during the 2008 financial crisis, addressed at a recent conference hosted by the Policy Exchange think-tank.I fear that if we maintain the lockdown for too long,' said the 72-year-old peer, there will be a rebellion because a lot of younger people will say the younger generations have suffered over 20 years, why on earth is our future being put at stake to prolong the life expectancy of older people whose life expectancy might not be very high?We have cancelled their university education, we've cancelled the exams of people at school. This is going to have a long-lasting effect on their wellbeing and careers.'Government polling, not made public, it has now been reported, has identified teenagers as a problem' group who are not complying with the rules.Yet green shoots' of rebellion began to appear in the unlikely surroundings of the Plants Galore garden centre in Exeter last week. Outside is a sign: WE ARE OPEN TODAY.'It shouldn't be, of course; horticultural outlets are not considered essential' and so were required to close. Instead, owner Tony Joyner has stuck two (green) fingers up at the law and carried on selling his potted plants, bulbs and geraniums.Hence the reason why Mr Joyner, 52, whose family has run Plants Galore for 60 years, has been served with a council prohibition order - three, actually. I ripped them all up,' Mr Joyner, a father-of-four, declared defiantly.It's not that I don't care. I have two elderly parents, so I very much care. But my mother and father worked very hard to build up this business from scratch.If I don't open, then I go bankrupt. We are just 300 metres from Aldi where 30 trolleys of garden plants are selling in their car park. It cannot be fair.'Feeling forced to break the law is one thing but playing golf is another. Every day since the lockdown, people have been using the municipal Belfairs Golf Course in Leigh-on-Sea, Essex, says Councillor Stephen Aylen, despite the flags being removed.I've tried to tell them they shouldn't be playing and they always start shouting, saying they are only playing a few holes and what harm could it do.'Prohibition-style lock-ins perhaps epitomise the mood of defiance with police raids on pubs in Merseyside, Yorkshire and Sussex in the past week alone.How people behave during pandemics has been studied by experts such as Professor Susan Michie, director of the Centre for Behaviour Change at University College London and a member of the Scientific Pandemic Influenza Group on Behavioural Science which advises the Government. She says as the weather gets better more and more people will want to be outside' as they increasingly lose the motivation to stay indoors.The question is how many lives have already been put at risk?© Daily Mail",Papers
305,"Tighter lockdown will just delay coronavirus peak until autumn, ministers warned;Modelling for Government shows that implementing 'very stringent' lockdown measures will push peak back, not reduce it","April 6, 2020 Monday",International,telegraph.co.uk,899,899,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,"By Hayley Dixon and Martin Evans, CRIME CORRESPONDENT","Tighter lockdown will just delay coronavirus peak until autumn, ministers warnedModelling for Government shows that implementing 'very stringent' lockdown measures will push peak back, not reduce it","Government advisers have warned ministers that a tighter lockdown will lead to a second outbreak of coronaviruslater this year.Putting in place ""very stringent"" measures of the sort seen in Hong Kong and China could just delay the peak until after the restrictions were lifted, potentially into the autumn, official modelling found.It comes amid repeated warnings from ministers that the Government will tighten social distancing measures, including a ban on exercising outdoors, if it is shown that people are not complying with the rules.Senior police officers have warned that any further restrictions would be difficult to enforce.The Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) report on the ""potential impact of behavioural and social intervention"" casts doubt on whether a tighter lockdown would be effective. It shows that the largest number of deaths would occur if there was no intervention, which in the UK was estimated at around 500,000.If some measures were implemented to ""moderately reduce transmission"", which could include people changing their behaviour without intervention, then the deaths would have reduced slightly and the peak delayed, the summary, presented to the Government last month, concluded.However, a similarly high peak would be seen later in the year if ""very stringent behavioural and social interventions"" were put into effect, the scientists predicted.Whilst flattening the cases in the short term, ""when lifted, a large epidemic would likely follow"". Dependinghow long they were in place, this could peak in the autumn, ministers were told.The current strategy of ""behavioural and social interventions which further reduce transmission"" were most likely to flatten the curve with a much lower peak in the early summer.Imposing restrictions such as those in Wuhan, which saw people confined to their homes, and then rapidly lifting them ""may result in a subsequent second larger peak"", the experts said.A number of Asian countries have introduced increasingly stringent measures including fines and jail terms for breaching stay-at-home orders and making people wear tracking bracelets so those in enforced isolation do not leave their homes.If there is no transmission at all, some scientists have warned that there will be no ""herd immunity"" which will allow the virus to pass through the population and then die out.China, Hong Kong and Singapore have all reported an increase in cases in recent weeks when measures were relaxed and people took the opportunity to travel for the first time.Paul Griffiths, the president of the Police Superintendents' Association, said any tightening of the lockdown would create a challenge for officers.He told The Telegraph: ""I think we would do everything in our powers and within our resources to try to police it, but it will come with pragmatic challenges, not least in terms of how we use our resources to do it.""It is challenging to police this legislation, because we are all out of our comfort zone.""He also warned that, if further restrictions were imposed on the taking of exercise, there would be an impact on people's mental health.Jayne Meir, the Assistant Chief Constable of West Midlands Police, said that she could ""understand"" why further restrictions were looked at but added: ""It would be really difficult to police individuals on a daily basis. Everybody has to take personal responsibility for this. It's a collective responsibility to stay at home.""The Scientific Pandemic Influenza group on Behaviour (SPI-B), which makes up part of Sage, has warned that the Government needs to be transparent about what steps it is taking and why.In advice to ministers, the group said: ""People should be treated with respect, capable of taking decisions for themselves and managing personal risk.""The advice has emerged after a sunny weekend which saw parks and open spaces closed amid claims that people were not observing social distancing rules and warnings that more open spaces could be locked if people failed to comply.There are concerns public confidence could be lost if those in power with gardens and ample living space tell those who live in crowded conditions they cannot go to the park or exercise outdoors.The Communities Secretary, Robert Jenrick, said he has a ""lot of sympathy"" with those concerns, adding that he had spoken to ""a number"" of councils that closed parks over the weekend and asked them ""to be very judicious"".He insisted there are no ""imminent plans"" to impose greater restrictions after warnings that outside exercise could be banned and told BBC Breakfast: ""It would be very unfortunate if we had to do so and make it harder for people, particularly people who live in flats in towns and cities, to get the exercise they deserve.""One London authority closed a park over the weekend after reporting thousands of visitors flocking to it to enjoy the sunny, warm weather.However, councillor Gerald Vernon-Jackson, the chairman of the Local Government Association's culture, tourism and sport board, said: ""Councils know that parks are a lifeline for residents needing to get some exercise or fresh air and are great for physical and mental well-being.""This is why councils want to keep parks open, but people need to follow the social distancing advice, otherwise councils will be reluctantly forced to close them as a last resort to help prevent the coronavirus spreading.""",Newspaper; Web Publication
306,"Allow young people out of lockdown early to get country moving, say business experts;Researchers say 4.2 million young adults resuming daily lives could boost economy by £13b while shielding vulnerable groups","April 7, 2020 Tuesday",International,telegraph.co.uk,781,781,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,"By Sarah Knapton, Science Editor","Allow young people out of lockdown early to get country moving, say business expertsResearchers say 4.2 million young adults resuming daily lives could boost economy by £13b while shielding vulnerable groups","Allowing young people aged between 20 and 30 out of lockdown early could help get Britain moving again and avoid an ""extraordinary recession"", business experts have said.As the Government's chief scientific adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance, told the daily press conference that the epidemic curve appeared to be ""flattening off"", speculation is growing as to how the UK can escape from its lockdown.Researchers at the University of Warwick calculated that allowing 4.2 million young adults to resume their daily lives would boost the economy by £13 billion, while shielding more vulnerable age groups.Older adults could then be allowed out of lockdownlater, through a strategy of staged release using antibody testing to identify those who had already recovered from coronavirus.Andrew Oswald, Professor of Economics and Behavioural Science at Warwick, said: ""The rationale for lockdown is to save lives in the short to medium term.""However, severe damage is being done to the economy, future incomes, unemployment rates, levels of national debt and the freedoms we enjoy as a modern society. Before long, some balance will have to be struck.""Earlier this week, it emerged that mass antibody testing- to find out if people are immune - is at least a month away following disappointing trials, carried out by Oxford University, in a setback some experts said would hold up a lockdown exit strategy.Yet scientists say that polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests which look for current infections could still be used alongside contact tracing and self-isolation to lift the lockdown when case numbers stabilise.The Government has committed to carrying out 100,000 tests a day by the end of the month, although it is currently only managing 14,000.Jonathan Ball, Professor of Molecular Virology at the University of Nottingham, said: ""If you can start to get case numbers down to a manageable level, then you can use PCR testing to identify active cases, or at least a sufficiently large proportion of them, to allow isolation and then contact tracing from those points of infection.""This will require a much larger testing capacity than we have now.""Martin Hibberd, Professor of Emerging Infectious Disease at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said Britain could look to other countries to see how they have successfully managed exit strategies or avoided mass lockdowns. ""The successful strategies we have seen elsewhere involve very large-scale testing of the population and as much contact tracing as possible to enable the identification of people who are positive for SARS-CoV-2 and so able to transmit the disease,"" he said.""The people identified would need to self-quarantine for two weeks. While this strategy was difficult to achieve at the beginning of the outbreak, because of logistic problems in getting the testing done at such a large scale and our lack of experience at large scale contact tracing, we should now be able to overcome these problems.""The chief medical officer, Professor Chris Whitty, said no exit strategy would be considered until ""we are confident we are beyond the peak"". However, he said the Government was aware there may be ""indirect effects"" in diverting so many resources to fighting coronavirus, suggesting that there could be a tipping point at which lockdown is no longer beneficial for the country.Countries including the US and Sweden are now starting to question whether early modelling from Imperial College was too pessimistic and are revising down the number of deaths expected as well as the amount of intensive care beds that will be needed. Last weekend, Professor Neil Ferguson, part of the team responsible for the figures, said the number of deaths in Britain could now be as low as 7,000.A review published on Tuesday in The BMJ by Oxford University warned that many scientific studies rushed out in the race to understand the virus were of poor quality and should not be relied upon to inform policy or medical decisions.Dominic Raab, the Foreign Secretary, who is deputising for Boris Johnson while the Prime Minister is in hospital, said there are now 1,900 patients in clinical trials in over 100 hospitals. If a treatment is discovered, it could allow the population out of lockdown sooner.Highlighting the benefits of allowing young people out of lockdown, Nick Powdthavee, Professor of Behavioural Economics at Warwick Business School, said: ""It could allow our society and economy to move forward in the footsteps of the young, while allowing older workers to share the economic rewards by providing supervision, mentoring, and managerial assistance electronically through sources such as Skype, Zoom, and Facetime.""",Newspaper; Web Publication

Data showed more than 50,000 people have been tested per day in the latter.Matt Hancock, the health secretary, said last week that the government was aiming to carry out 100,000 coronavirus tests per day in England by the end of April - a significant increase from the 10,000 per day being carried out at the time of the announcement.However, there are still doubts about whether that target can be achieved, especially as some of the government's previous pledges on testing have failed to materialise.Dominic Raab, the foreign secretary, has said the UK government is focused on getting past the peak of the epidemic and it would make other decisions on policy ""in due course"".""The number one priority is to stop the spread and to make sure that we can get past the peak and that is the overriding focus of the government right now. Other decisions can be considered in the light of the evidence that we are taking in due course,"" Mr Raab said.In an interview with the FT's​ Alphaville, Prof Ferguson revealed the prime minister and his cabinet had been aware of results from the Imperial team's report, which warned of as many as 250,000 deaths from the virus, up to two weeks before social-distancing measures were ramped up last month.""The government were aware of what our results were showing certainly in the previous week, and some of [the results] in the previous two weeks,"" he said.Prof Ferguson added that although it looked as though the paper had directly informed the decision to intensify restrictive measures on social contact, it had been part of a much wider range of advice given to the government.""The paper came out that day partly because there was pressure on government to be showing the modelling informing policymaking, so we worked very hard to get that paper out at that time,"" he said.""It looked, therefore, like that was the paper that informed policymaking, but in fact a much wider range of scientific advice and modelling advice had gone into government in the previous two weeks, all of which pointed in that direction.""The epidemiologist also warned there were ""downsides"" to the strategy of suppression, which has been adopted by the government to reduce deaths, as a process of relaxing and reintroducing restrictions could be difficult for the public to accept.""There's quite a lot of behavioural science under way at the moment suggesting that a lot of people would find that a hard strategy to swallow and accept,"" Prof Ferguson said, adding that scientists were looking into ways to substitute ""draconian"" social-distancing measures for a more extensive testing system.",Newspaper; Web Publication
309,Stricter lockdown now 'will lead to fresh wave of virus';Coronavirus ; Restrictions,"April 7, 2020 Tuesday",International,The Daily Telegraph (London),750,750,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,Hayley Dixon; Martin Evans,Stricter lockdown now 'will lead to fresh wave of virus'Coronavirus ; Restrictions,"GOVERNMENT advisers have warned ministers that a tighter lockdown will lead to a second outbreak of coronavirus later this year.Putting in place ""very stringent"" measures, such as those seen in Hong Kong and China, could just delay the peak until after the restrictions were lifted, potentially into the autumn, official modelling found.It comes amid repeated warnings from ministers that the Government will tighten social distancing measures including a ban on exercising outdoors if it is shown that people are not complying with the rules.Last night senior police officers warned that any further restrictions would be difficult to enforce.The Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) report on the ""potential impact of behavioural and social intervention"" casts doubt on whether a tighter lockdown would be effective.It shows that the largest number of deaths would occur if there was no intervention, which in the UK has been estimated at around 500,000.If some measures were implemented to ""moderately reduce transmission"", which could include people changing their own behaviour without intervention, then the deaths would have reduced slightly and the peak delayed, the summary presented to the Government last month concluded. However, a similarly high peak would be seen later in the year if ""very stringent behavioural and social interventions"" similar to those implemented in Hong Kong and Singapore were put into effect, the scientists predicted.Ministers were told that while flattening the cases in the short term, ""when lifted, a large epidemic would likely follow. Depending how long they were in place, this could peak in autumn"".The current strategy of ""behavioural and social interventions which further reduce transmission"" were most likely to flatten the curve with a much lower peak in the early summer. Imposing restrictions such as those in Wuhan which saw people confined to their homes and then rapidly lifting them ""may result in a subsequent second larger peak"", the experts said.A number of Asian countries have introduced increasingly stringent measures including fines and jail terms for breaching stay-at-home orders and making people wear tracking bracelets. If there is no transmission at all then some scientists have warned that there will be no ""herd immunity"" which would allow the virus to pass through the population and then die out. China, Hong Kong and Singapore have all reported an increase in cases in recent weeks when measures were relaxed and people took the opportunity to travel for the first time.Paul Griffiths, president of the Police Superintendents' Association, said any tightening of the lockdown would create a challenge for officers.He told The Daily Telegraph: ""I think we would do everything in our powers and within our resources to try to police it, but it will come with pragmatic challenges, not least in terms of how we use our resources to do it.""He also warned that if further restrictions were imposed on exercising there would be an impact on people's mental health. Jayne Meir, assistant chief constable of West Midlands Police, said: ""It would be really difficult to police individuals on a daily basis. Everybody has to take personal responsibility for this. It's a collective responsibility to stay at home.""The Scientific Pandemic Influenza group on Behaviours (SPI-B), which makes up part of Sage, has warned that the Government needs to be transparent about what steps it is taking and why.In advice to ministers it said: ""People should be treated with respect, capable of taking decisions for themselves and managing personal risk.""The advice emerged after a sunny weekend which saw parks and open spaces closed amid claims that people were not observing social distancing rules and warnings that more open spaces could be locked if people do not comply. There are concerns public confidence could be lost if those in power with gardens and ample living space tell those who live in crowded conditions they cannot go to the park or exercise outdoors.Robert Jenrick, the Communities Secretary, insisted there are no ""imminent plans"" to impose greater restrictions after warnings that outside exercise could be banned. ""It would be very unfortunate if we had to do so and make it harder for people, particularly people who live in flats in towns and cities, to get the exercise they deserve,"" he told the BBC's Breakfast.'People should be treated with respect, capable of making decisions and managing personal risk'",Newspaper
310,"How long will the UK coronavirus lockdown last?;Less than 12 hours after the Prime Minister's historic address to the nation, the London Underground was still jammed with commuters","April 7, 2020 Tuesday",International,telegraph.co.uk,1329,1329,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,"By Sarah Knapton, Science Editor","How long will the UK coronavirus lockdown last?Less than 12 hours after the Prime Minister's historic address to the nation, the London Underground was still jammed with commuters","Boris Johnson took the unprecedented step of curtailing individual freedoms to prevent the further spread of            coronavirus.The Prime Minister said that measures would be in place for three weeks-until April 13-and then reviewed. But given the expected trajectory of the disease, and the decisions taken by other countries who are ahead of Britain in terms of virus progression, it is unlikely the restrictions will be lifted then.Dominic Raab, deputising for Boris Johnson, said on Tuesday that the worst thing the country could do was ""take its foot off the peddle"" in terms of the strict social distancing measures when asked whether the Government had decided to extend the lockdown.""In terms of the review, we are not at that stage yet,"" he said. ""We will take any decision when the time is right, based on the facts and the scientific and medical advice.""Our number one and overriding focus right now is on conveying the key message which is that everyone needs to keep adhering to this guidance.""•What the UK lockdown means for youFor a start, compared to most countries, the UK had a porous and half-hearted beginning to its isolation measures, with seemingly few people choosing to stay inside. Less than 12 hours after the Prime Minister's historic address to the nation on March 23, the London Underground was jammed with commuters (see video below), while builders were seen eating together in communal canteens, making a mockery of the Government's rule that no more than two people can gather together in public.Professor Susan Michie, Director of the University College London's Centre for Behaviour Change, warned that some people would simply not be able to carry out the measures, even if they wanted to.""Five million self-employed people are being left potentially destitute by the Government failing to offer financial supportas they have done for directly employed workers,"" she said. ""Since [statutory sick pay of] £94 is not enough to pay rent, bills, food for a family etc, they will be forced to carry on as usual.""The British Transport Police is now on hand to make sure only            critical workers are using the London Underground. But such an inauspicious start to the lockdown suggests the virus will spread further than it would have, had stricter measures been implemented earlier,            as they have in other countries. And it means that the measures we do have are likely to be in place for longer to ""flatten the curve"" in a way that would prevent a second dangerous peak.In addition, on April 1 the Government revealed figures that suggested the lockdown was starting to fray as data showed an ""uptick""            in the number of people using transport.The number of those using their cars and public transport, which had been consistently dropping since strict social distancing measures were introduced, rose for the first time.It is feared that sunny weather will prompt more people to break the rules and go outside and socialise as the Easter holidays begin.Mervyn King, the former Governor of the Bank of England, warned that there could be a ""rebellion"" if the measures are enforced for too long. Meanwhile, China has announced it will           finally be ending lockdown in Wuhanon April 8, a huge milestone for the country and a signal that the crisis-for them at least-is nearing its end. The city in Hubei province was the epicentre of the coronavirus outbreak.Yet it took more than two months of extremely draconian restrictions, including travel bans and quarantine zones, to achieve the level of containment seen in Wuhan. Britain is nowhere near that level of lockdown.And the Chinese restrictions were not lifted for more than 12 weeks after the first death, so if Britain follows a similar path, ours may need to be in place until the end of May/early June. Certainly, that is when the Government has said it expects cases to peak and then level out.However, from papers released recently, we know the Government is at least considering restricting movement for the rest of the year.The Scientific Pandemic Influenza Group on Modelling, which feeds into the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), proposed that because of the length of the outbreak, parts of the country could be placed in six-month lockdowns at a time, before being allowed more freedom. Professor Rowland Kao, the Sir Timothy O'Shea Professor of Veterinary Epidemiology and Data Science at the University of Edinburgh, said: ""It must be hoped that such measures will only last a relatively short time.""However, we must be prepared for this not to be the case, and for them to be in place for an extended period.""The next weeks until the Prime Minister's review will be crucial, as the unfolding epidemic will now be seen in real time, rather than through modelling, allowing experts to make more accurate predictions of when it will peak, and finally die away. It is also possible that after three weeks it becomes apparent that the costs to shutting down society far outweigh the benefit of slowing the spread and the government may choose to lift restrictions even before the peak.•Listen to the daily podcastProfessor Mark Woolhouse, Professor of Infectious Disease Epidemiology, University of Edinburgh, said: ""We now enter a phase of careful monitoring. We are looking for indicators first that the epidemic is slowing down and then for numbers of new cases to start to fall. ""After three weeks we will have to decide whether the restrictions need to be continued, can be relaxed, or can be relaxed temporarily with the expectation of imposing them again later. ""We must also monitor the damage that the lockdown is doing; damage to the economy, to education, to psychological well-being and to health and social care provision in the community. The impacts of this epidemic are too far reaching for policy decisions to be driven by epidemiology alone.""Professor Sheila Bird said that more cases in coming weeks would make it easier for the Government to predict how the epidemic is responding to lockdown measures, which will inform how long they remain in place. ""Once an epidemic takes hold, as now in UK, the country's own data - properly reported and interpreted - take precedence over modelling as the data tell us the actual toll which the epidemic is exacting,"" she said.""A huge amount can be inferred about the immediately forthcoming weeks from these data directly, including whether further policy changes are needed to reinforce social-distancing; for example in particular age groups.""Some experts are still concerned that the current restrictions do not go far enough while others say the government has been hit by an ""epidemic of action"", and is now bringing in measures that have little rationale. Professor Robert Dingwall, Professor of Sociology, at Nottingham Trent University, wrote in The Telegraph: ""It is another triumph of populism over science, of a capitulation to the demand to 'do something'. ""We are still seeing some notion that 'the people' are selfish and must be bullied and disciplined. ""The people are not selfish; they have behaved in ways that are individually rational but have collectively irrational results.""However Dr Andrea Collins, Senior Clinical Lecturer in Respiratory Medicine at the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine (LSTM), said: ""I believe that they have not quite gone far enough. The 'absolutely' necessary to go to work is still being used by some when it is not required-I think we need permits across controlled areas to go to a workplace.""Recent modelling from the universities of Exeter, Bristol and Warwick suggested that without any measures at all, the epidemic would have peaked around 133 days after first person-to-person transmission in Britain, which happened around February 28. So the lockdown has the potential of curtailing the spread by around seven weeks. A welcome relief for people who could have been facing lockdown for most of the summer.",Newspaper; Web Publication
311,Boris Johnson's illness is a message to us all about the true nature of coronavirus;Nothing that has happened so far brings home more clearly that we are in a collective struggle,"April 7, 2020 Tuesday",International,The Guardian (London),671,671,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,Martin Kettle,Boris Johnson's illness is a message to us all about the true nature of coronavirusNothing that has happened so far brings home more clearly that we are in a collective struggle,"Boris Johnson's move last night into intensive care in London's St Thomas' hospital marks a turning point in Britain's national Covid-19 crisis. On one level it is just one more personal crisis for another of the more than 1.3 million human victims of the virus around the world. But on another level it is much more than that, and its full significance for Britain has not yet been properly understood.The incapacity of any prime minister at any time always throws a government machine into confusion. That's no different in the case of Johnson's sickness than in the many previous cases in British history in which other prime ministers have been afflicted by illness or the need for surgery. But the machine will adapt. It's what government machines do.What is different this time, and much more important, is the wider potential resonance across the country of Johnson's worsening condition and his hospitalisation. The prime minister has been struck down by something that threatens every person in the land directly every day. Most of us are dutifully following the lockdown advice in our hidden away anonymity to defy it. Only a minority of us have caught the coronavirus. Many of us know no one in our close circle who has had to go to hospital because of it.But we all know Johnson. We all know what and who he is. Even my three-year-old granddaughter knows that it is Boris Johnson who has said she can't go outside. Johnson's medical crisis is not just his own. It speaks more widely to the nation. It conveys an unexpected, brutal and disturbing message. Whether we voted for him or not, Johnson is this country's elected leader. He's in charge. In a crisis, the buck stops with him. But in this crisis, our prime minister is receiving oxygen in an intensive care unit and is not in a fit state to govern.The words ""Boris Johnson"" and ""seriousness"" are not often encountered together. He has spent much of his life breaking rules and behaving self-indulgently. But his hospitalisation overleaps all that. I suspect it also takes this country into a more serious place than it has previously reached in the battle with Covid-19. The thought of a prone Johnson surrounded by the doctors, nurses and equipment that were so powerfully glimpsed in the intensive care department of another London hospital on Monday night's BBC news bulletins will come as a shock to supporters and opponents of the prime minister alike. Millions will have discovered a deep well of compassion towards Johnson that they never suspected they could possess.The leader who is struck down amid the fight for survival is a potent archetype in art and literature. The wounded chieftain is a deep point of reference in the history of many cultures of every tradition, and in every part of these islands from at least Arthurian times onwards. Johnson may never acquire the legendary status of an Arthur, but the shock of the news of his hospitalisation reaches out nevertheless into every corner of the country.There will, glumly, be some who respond to Johnson's distress without compassion of any kind. Some will simply not care. For most, though, the effect is likely to be more sobering and stiffening. Nothing that has yet happened in this outbreak brings home more clearly that we are in a collective struggle. Nothing is more likely to supply a voice in people's heads when they ask themselves whether they should stick to the state's advice to self-isolate and maintain distance from others. Nothing is more likely to nudge our behaviour in a more responsible and sensibly cautious direction.Boris Johnson's political career has often been divisive. But his vulnerability to the virus and his current distress tell a different and ultimately more important story. We are living through a time when the shadow of death is passing across the land more fatefully than normal. Perhaps the most improbable thing in Johnson's life is that in this dark hour he has surprised us into the need to be serious. Martin Kettle is a Guardian columnist",Newspaper
312,Every little helps - but this doesn't,"April 8, 2020 Wednesday",International,thetimes.co.uk,921,921,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,Alistair Osborne,Every little helps - but this doesn't,"So that's what the Tesco boss David Lewis means by ""Together, we can do this"": £585 million of business rates relief from the taxpayer, effectively funding a £635 million dividend to shareholders. How's that for togetherness?Yes, Tesco's decision to pay a final 6.5p-a-share dividend is more nuanced than that. But Britain's biggest supermarket chain has broken one unwritten rule of this crisis: that companies that take government support don't then turn on the gushers for investors.It's not a tricky concept to grasp. And while Tesco might see criticism as a cheap shot, the payout's left the company wide open to political flak. Indeed, it's not the sort of thing you'd expect from a board chaired by as astute an operator as John Allan - president, no less, of the CBI.True, Mr Lewis made a robust case for paying the dividend - one ahead of 5.8p forecasts, to boot. It reflects last year's performance, before Covid-19 and when underlying operating profits rose 13.5 per cent to £2.96 billion. Tesco doesn't have a liquidity problem, in fact the opposite. The payment goes to people ""saving for retirement"", spanning almost 250,000 individual shareholders, most with ""less than 1,000 shares"". And shouldn't they be rewarded for their loyalty after years of zero or meagre dividends - since Mr Lewis turned up in 2014 and unearthed a £263 million accounting black hole?Moreover, he emphasised that his efforts ""feeding the nation"" - otherwise known as selling people stuff at a profit - have left Tesco with extra costs. He predicts £650 million to £925 million, depending on whether the crisis lasts three months or twenty weeks: partly the cost of recruiting 45,000 more staff to replace those off sick and stepping up home shopping capacity by a fifth. As he put it, ""every pound we receive in rates relief"" will be spent to ""support Britain's shoppers"".Against that? Well, for starters, that shareholders are already getting a £5 billion special dividend from the sale of the Asian business, so hardly need more treats - especially when the company is withdrawing financial guidance. Then the extra costs have been partly offset by a sales bonanza: a 30 per cent jump over the early weeks of the crisis, even if the selfish stockpiling has slowed. On top of that, unlike most investors, Tesco hasn't seen its capital destroyed. The shares have broadly held up: 222¾p, down a smidgeon yesterday.Whatever his heroics, neither can Mr Lewis feed the nation the way stay-at-homers want. He admits that at least 85 per cent of ""all food bought will require a visit to a store"". Wouldn't the cash for the dividend be better spent on extra drivers to deliver to granny? One Treasury select committee member, the Labour MP Rushanara Ali, was already kicking off over a year's business rates holiday for a company ""doing extremely well"". And now Tesco's divvy has spiced things up.Yes, it's politics. But the optics around board decisions have rarely been so critical. Tesco should have deferred the dividend and reviewed it after the crisis, alongside whether it should be taking tax breaks from a skint nation. Better than looking like a business that wants to have its cake and eat it.                   Clear as mud                   Another victory for nudge theory. As if the government hasn't had enough trouble with that over social distancing. Now its pitfalls have been underlined by Sam Woods. Who he? The Prudential Regulation Authority chief, whose efforts to corral UK insurers into line has so far produced one flagrant outlier.On Tuesday last week he penned a missive urging insurers ""considering any distributions to shareholders"" to ""pay close attention to the need to protect policyholders"". A big hint, then, that dividends were a Covid-19 no-no.The upshot? Legal & General boss Nigel Wilson rushing out a statement late on Friday, confirming its ""current intention"" to pay its £752 million divvy - after checking that it was still OK with the PRA. Five days on, Mr Woods looks to have hardened his position. After Aviva, RSA, Direct Line and Hiscox halted their payouts, the PRA swiftly welcomed ""the prudent decision from some insurance companies"". Note ""some"". So does that mean the likes of M&G and Admiral must fall into line? Or must L&G revisit its ""current"" intentions?It's not exactly clear. Yes, L&G doesn't have the general insurance exposure of some rivals. But Mr Woods' nudging has produced a muddle. Its highlighted something else, too: an apparent lack of faith in his own prudential regulation.                   Bank credit                   Barclays boss Jes Staley has had some stick here recently - lately for taking his 2019 bonus despite canning the dividend. So credit where it's due.

313,"We don't have a clear exit strategy, says top scientist","April 8, 2020 Wednesday",International,The Independent (United Kingdom),598,598,England & Wales,CONRAD DUNCAN,"We don't have a clear exit strategy, says top scientist","The UK does not have a ""clear exit strategy"" for resuming normal life following the nationwide lockdown imposed in March, according to a leading scientist advising the government on its response to coronavirus.Professor Neil Ferguson, an epidemiologist from Imperial College London's influential Covid-19 response team, said testing will need to be significantly increased to allow people to return to some form of normality, but warned there was ""no master plan"" guiding the government's decisions.As research teams around the world have learnt more about the coronavirus pandemic, governments have been trying to find an ""optimal strategy"", which prevents health services from collapsing but allows some economic and social activity to take place, Prof Ferguson said.""Obviously what we would like to find is a strategy which allows us to go back to - it won't be normal life but a bit closer to normal life, and suppresses transmission,"" he told the Financial Times. ""That almost will certainly involve something akin to [South] Korea, massively ramping up testing, and contact-tracing. But it's not clear even in Korea - and I've seen some of the analysis done there - that they can really relax all their social distancing and yet keep transmission low.""The UK government has faced criticism in recent days over its failure to test people for Covid-19 on a similar scale to countries such as South Korea and Germany. Data showed more than 50,000 people have been tested per day in the latter.Matt Hancock, the health secretary, said last week that the government was aiming to carry out 100,000 coronavirus tests per day in England by the end of April - a significant increase from the 10,000 per day being carried out at the time of the announcement. However, there are still doubts about whether that target can be achieved, especially as some of the government's previous pledges on testing have failed to materialise.In an interview with the FT's Alphaville, Prof Ferguson revealed the prime minister and his cabinet had been aware of results from the Imperial team's report, which warned of as many as 250,000 deaths from the virus, up to two weeks before social-distancing measures were ramped up last month. ""The government were aware of what our results were showing certainly in the previous week, and some of [the results] in the previous two weeks,"" he said.Prof Ferguson added that although it looked as though the paper had directly informed the decision to intensify restrictive measures on social contact, it had been part of a much wider range of advice given to the government. ""The paper came out that day partly because there was pressure on government to be showing the modelling informing policymaking, so we worked very hard to get that paper out at that time,"" he said.""It looked, therefore, like that was the paper that informed policymaking, but in fact a much wider range of scientific advice and modelling advice had gone into government in the previous two weeks, all of which pointed in that direction.""The epidemiologist also warned there were ""downsides"" to the strategy of suppression, which has been adopted by the government to reduce deaths, as a process of relaxing and reintroducing restrictions could be difficult for the public to accept.""There's quite a lot of behavioural science under way at the moment suggesting that a lot of people would find that a hard strategy to swallow and accept,"" Prof Ferguson said, adding that scientists were looking into ways to substitute ""draconian"" social-distancing measures for a more extensive testing system.",Newspaper

318,We must be prepared to live with Covid-19;The Cabinet must change its disastrous wartime narrative and treat this crisis for what it really is,"April 9, 2020 Thursday",International,The Daily Telegraph (London),849,849,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,SHERELLE JACOBS,We must be prepared to live with Covid-19The Cabinet must change its disastrous wartime narrative and treat this crisis for what it really is,"There is nothing worse than a bad metaphor in a crisis. Just as Blair and Bush declared a ""war on terror"" in the wake of 9/11, Trump is ""mobilising"" against a mysterious ""Chinese virus"". Meanwhile Britain has created a ""War Cabinet"" and instructed its Home Front to stay indoors while invoking the Blitz spirit.As in 2003, the public, more interested in the balance of evidence than bellicose bluster, is on side for now. Although modelling has found that tougher lockdown restrictions would only delay the peak until autumn, most people are willing to sit tight for a couple more weeks, to see if the crisis ""peaks"", as new cases fall.Still, a crunch point looms: some ministers - such as Michael Gove and Matt Hancock - miscalculate that they can keep lockdown going for months if cases don't drop quickly enough. The opposing Cabinet faction - reportedly including Dominic Raab and Rishi Sunak - will struggle; when you are stuck in a trap it's hard to gain momentum. Boris Johnson and Dominic Cummings unwittingly laid it when they were pressured into ditching herd immunity.If the duumvirate had not been struck by illness, I have no doubt that by now they would have displayed the clarity of mind to realise that their original U-turn - from herd immunity to lockdown - was a mistake and must now be followed by an inevitable reverse U-turn. With no vaccine, and unable to shut down businesses indefinitely, the Government was always going to have to switch back to Plan A after demonstrating it had done everything it could to save lives without permanently ruining the economy.Perhaps they might have done this by framing the outbreak of Covid-19 as more similar to the Aids crisis than the Second World War. That is, to explain that a nasty new virus is suddenly in our midst and that scientists have limited knowledge of how it spreads, how to cure it or whether it might mutate. Neither superforecasters nor epidemiologists can project its impact. Nor can we trust the death figures for now because this virus is statistically difficult to track. (Just as in the Eighties we had to get our heads around a deadly illness that did not directly kill people, we must now find a way to distinguish between those who die with Covid and victims who die of it.) Lockdown should be sold for what it is - a way of buying time for the health service, while the scientists get to know their new subject better and politicians get a grip on the best way forward.Instead, wartime bluster is unrealistically raising expectations. The media's desperate search for the Government's secret weapon to blast the virus - before finally settling on the idea that the silver bullet must be mass testing, and skewering ministers and PHE over their related failings - being a striking example.It is also validating obsolete politics.The fact that Tony Blair has in recent days egged on No 10 to go further with its War Cabinet model, appointing a minister for testing, is surely sign enough that the approach is bunkum. The view that efficient logistics can beat a complex virus is not surprising from an ideological managerialist like Blair. But from this ""disruptive"" new Government it is disappointing.Time to ditch the military analogies.Coronavirus may be something we must simply learn to live with. Such a message may be against the better nature of centrist politicians who have spent the last 30 years protecting us from the Other (Saddam Hussein) and ourselves (nativist populism). But they can yet change their attitude, and compellingly sell the truth of the matter to the public.Here is an opportunity for No 10's behavioural scientists to come into their own. Small but significant behaviour changes like hand-washing and a new social-distancing etiquette will be vital to rallying the public round the new common goal of protecting the most vulnerable while keeping the world turning. So, too, local volunteer schemes, such as weekend shops for self-isolating elderly people.A Cummingsian three-word slogan would also help. Something that washes away the previous sins of politicians and plays into our evolutionary instincts like ""Take Back Control"" (humans hate to lose things). Something that, like all good political slogans, has that slight cheap perfume of something you've read in a self-help book or heard in a hundred pop songs. I invite Mr Cummings to dream up something more inspired than my own suggestion: along the lines that Britain must ""Keep On Going"".This will give us the temporary engine power to get out of this rut. But it's a hard road ahead. As well as contending with global economic collapse, our leaders will have to debate controversial long-term solutions like biometric surveillance. They will have to weigh up protecting at-risk groups with intruding on their freedoms.Such a change in political vision for dealing with Covid-19 will not be easy. Dominic Raab can be a stand-in lost in the footnotes. Or he can take a stand, and change the genre of this disastrous wartime plot.follow Sherelle Jacobs on Twitter @Sherelle_E_J; read more at www.telegraph.co.uk/opinion",Newspaper
319,Young people 'should be first to be released from the lockdown',"April 9, 2020 Thursday",International,thetimes.co.uk,620,620,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,"Oliver Wright, Policy Editor",Young people 'should be first to be released from the lockdown',"Young people who are not living with their parents could be allowed to travel freely before the rest of the population, under Covid-19 plans being discussed in Whitehall.Officials are studying a report from the economics and behavioural science department at Warwick University which said that about four million people between the ages of 20 and 30 should resume a semi-normal life as part of the first stage in easing the lockdown. The paper, to which the former cabinet secretary Lord O'Donnell contributed, argued that this group was least at risk from the virus and was financially the hardest hit.The author of the report, Andrew Oswald, said: ""So far we have quite rightly followed the epidemiological evidence.

We can't sit in our houses until Christmas.""The development comes as a think tank warned that younger workers would pay the highest price in reduced living standards from the crisis.The Resolution Foundation said there was increasing evidence that younger people had been more likely to lose their jobs than older workers and those leaving education and looking for jobs would also be hit hard.""With over a million under-25s entering the labour market for the first time each year . . . today's young education leavers will pay a high price from the necessary public health measures being taken,"" Torsten Bell, the organisation's chief executive, said.Ministers are grappling with how to ease restrictions amid warnings that any reduction in the lockdown is likely to lead to more cases.A confidential European Union paper on plans to reduce restrictions warned starkly that ""any level of [gradual] relaxation of the confinement will inevitably lead to a corresponding increase in new cases"".However, with a vaccine most likely to be a year away there is growing pressure on ministers to publish a plan to gradually return life to normal while minimising the number of people who will get seriously ill.A unit has been set up in Downing Street and the Cabinet Office to look at options and advise the cabinet alongside the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies.Professor Oswald's analysis points to estimates showing that the fatality rate for Covid-19 in the 20-30 age group is 0.03 per cent, and the critical-care rate 0.06 per cent.It says such a release would not therefore be ""costless in human suffering"" but adds: ""There would be tragic cases; [but] in the current situation there is no riskless way forward.""The analysis says the effects of releasing this group from lockdown ""would be far, far smaller than those from any general release of the population"".Professor Oswald said that he had researched the paper - aimed at senior policy makers in Whitehall - because ""we do need ideas"" on how to eventually end the lockdown.He added that 20 to 30-year-olds represented a fifth of the economy and said such moves could allow the limited reopening of bars and restaurants - but only if those people were in the right age category.Professor Oswald said that the plan would also be clearly explained to the public and could allow a semblance of normal life to begin again while minimising health risks. The government said it would not block furloughed employees from taking on additional work during the coronavirus crisis. The move is designed to boost the economy and help badly hit sectors such as care providers and farmers, who face difficulty with the coming harvest.Universal credit applications in the UK surged to ten times their normal level in the two weeks leading up to April 1, but millions of people are also about to be furloughed, with their jobs placed on hold and 80 per cent of their salaries being paid under a government scheme.",Newspaper; Web Publication
320,Some restrictions may be lifted by middle of May;Coronavirus,"April 9, 2020 Thursday",International,The Daily Telegraph (London),885,885,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,Sarah Knapton,Some restrictions may be lifted by middle of MayCoronavirus,"Exit strategy LOCKDOWN could be lifted when new cases consistently fall below 50 a day, a global health expert has said.Britain appears to be heading towards a peak, after which deaths would decline, and ministers' minds would then turn toward an exit strategy.The Government has said modelling is due soon to show new trajectories for the virus, but public health officials say the curve appears to be flattening.Until now, it has been unclear how far numbers would need to dip before lifting restrictions could be considered.But Sung-Il Cho, professor of epidemiology at Seoul National University, has said that when cases drop below 50 for a fortnight it would be possible to move to ""gradual recovery"".Modelling for The Daily Telegraph suggests that cases in Britain could fall to that level by the beginning of May, which may mean a lifting of some restrictions by the middle of next month. South Korea kept the virus under control via a strict regime of mass testing, contact tracing and localised quarantines, recording just 200 deaths without imposing a national lockdown. Currently, it records 53 new cases daily.At a briefing for science journalists, Prof Cho said: ""One of our aims is maintaining new cases below 50 a day for the next two weeks - to do that, we need to keep on social distancing.""In London, Rishi Sunak, the Chancellor, refused to be drawn on an exit strategy, saying it was important to concentrate on keeping numbers down. Prof Chis Whitty, the Chief Medical Officer, said no exit strategy would be considered until ""we are confident we are beyond the peak"".Although deaths continue to rise in Britain, Prof Stephen Powis, the national medical director for NHS England, was optimistic that the epidemic curve was beginning to flatten.Experts are now beginning to consider the scenarios of how Britain could emerge from lockdown, including intermittent social distancing, with people required to go back into lockdown if the virus resurfaces.Prof David Alexander, of University College London's institute for risk and disaster reduction, said: ""Britain and other countries should hold themselves ready to return to lockdown, possibly with more stringent conditions than before. In the autumn, a second wave of Covid-19 could occur and could be devastating.""Allowing the healthy or immune to resume their lives and get back to work, while continuing to shield the vulnerable, could also be a way to loosen the reins. A third strategy, possibly the most likely, involves waiting until cases are at a very low level, lifting restrictions and combating any remaining disease via aggressive contact tracing, testing and quarantine zones.All scenarios involve waiting until the virus has peaked and death figures have fallen dramatically. But experts warned that life after lockdown was unlikely to get back to normal for a long time, with restrictions likely to be needed for many months.Dr Joe Grove, of UCL's department of infection and immunity, said: ""Once the current epidemic peak has passed, simply returning to life as usual would likely trigger another epidemic.""Ultimately, the only way we can shake off the shackles of Covid-19 is widespread immunity and the only safe way to achieve that is through vaccination. In the meantime, testing gives us a route to some semblance of normality.""Prof Ilan Kelman, also from UCL, said there could be a ""staged standdown"" of restrictions. ""So, arts and sports events would not return immediately, but we could be outside as much as we want. Numbers would have to be controlled on public transport and in stores, with meetings and events continuing online. A final possibility would be the availability of a safe and effective vaccine,"" he said.This week, the University of Warwick suggested that allowing young people aged 20 to 30 out early could help to get Britain moving again.Andrew Oswald, professor of economics and behavioural science at Warwick, said: ""The rationale for lockdown is to save lives. However, severe damage is being done to the economy, future incomes, unemployment rates, levels of national debt and the freedoms we enjoy as a modern society. ""Before long, some balance will have to be struck.""Mixed messages Officials on the time frame for review March 23 Boris Johnson: ""I can assure you that we will keep these restrictions under constant review. We will look again in three weeks."" March 25 Prof Chris Whitty: ""The fantastic work by the NHS to increase supply; that is the way we will narrow this gap to the smallest possible gap over the next three weeks."" March 29 Dr Jenny Harries: ""I don't think I have said we will be in lockdown for six months. I also haven't said we'll definitely be in the best place possible in two or three weeks."" March 30 Sir Patrick Vallance: ""I think it's premature to put an absolute time on how long this goes on for.""

321,The Times view on how to exit the UK lockdown: Which Way Out?;A successful exit strategy will depend on public support. The government should publish its plans and let parliament debate them,"April 9, 2020 Thursday",International,thetimes.co.uk,658,658,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,,The Times view on how to exit the UK lockdown: Which Way Out?A successful exit strategy will depend on public support. The government should publish its plans and let parliament debate them,"The government said that it would review the lockdown restrictions to tackle the coronavirus pandemic after three weeks. There is of course no prospect of any restrictions being lifted for some weeks yet. Not when deaths from Covid-19 rose by another 881 yesterday, taking the total to 7,978, while the number of those confirmed as infected rose by 4,344 to 65,077. There have been some tentative signs from Italy and Spain, the two European countries hardest hit, that after a month of lockdowns the daily toll of deaths has peaked and the curve of new infections has flattened. Britain is not at that point yet, so the restrictions must remain in place. Polls suggest the overwhelming majority of people accept that.Nonetheless that does not mean it is too soon to start planning an exit strategy. In fact it is vital that the government does so if public confidence is to be sustained as the costs of the lockdown become clear. Those costs are measured in terms of jobs and livelihoods destroyed, the eye-watering rise in public debt, the damage to the prospects of younger generations and the wider toll on physical and mental health arising from operations cancelled and treatments forgone. All these costs need to be carefully weighed in deciding when and how to ease the restrictions. There are no right answers, only difficult trade-offs.The government's first task is to define its objective. Is the goal to suppress all transmission of the virus so that people can resume normal life without fear of infection? This appears to be the approach taken by China and many Asian countries. True also in New Zealand, where restrictions are only being lifted as deaths and new infections dip towards zero. Such an exit strategy would rely on mass testing, contact tracing and isolation of fresh infections as well as strict border controls. Or is the goal simply to ensure that the pandemic does not overwhelm the NHS? That would mark a return to the ""herd immunity"" strategy that the government was pursuing until its abrupt U-turn in mid-March. This approach would at the least require a substantial increase in NHS capacity but would allow for an earlier lifting of restrictions.Even when the government is clear on what it is trying to achieve, it will face hard choices. Should it go for a phased approach like Austria, which is lifting restrictions on retailers first? Or should it lift restrictions first for younger people not living with their parents, who are least at risk from dying from the disease but have most to lose from long lockdowns, as a paper by economists at Warwick University has suggested? Should restrictions be lifted sooner in parts of the country that appear to be free of the disease? Should older people and those with underlying conditions be required to continue to self-isolate? Should schools reopen early, as a paper from University College London suggests? Or should they remain closed, as China and Italy have concluded? When should bars and restaurants reopen? When will public gatherings including sports events and theatre performances be allowed? Can technology be used to enforce partial lockdowns and trace contacts as in some Asian countries? Is there a role for immunity certificates if an antibody test is found?These are not questions to be delegated to scientists. They are political judgments that need to be informed by insights drawn from a range of disciplines including medicine, economics and behavioural science. Nor are they questions that should be taken behind closed doors. Any successful exit needs to have the support of the public. The government has already learnt through its bungled handling of the early stages of this crisis the costs of failing to be transparent. Sir Keir Starmer, the Labour leader, has rightly called for ministers to publish their exit strategy. The government should do so and parliament must be allowed to debate it. Britain cannot afford to get this wrong.",Newspaper; Web Publication
322,"How long will the UK coronavirus lockdown last?;Less than 12 hours after the Prime Minister's historic address to the nation, the London Underground was still jammed with commuters","April 9, 2020 Thursday",International,telegraph.co.uk,1340,1340,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,"By Sarah Knapton, Science Editor","How long will the UK coronavirus lockdown last?Less than 12 hours after the Prime Minister's historic address to the nation, the London Underground was still jammed with commuters","Boris Johnson took the unprecedented step of curtailing individual freedoms to prevent the further spread of            coronavirus.The Prime Minister said that measures would be in place for three weeks-until April 13-and then reviewed. But given the expected trajectory of the disease, and the decisions taken by other countries who are ahead of Britain in terms of virus progression, it is            unlikely the restrictions will be lifted then.On Thursday evening, Dominic Raab, deputising for Boris Johnson, said that the lockdown measures will ""have to stay in place until we've got the evidence that clearly shows we've moved beyond the peak"" when asked whether the Government had decided to extend the rules.Mr Raab also said: ""SAGE will meet next week to discuss the latest evidence and we'll keep the measures we put in place under review.""For a start, compared to most countries, the UK had a porous and half-hearted beginning to its isolation measures, with seemingly few people choosing to stay inside. •How long do lockdowns last? Countries which acted fastest could be freed firstLess than 12 hours after the Prime Minister's historic address to the nation on March 23, the London Underground was jammed with commuters (see video below), while builders were seen eating together in communal canteens, making a mockery of the Government's rule that no more than two people can gather together in public.Professor Susan Michie, Director of the University College London's Centre for Behaviour Change, warned that some people would simply not be able to carry out the measures, even if they wanted to.""Five million self-employed people are being left potentially destitute by the Government failing to offer financial supportas they have done for directly employed workers,"" she said. ""Since [statutory sick pay of] £94 is not enough to pay rent, bills, food for a family etc, they will be forced to carry on as usual.""           Business experts have also called for young people, aged between 20 and 30, to be allowed out of lockdown early saying it could help get Britain moving again and avoid an ""extraordinary recession"".The British Transport Police is now on hand to make sure only            critical workers are using the London Underground. But such an inauspicious start to the lockdown suggests the virus will spread further than it would have, had stricter measures been implemented earlier,            as they have in other countries. And it means that the measures we do have are likely to be in place for longer to ""flatten the curve"" in a way that would prevent a second dangerous peak.In addition, on April 1 the Government revealed figures that suggested the lockdown was starting to fray as data showed an ""uptick""            in the number of people using transport.The number of those using their cars and public transport, which had been consistently dropping since strict social distancing measures were introduced, rose for the first time.It is feared that sunny weather will prompt more people to break the rules and go outside and socialise as the Easter holidays begin.Mervyn King, the former Governor of the Bank of England, warned that there could be a ""rebellion"" if the measures are enforced for too long. Meanwhile, the            lockdown in Wuhanfinally ended on April 8, a huge milestone for the country and a signal that the crisis-for them at least-is nearing its end. The city in Hubei province was the epicentre of the coronavirus outbreak.Yet it took more than two months of extremely draconian restrictions, including travel bans and quarantine zones, to achieve the level of containment seen in Wuhan. Britain is nowhere near that level of lockdown.And the Chinese restrictions were not lifted for more than 12 weeks after the first death, so if Britain follows a similar path, ours may need to be in place until the end of May/early June. Certainly, that is when the Government has said it expects cases to peak and then level out.However, from papers released recently, we know the Government is at least considering restricting movement for the rest of the year.The Scientific Pandemic Influenza Group on Modelling, which feeds into the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), proposed that because of the length of the outbreak, parts of the country could be placed in six-month lockdowns at a time, before being allowed more freedom. Professor Rowland Kao, the Sir Timothy O'Shea Professor of Veterinary Epidemiology and Data Science at the University of Edinburgh, said: ""It must be hoped that such measures will only last a relatively short time.""However, we must be prepared for this not to be the case, and for them to be in place for an extended period.""The next weeks until the Prime Minister's review will be crucial, as the unfolding epidemic will now be seen in real time, rather than through modelling, allowing experts to make more accurate predictions of when it will peak, and finally die away. It is also possible that after three weeks it becomes apparent that the costs to shutting down society far outweigh the benefit of slowing the spread and the government may choose to lift restrictions even before the peak.•Listen to the daily podcastProfessor Mark Woolhouse, Professor of Infectious Disease Epidemiology, University of Edinburgh, said: ""We now enter a phase of careful monitoring. We are looking for indicators first that the epidemic is slowing down and then for numbers of new cases to start to fall. ""After three weeks we will have to decide whether the restrictions need to be continued, can be relaxed, or can be relaxed temporarily with the expectation of imposing them again later. ""We must also monitor the damage that the lockdown is doing; damage to the economy, to education, to psychological well-being and to health and social care provision in the community. The impacts of this epidemic are too far reaching for policy decisions to be driven by epidemiology alone.""Professor Sheila Bird said that more cases in coming weeks would make it easier for the Government to predict how the epidemic is responding to lockdown measures, which will inform how long they remain in place. ""Once an epidemic takes hold, as now in UK, the country's own data - properly reported and interpreted - take precedence over modelling as the data tell us the actual toll which the epidemic is exacting,"" she said.""A huge amount can be inferred about the immediately forthcoming weeks from these data directly, including whether further policy changes are needed to reinforce social-distancing; for example in particular age groups.""Some experts are still concerned that the current restrictions do not go far enough while others say the government has been hit by an ""epidemic of action"", and is now bringing in measures that have little rationale. Professor Robert Dingwall, Professor of Sociology, at Nottingham Trent University, wrote in The Telegraph: ""It is another triumph of populism over science, of a capitulation to the demand to 'do something'. ""We are still seeing some notion that 'the people' are selfish and must be bullied and disciplined. ""The people are not selfish; they have behaved in ways that are individually rational but have collectively irrational results.""However Dr Andrea Collins, Senior Clinical Lecturer in Respiratory Medicine at the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine (LSTM), said: ""I believe that they have not quite gone far enough. The 'absolutely' necessary to go to work is still being used by some when it is not required-I think we need permits across controlled areas to go to a workplace.""Recent modelling from the universities of Exeter, Bristol and Warwick suggested that without any measures at all, the epidemic would have peaked around 133 days after first person-to-person transmission in Britain, which happened around February 28. So the lockdown has the potential of curtailing the spread by around seven weeks. A welcome relief for people who could have been facing lockdown for most of the summer.",Newspaper; Web Publication

That's what is happening right now,"" Professor Ferguson told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.""We clearly don't want these measures to continue any longer than is absolutely necessary. The economic cost, social cost, personal and health costs are huge. But we do want to find a set of policies which maintains suppression of transmission of this virus.""Without doubt, measures will be targeted probably by age, by geography and we will need to introduce in my view - this is not government policy - much larger levels of testing at the community level to really isolate cases more effectively and identify transmissions. ""The scientist, who is a member of the government's Sage advisory committee, added: ""Both in the scientific community ... and in government itself it's the number one topic and priority every waking minute as it were.""Geographically, London is thought to be the epicentre of the outbreak in the UK.Professor Paul Cosford, emeritus medical director for Public Health England (PHE), suggested that schools could be one of the first places to reopen. There is academic debate about whether closing schools is necessary, as children's lower susceptibility to the virus may mean they are also less contagious. ""We do know that children are at very low risk of getting complications from this disease. The importance of children's education, children being in school, is paramount,"" Professor Cosford said.Schools could be among the first places to reopen (Reuters)""I could conceive of circumstances in which some of the restrictions are lifted sooner and some are lifted later.""Andrew Oswald, professor of economics and behavioural science at the University of Warwick, was one of the authors of the report suggesting young people should have their restrictions lifted first.""The rationale for lockdown is to save lives in the short to medium term,"" he said. ""However, severe damage is being done to the economy, future incomes, unemployment rates, levels of national debt, and the freedoms we enjoy as a modern society. Before long, some balance will have to be struck.""Like children, younger people are less susceptible to developing severe symptoms when they catch the virus - though the researchers estimated that their proposed strategy would result in between 600 and 700 extra deaths. There are currently around 900 officially reported deaths a day in hospitals in the UK.Nick Powdthavee, professor of behavioural economics at Warwick Business School, said: ""We support the existing lockdown strategy, but in the future it will be necessary to allow citizens to go back to some kind of normal life.""Unless a vaccine is suddenly discovered there are no risk-free or painless ways forward.""If this policy were enacted, there would still be tragic cases and some pressure on the NHS, but the effects would be far smaller than if the wider population were released.""Asked about the comments that the lockdown could be relaxed by age and geographical area, a Downing Street spokesperson said: ""He [Professor Ferguson] is a member of Sage as you know.

324,Coronavirus: Expert warns lockdown is causing additional deaths,"April 10, 2020 Friday",International,thetimes.co.uk,806,806,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,Mark McLaughlin,Coronavirus: Expert warns lockdown is causing additional deaths,"A public health expert has called on the Scottish government to give the public a clearer understanding of the lockdown exit strategy as fears grow that deaths are rising among people who do not have coronavirus.Linda Bauld, a behavioural scientist at Edinburgh University, said that people with potentially fatal illnesses were avoiding their GPs after advice that the health service was becoming overwhelmed. Others have been drinking themselves to death sitting at home, she said.The number of deaths in Scotland last week was 60 per cent above the five-year average for the first week of April but only about a third of the excess was attributed to Covid-19.Nicola Sturgeon said that ""some but not all"" of the deaths would be down to late registration and undiagnosed coronavirus infection, but did not rule out the possibility that people had been dying of other avoidable illnesses.She said it was too early to speculate on an exit strategy, but Professor Bauld warned that people were losing hope as the prospect of liberty receded.Professor Bauld said her colleagues at the university's Usher Institute who sat on the Scottish government's Covid-19 advisory group were ""hearing conflicting evidence and advice"" about exit strategies and that it was time for the government to open up.""What is the plan?"" she said. ""That debate has been happening in Denmark, in Austria, and in Germany they have had a very useful think tank paper that sets out a number of scenarios.""I don't hear the Scottish government or the UK government talking about what the measures would be. Is it gradual release, allowing certain businesses to start up again, a phased return to education with half a class? What treatments might be available, other measures? We need to hear some options from government soon. The main reason, from a behavioural science perspective, that we need to hear those soon is to give the public hope that there is a next stage. I'm not a virologist but I'm a scientist and I am a researcher, and in terms of democracy we need transparency and we need to see that information.""Professor Bauld said she feared that Scotland could already have reached the point at which the lockdown became more deadly than the virus. ""The mortality statistics showed that deaths were up 60 per cent in Scotland from the five-year average, and the first minister said herself that wasn't all down to coronavirus,"" she said.""Most of that is potentially down to three things. People not being willing to access the health service when they have got chest pain that might indicate something serious. I have definitely seen this. That is happening and there are probably people dying as result of that.""Secondly, I am also getting emails from NHS colleagues where they are getting told to keep everybody away from outpatients. Oncologists are working on general medical wards.""There has been a big shift, which is probably wise, to gear up the NHS for probably thousands of additional cases and not do other stuff, and the other stuff that they're not doing leads to some people dying.""The third area, which is my area of expertise, will be alcohol and drug-related deaths. I haven't seen any data on that, but if people are already drinking heavily most of the time, [they will be] drinking more heavily during this period. We have got good data to suggest that will be happening.""Longer term there will be mental health problems, suicides, and I don't know how much of that would have to happen [for the lockdown to be lifted] but if we see more evidence like the instances that we are starting to see people are going to get very concerned.""Ms Sturgeon said it was not clear what was causing the excess deaths and that similar unexplained deaths had happened in other countries.At a briefing in Edinburgh she said: ""Every action has a reaction. Everything you do to try to deal with one thing has consequences elsewhere, and I am acutely mindful of the consequences of the lockdown in a whole range of ways, and that has to be part of our thinking.""The Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies, which will inform the UK's exit strategy, will meet again next week before another meeting of Cobra, the UK government's emergency planning committee, in which Ms Sturgeon participates.Ms Sturgeon said: ""I don't have the data and the evidence and the advice yet that would allow me to say with confidence that we can come out of where we are now, and do X, Y and Z in this particular order and be confident that that wouldn't have disastrous effects in terms of the virus spreading. I hope to be standing here in the not too distant future in a different position . . . but I don't want to allow, on my part, and on the public's part, impatience to get out of this to actually do more damage than good, and do the damage that we are trying to prevent.""",Newspaper; Web Publication

The government said it would not block furloughed employees from taking on additional work during the coronavirus crisis. The move is designed to boost the economy and help badly hit sectors such as care providers and farmers, who face difficulty with the coming harvest. Universal credit applications in the UK surged to ten times their normal level in the two weeks leading up to April 1, but millions of people are also about to be furloughed, with their jobs placed on hold and 80 per cent of their salaries being paid under a government scheme.",Newspaper

But we need those 4.2 million people to return to work, forming a mini-economy run by and for the young","April 10, 2020 Friday",International,The Independent (United Kingdom),393,393,England & Wales,Nick Powdthavee,"I've advised the government to release people in their twenties from lockdown. This is whyOf course, some lives will tragically be lost. But we need those 4.2 million people to return to work, forming a mini-economy run by and for the young","The decision to lock down the UK to slow the spread of Covid-19 was undoubtedly the right one to save lives in the short term. However, this strategy carries an enormous cost.                     Rishi Sunak's Job Retention Scheme to pay the wages of furloughed staff for three months could now cost up to £40bn - and that is just the tip of the iceberg.The UK lockdown is causing severe damage to unemployment rates, future salaries and levels of national debt. The UK is hurtling towards an extraordinary recession that will potentially cost many lives. Unless a vaccine is discovered quickly, there is no pain-free way forward. Sooner, rather than later, we need an exit strategy that balances epidemiology and the economy to minimise all the risks.One approach would be a staggered release, starting with 20-to 30-year-olds.                     Such a strategy is not without risk, of course. There would still be those who tragically lose their lives as a result. The estimated fatality rate for coronavirus patients aged 20-29 is 0.03 per cent, while twice that number need critical care. Based on those figures, lifting the lockdown on young adults might result in an additional 630 premature deaths and create significant pressure on the NHS. However, the effects would be far smaller than releasing the wider population.Another challenge would be enforcing the new restrictions to ensure only those aged under 30 left their home amid likely resentment from other age groups. The police would need powers to stop and fine older adults who breached the lockdown. However, such draconian measures are already in place in the UK and many other countries.Politicians would have to explain to the rest of the population the logic behind releasing young adults first, offering them hope that this staggered approach would help them regain their own freedom. This could be accelerated by antibody testing to identify those who have developed an immunity to the disease and are safe to be released.In this way UK society and the economy might begin to move forward in the footsteps of the young, setting an example for other countries to follow.

332,"How long will the UK coronavirus lockdown last?;Less than 12 hours after the Prime Minister's historic address to the nation, the London Underground was still jammed with commuters","April 10, 2020 Friday",International,telegraph.co.uk,1410,1410,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,"By Sarah Knapton, Science Editor","How long will the UK coronavirus lockdown last?Less than 12 hours after the Prime Minister's historic address to the nation, the London Underground was still jammed with commuters","On 23 March, Boris Johnson took the unprecedented step of curtailing individual freedoms to prevent the further spread of            coronavirus.At the time, The Prime Minister said that measures would be in place for three weeks-until April 13-and then reviewed. On Thursday 9 April, Dominic Raab, deputising for Boris Johnson, said that the lockdown measures will ""have to stay in place until we've got the evidence that clearly shows we've moved beyond the peak"" when asked whether the Government had decided to extend the rules.Mr Raab also said: ""SAGE will meet next week to discuss the latest evidence and we'll keep the measures we put in place under review.""Speaking at Downing Street, Mr Raab told the public ""we must keep going"" with the lockdown.He said: ""It's been almost three weeks and we're starting to see the impact of the sacrifices we've all made. But the deaths are still rising and we haven't yet reached the peak of the virus. So it's still too early to lift the measures that we put in place.""Given the expected trajectory of the disease, and the decisions taken by other countries who are ahead of Britain in terms of virus progression, it is            unlikely the restrictions will be lifted any time soon.For a start, compared to most countries, the UK had a porous and half-hearted beginning to its isolation measures, with seemingly few people choosing to stay inside. •How long do lockdowns last? Countries which acted fastest could be freed firstLess than 12 hours after the Prime Minister's historic address to the nation on March 23, the London Underground was jammed with commuters (see video below), while builders were seen eating together in communal canteens, making a mockery of the Government's rule that no more than two people can gather together in public.Professor Susan Michie, Director of the University College London's Centre for Behaviour Change, warned that some people would simply not be able to carry out the measures, even if they wanted to.""Five million self-employed people are being left potentially destitute by the Government failing to offer financial supportas they have done for directly employed workers,"" she said. ""Since [statutory sick pay of] £94 is not enough to pay rent, bills, food for a family etc, they will be forced to carry on as usual.""           Business experts have also called for young people, aged between 20 and 30, to be allowed out of lockdown early saying it could help get Britain moving again and avoid an ""extraordinary recession"".The British Transport Police is now on hand to make sure only            critical workers are using the London Underground. But such an inauspicious start to the lockdown suggests the virus will spread further than it would have, had stricter measures been implemented earlier,            as they have in other countries. And it means that the measures we do have are likely to be in place for longer to ""flatten the curve"" in a way that would prevent a second dangerous peak.In addition, on April 1 the Government revealed figures that suggested the lockdown was starting to fray as data showed an ""uptick""            in the number of people using transport.The number of those using their cars and public transport, which had been consistently dropping since strict social distancing measures were introduced, rose for the first time.It is feared that sunny weather will prompt more people to break the rules and go outside and socialise as the Easter holidays begin.Mervyn King, the former Governor of the Bank of England, warned that there could be a ""rebellion"" if the measures are enforced for too long. Meanwhile, the            lockdown in Wuhanfinally ended on April 8, a huge milestone for the country and a signal that the crisis-for them at least-is nearing its end. The city in Hubei province was the epicentre of the coronavirus outbreak.Yet it took more than two months of extremely draconian restrictions, including travel bans and quarantine zones, to achieve the level of containment seen in Wuhan. Britain is nowhere near that level of lockdown.And the Chinese restrictions were not lifted for more than 12 weeks after the first death, so if Britain follows a similar path, ours may need to be in place until the end of May/early June. Certainly, that is when the Government has said it expects cases to peak and then level out.However, from papers released recently, we know the Government is at least considering restricting movement for the rest of the year.The Scientific Pandemic Influenza Group on Modelling, which feeds into the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), proposed that because of the length of the outbreak, parts of the country could be placed in six-month lockdowns at a time, before being allowed more freedom. Professor Rowland Kao, the Sir Timothy O'Shea Professor of Veterinary Epidemiology and Data Science at the University of Edinburgh, said: ""It must be hoped that such measures will only last a relatively short time.""However, we must be prepared for this not to be the case, and for them to be in place for an extended period.""The next weeks until the Prime Minister's review will be crucial, as the unfolding epidemic will now be seen in real time, rather than through modelling, allowing experts to make more accurate predictions of when it will peak, and finally die away. It is also possible that after three weeks it becomes apparent that the costs to shutting down society far outweigh the benefit of slowing the spread and the government may choose to lift restrictions even before the peak.•Listen to the daily podcastWhen the lockdown was first announced, Professor Mark Woolhouse, Professor of Infectious Disease Epidemiology, University of Edinburgh, said: ""We now enter a phase of careful monitoring. We are looking for indicators first that the epidemic is slowing down and then for numbers of new cases to start to fall. ""After three weeks we will have to decide whether the restrictions need to be continued, can be relaxed, or can be relaxed temporarily with the expectation of imposing them again later. ""We must also monitor the damage that the lockdown is doing; damage to the economy, to education, to psychological well-being and to health and social care provision in the community. The impacts of this epidemic are too far reaching for policy decisions to be driven by epidemiology alone.""Professor Sheila Bird said that more cases in coming weeks would make it easier for the Government to predict how the epidemic is responding to lockdown measures, which will inform how long they remain in place. ""Once an epidemic takes hold, as now in UK, the country's own data - properly reported and interpreted - take precedence over modelling as the data tell us the actual toll which the epidemic is exacting,"" she said.""A huge amount can be inferred about the immediately forthcoming weeks from these data directly, including whether further policy changes are needed to reinforce social-distancing; for example in particular age groups.""Some experts are still concerned that the current restrictions do not go far enough while others say the government has been hit by an ""epidemic of action"", and is now bringing in measures that have little rationale. Professor Robert Dingwall, Professor of Sociology, at Nottingham Trent University, wrote in The Telegraph: ""It is another triumph of populism over science, of a capitulation to the demand to 'do something'. ""We are still seeing some notion that 'the people' are selfish and must be bullied and disciplined. ""The people are not selfish; they have behaved in ways that are individually rational but have collectively irrational results.""However Dr Andrea Collins, Senior Clinical Lecturer in Respiratory Medicine at the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine (LSTM), said: ""I believe that they have not quite gone far enough. The 'absolutely' necessary to go to work is still being used by some when it is not required-I think we need permits across controlled areas to go to a workplace.""Recent modelling from the universities of Exeter, Bristol and Warwick suggested that without any measures at all, the epidemic would have peaked around 133 days after first person-to-person transmission in Britain, which happened around February 28. So the lockdown has the potential of curtailing the spread by around seven weeks. A welcome relief for people who could have been facing lockdown for most of the summer.",Newspaper; Web Publication
333,ESRI research finds 'you will infect others' message most effective in Covid communication,"April 11, 2020 Saturday",International,thetimes.co.uk,496,496,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,Colin Coyle,ESRI research finds 'you will infect others' message most effective in Covid communication,"Think-tank research has found that the most effective tools to encourage social distancing are messages on social media and advertisements that warn the public they could infect vulnerable people with the coronavirus.Behavioural scientists at the Economic and Social Research Institute (ESRI) were commissioned by the Department of Health to conduct the research.They showed 500 people a series of ""psychologically informed"" ads and asked them to record their responses. A control group was shown images of a more neutral government information poster about the coronavirus.The posters that highlighted the possibility of infecting others elicited stronger support for maintaining a social distance. This was despite the fact that participants thought the poster with the neutral information would be more effective.The findings suggest that posters that emphasise the likelihood that someone who has the virus can infect ""an identifiable, vulnerable person, or substantial numbers of other people"" have the most effect.This was the same for people already familiar with social-distancing guidelines and those still unsure whether it was advisable to meet others or visit parents.The ESRI said the study supports evidence from other countries that the best communications strategies are those that ""not only inform people about recommended behaviour, but emphasise the impact of non-compliance on identifiable people and the potential number of infections"".The institute conceded there were limitations to the study as well as with other research being undertaken at high speed during the pandemic. ""Most obviously, we measured intentions and attitudes, not behaviour,"" they said.""We need to keep getting across not just what people should do, but why,"" said Professor Pete Lunn, head of the ESRI behavioural research unit. ""Humans are emotional creatures. The thought that we might be responsible for specific bad outcomes can alter our behaviour more than learning the relevant information and facts.""In the UK, the use of behavioural science to inform government policy led to more than 600 academics signing an open letter ""expressing concern"" last month. Rather than reject the use of behavioural science, the academics called for the government to release the research being used to inform policy. It has been suggested the initial reluctance by Boris Johnson's government to put Britain into lockdown was based on fears of ""behavioural fatigue"" - that while people would initially agree they would begin to rebel in a matter of weeks.Among the behavioural science ""nudges"" already being used around the world are encouraging people to sing Happy Birthday while washing their hands or use elbow greetings instead of handshakes. Behavioural science works on the basis that people don't always act rationally, and that ""nudges"" can be more effective at changing behaviour than diktats from authority.                   @colincoyle                   @colincoyle                 ",Web Publication
334,Lockdown could be lifted first 'by age and geography',"April 11, 2020 Saturday",International,The Independent (United Kingdom),621,621,England & Wales,JON STONE POLICY CORRESPONDENT,Lockdown could be lifted first 'by age and geography',"The UK's coronavirus lockdown restrictions will likely be lifted for certain age groups and areas of the country first, one of the top scientists advising the government has said.Speaking yesterday morning Professor Neil Ferguson of Imperial College London said that ""measures will be targeted probably by age, by geography"".It comes after a new report from behavioural scientists at Warwick University, which said that four million people between the ages of 20 and 30 should have restrictions lifted as the first stage of easing the lockdown.""I think there are lots of ideas worth exploring. That's what is happening right now,"" Prof Ferguson told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.""We clearly don't want these measures to continue any longer than is absolutely necessary. The economic cost, social cost, personal and health costs are huge. But we do want to find a set of policies which maintains suppression of transmission of this virus.""Without doubt, measures will be targeted probably by age, by geography and we will need to introduce in my view - this is not government policy - much larger levels of testing at the community level to really isolate cases more effectively and identify transmissions.""The scientist, who is a member of the Government's Sage advisory committee, added: ""Both in the scientific community ??? and in government itself it's the number one topic and priority every waking minute as it were.""Geographically, London is thought to be the epicentre of the outbreak in the UK.Professor Paul Cosford, emeritus medical director for Public Health England (PHE), suggested that schools could be one of the first places to reopen. There is academic debate about whether closing schools is necessary, as children's lower susceptibility to the virus may mean they are also less contagious.""We do know that children are at very low risk of getting complications from this disease. The importance of children's education, children being in school, is paramount,"" Professor Cosford said.""I could conceive of circumstances in which some of the restrictions are lifted sooner and some are lifted later.""Andrew Oswald, professor of economics and behavioural science at the University of Warwick, was one of the authors of the report suggesting young people should have their restrictions lifted first.""The rationale for lockdown is to save lives in the short to medium term,"" he said.""However, severe damage is being done to the economy, future incomes, unemployment rates, levels of national debt, and the freedoms we enjoy as a modern society. Before long, some balance will have to be struck.""Like children, younger people are less susceptible to developing severe symptoms when they catch the virus - though the researchers estimated that their proposed strategy would result in between 600 and 700 extra deaths. There are currently around 900 officially reported deaths a day in hospitals in the UK.Nick Powdthavee, professor of behavioural economics at Warwick Business School, said: ""We support the existing lockdown strategy, but in the future it will be necessary to allow citizens to go back to some kind of normal life.""Unless a vaccine is suddenly discovered there are no risk-free or painless ways forward.""If this policy were enacted, there would still be tragic cases and some pressure on the NHS, but the effects would be far smaller than if the wider population were released.""Asked about the comments that the lockdown could be relaxed by age and geographical area, a Downing Street spokesperson said: ""He [Professor Ferguson] is a member of Sage as you know. I don't have anything to share with you at this point in time. We will set out the details at what we consider to be the right moment.""",Newspaper
335,Expert warns lockdown is causing additional deaths,"April 11, 2020 Saturday",International,The Times (London),806,806,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,Mark McLaughlin,Expert warns lockdown is causing additional deaths,"A public health expert has called on the Scottish government to give the public a clearer understanding of the lockdown exit strategy as fears grow that deaths are rising among people who do not have coronavirus.Linda Bauld, a behavioural scientist at Edinburgh University, said that people with potentially fatal illnesses were avoiding their GPs after advice that the health service was becoming overwhelmed. Others have been drinking themselves to death sitting at home, she said.The number of deaths in Scotland last week was 60 per cent above the five-year average for the first week of April but only about a third of the excess was attributed to Covid-19.Nicola Sturgeon said that ""some but not all"" of the deaths would be down to late registration and undiagnosed coronavirus infection, but did not rule out the possibility that people had been dying of other avoidable illnesses. She said it was too early to speculate on an exit strategy, but Professor Bauld warned that people were losing hope as the prospect of liberty receded.Professor Bauld said her colleagues at the university's Usher Institute who sat on the Scottish government's Covid-19 advisory group were ""hearing conflicting evidence and advice"" about exit strategies and that it was time for the government to open up.""What is the plan?"" she said. ""That debate has been happening in Denmark, in Austria, and in Germany they have had a very useful think tank paper that sets out a number of scenarios.""I don't hear the Scottish government or the UK government talking about what the measures would be. Is it gradual release, allowing certain businesses to start up again, a phased return to education with half a class? What treatments might be available, other measures? We need to hear some op-tions from government soon. The main reason, from a behavioural science perspective, that we need to hear those soon is to give the public hope that there is a next stage. I'm not a virologist but I'm a scientist and I am a researcher, and in terms of democracy we need transparency and we need to see that information.""Professor Bauld said she feared that Scotland could already have reached the point at which the lockdown became more deadly than the virus. ""The mortality statistics showed that deaths were up 60 per cent in Scotland from the five-year average, and the first minister said herself that wasn't all down to coronavirus,"" she said.""Most of that is potentially down to three things. People not being willing to access the health service when they have got chest pain that might indicate something serious. I have definitely seen this. That is happening and there are probably people dying as result of that.""Secondly, I am also getting emails from NHS colleagues where they are getting told to keep everybody away from outpatients. Oncologists are working on general medical wards.""There has been a big shift, which is probably wise, to gear up the NHS for probably thousands of additional cases and not do other stuff, and the other stuff that they're not doing leads to some people dying.""The third area, which is my area of expertise, will be alcohol and drugrelated deaths. I haven't seen any data on that, but if people are already drinking heavily most of the time, [they will be] drinking more heavily during this period. We have got good data to suggest that will be happening.""Longer term there will be mental health problems, suicides, and I don't know how much of that would have to happen [for the lockdown to be lifted] but if we see more evidence like the instances that we are starting to see people are going to get very concerned.""Ms Sturgeon said it was not clear what was causing the excess deaths and that similar unexplained deaths had happened in other countries.At a briefing in Edinburgh she said: ""Every action has a reaction. Everything you do to try to deal with one thing has consequences elsewhere, and I am acutely mindful of the consequences of the lockdown in a whole range of ways, and that has to be part of our thinking.""The Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies, which will inform the UK's exit strategy, will meet again next week before another meeting of Cobra, the UK government's emergency planning committee, in which Ms Sturgeon participates.Ms Sturgeon said: ""I don't have the data and the evidence and the advice yet that would allow me to say with confidence that we can come out of where we are now, and do X, Y and Z in this particular order and be confident that that wouldn't have disastrous effects in terms of the virus spreading. I hope to be standing here in the not too distant future in a different position ... but I don't want to allow, on my part, and on the public's part, impatience to get out of this to actually do more damage than good, and do the damage that we are trying to prevent.""",Newspaper

Volunteering When the British government asked for 250,000 volunteers to help the National Health Service during the pandemic, three times that number applied.Some argue that a state service shouldn't need volunteers, at least not in normal times.

Their children (generally daughters) can sit in on the calls instead of ferrying parents to and from appointments. • Better hygiene. Coronavirus contrarians always point out that the ordinary flu kills thousands too. That's true. However, it isn't a good argument against lockdowns during far deadlier Covid-19. Rather, it's an argument for reducing flu deaths (and misery, and lost working days) in normal times. We now know how to do it: more handwashing; masks and self-isolation for infectious people whenever possible; and better availability of flu vaccines.• Volunteering. When the British government asked for 250,000 volunteers to help the National Health Service during the pandemic, three times that number applied.Some argue that a state service shouldn't need volunteers, at least not in normal times.

Even if measures to stop the spread of coronavirus are eased in the coming weeks, officials are expecting that without a vaccine some element of social distancing, such as shielding of the vulnerable or working from home, would remain in place for a long time.Nicola Sturgeon is under increasing pressure to disclose her lockdown exit strategy as fears grow that deaths are rising among people who do not have coronavirus. Linda Bauld, a behavioural scientist at Edinburgh University, said a failure to provide transparency on a loosening of the lockdown measures was harming public health. Forty-eight more people have died of Covid-19 related illnesses in Scotland, taking the total to 495.It also emerged that: ? Police in Scotland have issued 500 fines for breaking lockdown as officers prepare to break up Easter weekend parties and public gatherings. ? Glasgow University will contribute to a UK-wide effort to test 200,000 people a day but Britain will still have to end lockdown before the virus has been eliminated, according to a leading Oxford scientist.? A serial sex offender has become the first prisoner to die from the coronavirus in Scotland.? Sir Kenny Dalglish, 69, the former Scotland player and manager, has tested positive for coronavirus. ? Downing Street said that Boris Johnson was walking for the first time since leaving intensive care as he continued to recover from Covid-19.? The number of UK deaths from Covid-19 reached nearly 9,000, with a further 980 reported yesterday, the highest daily total so far.? Matt Hancock, the health secretary, said that there was enough personal protective equipment for NHS staff if doctors used ""no more"" than necessary. More than 742 million pieces had been delivered since the outbreak began. ? More than 19,000 coronavirus tests were carried out on Thursday as Mr Hancock said there was capacity for ""all Continued on page 2, col 5 continued from page 1 Virus vaccine hope key social care staff and NHS staff who need to be tested to get those tests"". ? Downing Street urged police against being ""heavy handed"" during the lockdown over the Easter weekend. ? The worldwide death toll reached 100,000, according to Johns Hopkins University in the United States.Professor Gilbert's team is one of dozens trying to find a vaccine and is the most advanced in Britain. She has been working seven days a week to rush through the development stages.""I think there's a high chance that it will work based on other things that we have done with this type of vaccine,"" she said in an interview. ""I would go for 80 per cent, that's my personal view.""Initial safety trials are due to begin soon, with further studies following around the world to see if the vaccine reduces the risk of catching coronavirus.Lockdown made it harder to test a vaccine when the virus was not spreading, Professor Gilbert said. However, if one of the countries in which it is trialled ""turns out to have a high rate of virus transmission then we will get our efficacy results very quickly"".Asked if the most optimistic scenario for a working vaccine was September, she said: ""Yes and we have to go for that.""

However, this strategy carries an enormous cost.Rishi Sunak's Job Retention Scheme to pay the wages of furloughed staff for three months could now cost up to £40bn - and that is just the tip of the iceberg.The UK lockdown is causing severe damage to unemployment rates, future salaries and levels of national debt. The UK is hurtling towards an extraordinary recession that will potentially cost many lives. Unless a vaccine is discovered quickly, there is no pain-free way forward. Sooner, rather than later, we need an exit strategy that balances epidemiology and the economy to minimise all the risks.One approach would be a staggered release, starting with 20- to 30-year-olds.There would be many advantages to such a strategy. These young adults are, statistically speaking, less likely to suffer severe symptoms as a result of Covid-19, making them the safest among us. At the same time, they are more likely to be the hardest hit by the economic consequences of a prolonged lockdown and face a future paying off the country's enormous debts. Evidence also suggests that they are more likely to grow restless as the lockdown drags on and defy the restrictions, potentially sparking a domino effect that puts many thousands more people at risk.Allowing these young adults to resume their lives, largely unrestricted, raises obvious concerns that they might infect their parents and other more vulnerable members of society. Therefore, only those who do not live with older citizens could be released. Even so, this would allow 4.2 million people to return to work, forming a mini-economy run by, and for, the young.Data we harvested from the Annual Population Survey reveals that approximately 2.6 million of those are employed in the private sector. They would be more likely to lose their jobs if the lockdown continued, but would help to stimulate the economy if allowed to resume work. Given that the average weekly income for workers in this age group is £386.28, preventing half of them losing their jobs would bolster the economy by £13bn a year.There is no reason why only the young should benefit. Many older, more experienced staff could continue to work from the safety of their own homes, providing mentoring and managerial support to their younger colleagues using Zoom, Skype, or Facetime.Such a strategy is not without risk, of course. There would still be those who tragically lose their lives as a result. The estimated fatality rate for coronavirus patients aged 20-29 is 0.03 per cent, while twice that number need critical care. Based on those figures, lifting the lockdown on young adults might result in an additional 630 premature deaths and create significant pressure on the NHS. However, the effects would be far smaller than releasing the wider population.Another challenge would be enforcing the new restrictions to ensure only those aged under 30 left their home amid likely resentment from other age groups. The police would need powers to stop and fine older adults who breached the lockdown. However, such draconian measures are already in place in the UK and many other countries.Politicians would have to explain to the rest of the population the logic behind releasing young adults first, offering them hope that this staggered approach would help them regain their own freedom.

348,"How long will the UK coronavirus lockdown last?;As the UK approaches three weeks of lockdown, Dominic Raab has said it is ""too early"" to start lifting restrictions","April 11, 2020 Saturday",International,telegraph.co.uk,1410,1410,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,"By Sarah Knapton, Science Editor","How long will the UK coronavirus lockdown last?As the UK approaches three weeks of lockdown, Dominic Raab has said it is ""too early"" to start lifting restrictions","On 23 March, Boris Johnson took the unprecedented step of curtailing individual freedoms to prevent the further spread of            coronavirus.At the time, The Prime Minister said that measures would be in place for three weeks-until April 13-and then reviewed. On Thursday 9 April, Dominic Raab, deputising for Boris Johnson, said that the lockdown measures will ""have to stay in place until we've got the evidence that clearly shows we've moved beyond the peak"" when asked whether the Government had decided to extend the rules.Mr Raab also said: ""SAGE will meet next week to discuss the latest evidence and we'll keep the measures we put in place under review.""Speaking at Downing Street, Mr Raab told the public ""we must keep going"" with the lockdown.He said: ""It's been almost three weeks and we're starting to see the impact of the sacrifices we've all made. But the deaths are still rising and we haven't yet reached the peak of the virus. So it's still too early to lift the measures that we put in place.""Given the expected trajectory of the disease, and the decisions taken by other countries who are ahead of Britain in terms of virus progression, it is            unlikely the restrictions will be lifted any time soon.For a start, compared to most countries, the UK had a porous and half-hearted beginning to its isolation measures, with seemingly few people choosing to stay inside. •How long do lockdowns last? Countries which acted fastest could be freed firstLess than 12 hours after the Prime Minister's historic address to the nation on March 23, the London Underground was jammed with commuters (see video below), while builders were seen eating together in communal canteens, making a mockery of the Government's rule that no more than two people can gather together in public.Professor Susan Michie, Director of the University College London's Centre for Behaviour Change, warned that some people would simply not be able to carry out the measures, even if they wanted to.""Five million self-employed people are being left potentially destitute by the Government failing to offer financial supportas they have done for directly employed workers,"" she said. ""Since [statutory sick pay of] £94 is not enough to pay rent, bills, food for a family etc, they will be forced to carry on as usual.""           Business experts have also called for young people, aged between 20 and 30, to be allowed out of lockdown early saying it could help get Britain moving again and avoid an ""extraordinary recession"".The British Transport Police is now on hand to make sure only            critical workers are using the London Underground. But such an inauspicious start to the lockdown suggests the virus will spread further than it would have, had stricter measures been implemented earlier,            as they have in other countries. And it means that the measures we do have are likely to be in place for longer to ""flatten the curve"" in a way that would prevent a second dangerous peak.In addition, on April 1 the Government revealed figures that suggested the lockdown was starting to fray as data showed an ""uptick""            in the number of people using transport.The number of those using their cars and public transport, which had been consistently dropping since strict social distancing measures were introduced, rose for the first time.It is feared that sunny weather will prompt more people to break the rules and go outside and socialise as the Easter holidays begin.Mervyn King, the former Governor of the Bank of England, warned that there could be a ""rebellion"" if the measures are enforced for too long. Meanwhile, the            lockdown in Wuhanfinally ended on April 8, a huge milestone for the country and a signal that the crisis-for them at least-is nearing its end. The city in Hubei province was the epicentre of the coronavirus outbreak.Yet it took more than two months of extremely draconian restrictions, including travel bans and quarantine zones, to achieve the level of containment seen in Wuhan. Britain is nowhere near that level of lockdown.And the Chinese restrictions were not lifted for more than 12 weeks after the first death, so if Britain follows a similar path, ours may need to be in place until the end of May/early June. Certainly, that is when the Government has said it expects cases to peak and then level out.However, from papers released recently, we know the Government is at least considering restricting movement for the rest of the year.The Scientific Pandemic Influenza Group on Modelling, which feeds into the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), proposed that because of the length of the outbreak, parts of the country could be placed in six-month lockdowns at a time, before being allowed more freedom. Professor Rowland Kao, the Sir Timothy O'Shea Professor of Veterinary Epidemiology and Data Science at the University of Edinburgh, said: ""It must be hoped that such measures will only last a relatively short time.""However, we must be prepared for this not to be the case, and for them to be in place for an extended period.""The next weeks until the Prime Minister's review will be crucial, as the unfolding epidemic will now be seen in real time, rather than through modelling, allowing experts to make more accurate predictions of when it will peak, and finally die away. It is also possible that after three weeks it becomes apparent that the costs to shutting down society far outweigh the benefit of slowing the spread and the government may choose to lift restrictions even before the peak.•Listen to the daily podcastWhen the lockdown was first announced, Professor Mark Woolhouse, Professor of Infectious Disease Epidemiology, University of Edinburgh, said: ""We now enter a phase of careful monitoring. We are looking for indicators first that the epidemic is slowing down and then for numbers of new cases to start to fall. ""After three weeks we will have to decide whether the restrictions need to be continued, can be relaxed, or can be relaxed temporarily with the expectation of imposing them again later.

349,You will infect others' drums message home,"April 12, 2020 Sunday",International,The Sunday Times (London),485,485,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,Colin Coyle,You will infect others' drums message home,"Think-tank research has found that the most effective tools to encourage social distancing are messages on social media and advertisements that warn the public they could infect vulnerable people with the coronavirus.Behavioural scientists at the Economic and Social Research Institute (ESRI) were commissioned by the Department of Health to conduct the research.They showed 500 people a series of ""psychologically informed"" ads and asked them to record their responses. A control group was shown images of a more neutral government information poster about the coronavirus.The posters that highlighted the possibility of infecting others elicited stronger support for maintaining a social distance. This was despite the fact that participants thought the poster with the neutral information would be more effective.The findings suggest that posters that emphasise the likelihood that someone who has the virus can infect ""an identifiable, vulnerable person, or substantial numbers of other people"" have the most effect.This was the same for people already familiar with social-distancing guidelines and those still unsure whether it was advisable to meet others or visit parents.The ESRI said the study supports evidence from other countries that the best communications strategies are those that ""not only inform people about recommended behaviour, but emphasise the impact of noncompliance on identifiable people and the potential number of infections"".The institute conceded there were limitations to the study as well as with other research being undertaken at high speed during the pandemic. ""Most obviously, we measured intentions and attitudes, not behaviour,"" they said.""We need to keep getting across not just what people should do, but why,"" said Professor Pete Lunn, head of the ESRI behavioural research unit. ""Humans are emotional creatures. The thought that we might be responsible for specific bad outcomes can alter our behaviour more than learning the relevant information and facts.""In the UK, the use of behavioural science to inform government policy led to more than 600 academics signing an open letter ""expressing concern"" last month. Rather than reject the use of behavioural science, the academics called for the government to release the research being used to inform policy. It has been suggested the initial reluctance by Boris Johnson's government to put Britain into lockdown was based on fears of ""behavioural fatigue"" - that while people would initially agree they would begin to rebel in a matter of weeks.Among the behavioural science ""nudges"" already being used around the world are encouraging people to sing Happy Birthday while washing their hands or use elbow greetings instead of handshakes. Behavioural science works on the basis that people don't always act rationally, and that ""nudges"" can be more effective at changing behaviour than diktats from authority. @colincoyle",Newspaper
350,Documents contradict UK government stance on Covid-19 'herd immunity';List of possible interventions included simulating impact of allowing majority to be infectedUK government using confidential patient data in coronavirus responseCoronavirus - latest updatesSee all our coronavirus coverage,"April 12, 2020 Sunday",International,The Guardian (London),967,967,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,David Conn and Paul Lewis,Documents contradict UK government stance on Covid-19 'herd immunity'List of possible interventions included simulating impact of allowing majority to be infectedUK government using confidential patient data in coronavirus responseCoronavirus - latest updatesSee all our coronavirus coverage,"The inclusion of ""targeted herd immunity"" as a possible UK government response to the Covid-19 pandemic - in a list of possible interventions considered for analysis by a contractor - appears to contradict strong denials by the health secretary 10 days earlier that it was any part of government policy.Matt Hancock gave that response on 14 March after two senior government officials had said publicly that achieving ""herd immunity"" was a key aim, prompting widespread alarm among medical experts that the British government was planning to allow the majority of the population to become infected.However, a proposed computer simulation of the impact of ""targeted herd immunity"" was contained in a planning document, used by NHSX and a technology contractor to map out the data response to the pandemic, around 23 March.While it does not appear the herd immunity simulation took place, its inclusion in a list of possible interventions raises questions about the government's stance on the policy.Dr William Hanage, a professor of the evolution and epidemiology of infectious disease at Harvard, wrote in the Guardian that such a policy would result in large numbers of people dying and the NHS being overwhelmed. He reflected the general bafflement among many experts, because ""herd immunity"" is typically achieved via widespread vaccination against a disease.There is no vaccine for Covid-19, and ""herd immunity"" without a vaccine assumes that the vast majority of people who recover from the coronavirus will then be immune, which has not yet been conclusively established. Hancock set out the government's position in            an article for the Sunday Telegraph on 14 March, explicitly denying that it was aiming for herd immunity. ""We have a plan, based on the expertise of world-leading scientists. Herd immunity is not a part of it. That is a scientific concept, not a goal or a strategy."" Asked about the ""herd immunity"" concept on Andrew Marr's BBC political programme the following day, Hancock emphasised: ""Herd immunity is not our policy, it's not our goal."" Yet still, by around 23 March, a planning document used by NHSX, the health service's digital planning department, and Faculty, a British artificial intelligence company contracted to aid the response to the Covid-19 outbreak, included ""targeted herd immunity"" as one of several government ""interventions"" whose impact upon the spread of the disease could be examined via computer simulations. In a list headed ""scenarios/interventions"" that could be modelled, the document includes ""intervention analyses"" of policies such as social distancing and schools closures, which the government introduced incrementally from 16 March. Below those the document lists: ""Targeted herd immunity (only isolate most vulnerable parts of population)."" Later in the document, a list of interventions that ""require no new simulation dynamics"" of the computer modellers comprises social distancing, school closures, ""targeted herd immunity (only isolate most vulnerable parts of population)"", household quarantine and ""area quarantine"".Lawyers for Faculty suggested the proposed herd immunity simulation was the result of entirely internal, preliminary discussion and never took place. In a statement, Faculty said it was ""enormously proud"" of the work it was doing for NHSX, saying its ""visualisations and forecasts"" would allow decision-makers to make faster and more informed decisions. ""This work is saving lives."" The first revelation that the government might be looking to create ""herd immunity"" came on 11 March from Dr David Halpern, the chief executive of the governmental behavioural insights team, known as the ""nudge unit"". No physical distancing measures were in place at that time; all schools, workplaces, pubs, restaurants and social events were still open and going ahead, and the government's only advice was that people with Covid-19 symptoms should self-isolate for a week.Halpern suggested to the BBC that the government was pursuing a policy like the one outlined in the NHSX and Faculty planning document seen by the Guardian. ""There's going to be a point, assuming the epidemic flows and grows as it will do, where you want to cocoon, to protect those at-risk groups so they don't catch the disease,"" Halpern said. ""By the time they come out of their cocooning, herd immunity has been achieved in the rest of the population."" On 13 March, the government's chief scientific adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance, defended the           existing approach and said that building up some form of herd immunity, by having potentially 60% of the population (40 million people) contract Covid-19, was one of the ""key things we need to do"". Hancock made his public denials the following day. The Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) began to issue public guidance that said: ""Herd immunity is not part of our action plan but is a natural by-product of an epidemic."" That, however, still suggests that, despite the lockdown measures introduced on 23 March, the government does envisage a large proportion of the population contracting Covid-19, then recovering and having immunity, and for that to prevent the further spread of the virus.Some medical experts maintain that, in the absence of widespread testing of people and tracing those they may have infected, this remains the government's policy : to contemplate most of the population ultimately becoming infected, and eventually achieve herd immunity. The DHSC did not respond to a question about why ""targeted herd immunity"" was listed on an NHSX document as a specific intervention to be modelled for its impact on the Covid-19 pandemic.The Scott Trust, the ultimate owner of the Guardian, is the sole investor in GMG Ventures, which is a minority shareholder in Faculty.

352,"How long will the UK coronavirus lockdown last?;As the UK approaches three weeks of lockdown, Dominic Raab has said it is ""too early"" to start lifting restrictions","April 12, 2020 Sunday",International,telegraph.co.uk,1410,1410,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,"By Sarah Knapton, Science Editor","How long will the UK coronavirus lockdown last?As the UK approaches three weeks of lockdown, Dominic Raab has said it is ""too early"" to start lifting restrictions","On 23 March, Boris Johnson took the unprecedented step of curtailing individual freedoms to prevent the further spread of            coronavirus.At the time, The Prime Minister said that measures would be in place for three weeks-until April 13-and then reviewed. On Thursday 9 April, Dominic Raab, deputising for Boris Johnson, said that the lockdown measures will ""have to stay in place until we've got the evidence that clearly shows we've moved beyond the peak"" when asked whether the Government had decided to extend the rules.Mr Raab also said: ""SAGE will meet next week to discuss the latest evidence and we'll keep the measures we put in place under review.""Speaking at Downing Street, Mr Raab told the public ""we must keep going"" with the lockdown.He said: ""It's been almost three weeks and we're starting to see the impact of the sacrifices we've all made. But the deaths are still rising and we haven't yet reached the peak of the virus. So it's still too early to lift the measures that we put in place.""Given the expected trajectory of the disease, and the decisions taken by other countries who are ahead of Britain in terms of virus progression, it is            unlikely the restrictions will be lifted any time soon.For a start, compared to most countries, the UK had a porous and half-hearted beginning to its isolation measures, with seemingly few people choosing to stay inside. •How long do lockdowns last? Countries which acted fastest could be freed firstLess than 12 hours after the Prime Minister's historic address to the nation on March 23, the London Underground was jammed with commuters (see video below), while builders were seen eating together in communal canteens, making a mockery of the Government's rule that no more than two people can gather together in public.Professor Susan Michie, Director of the University College London's Centre for Behaviour Change, warned that some people would simply not be able to carry out the measures, even if they wanted to.""Five million self-employed people are being left potentially destitute by the Government failing to offer financial supportas they have done for directly employed workers,"" she said. ""Since [statutory sick pay of] £94 is not enough to pay rent, bills, food for a family etc, they will be forced to carry on as usual.""           Business experts have also called for young people, aged between 20 and 30, to be allowed out of lockdown early saying it could help get Britain moving again and avoid an ""extraordinary recession"".The British Transport Police is now on hand to make sure only            critical workers are using the London Underground. But such an inauspicious start to the lockdown suggests the virus will spread further than it would have, had stricter measures been implemented earlier,            as they have in other countries. And it means that the measures we do have are likely to be in place for longer to ""flatten the curve"" in a way that would prevent a second dangerous peak.In addition, on April 1 the Government revealed figures that suggested the lockdown was starting to fray as data showed an ""uptick""            in the number of people using transport.The number of those using their cars and public transport, which had been consistently dropping since strict social distancing measures were introduced, rose for the first time.It is feared that sunny weather will prompt more people to break the rules and go outside and socialise as the Easter holidays begin.Mervyn King, the former Governor of the Bank of England, warned that there could be a ""rebellion"" if the measures are enforced for too long. Meanwhile, the            lockdown in Wuhanfinally ended on April 8, a huge milestone for the country and a signal that the crisis-for them at least-is nearing its end. The city in Hubei province was the epicentre of the coronavirus outbreak.Yet it took more than two months of extremely draconian restrictions, including travel bans and quarantine zones, to achieve the level of containment seen in Wuhan. Britain is nowhere near that level of lockdown.And the Chinese restrictions were not lifted for more than 12 weeks after the first death, so if Britain follows a similar path, ours may need to be in place until the end of May/early June. Certainly, that is when the Government has said it expects cases to peak and then level out.However, from papers released recently, we know the Government is at least considering restricting movement for the rest of the year.The Scientific Pandemic Influenza Group on Modelling, which feeds into the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), proposed that because of the length of the outbreak, parts of the country could be placed in six-month lockdowns at a time, before being allowed more freedom. Professor Rowland Kao, the Sir Timothy O'Shea Professor of Veterinary Epidemiology and Data Science at the University of Edinburgh, said: ""It must be hoped that such measures will only last a relatively short time.""However, we must be prepared for this not to be the case, and for them to be in place for an extended period.""The next weeks until the Prime Minister's review will be crucial, as the unfolding epidemic will now be seen in real time, rather than through modelling, allowing experts to make more accurate predictions of when it will peak, and finally die away. It is also possible that after three weeks it becomes apparent that the costs to shutting down society far outweigh the benefit of slowing the spread and the government may choose to lift restrictions even before the peak.•Listen to the daily podcastWhen the lockdown was first announced, Professor Mark Woolhouse, Professor of Infectious Disease Epidemiology, University of Edinburgh, said: ""We now enter a phase of careful monitoring. We are looking for indicators first that the epidemic is slowing down and then for numbers of new cases to start to fall. ""After three weeks we will have to decide whether the restrictions need to be continued, can be relaxed, or can be relaxed temporarily with the expectation of imposing them again later. ""We must also monitor the damage that the lockdown is doing; damage to the economy, to education, to psychological well-being and to health and social care provision in the community. The impacts of this epidemic are too far reaching for policy decisions to be driven by epidemiology alone.""Professor Sheila Bird said that more cases in coming weeks would make it easier for the Government to predict how the epidemic is responding to lockdown measures, which will inform how long they remain in place.

353,FORGET TRENDY NUDGE' THEORISTS. IT'S THE QUEEN WHO INSTINCTIVELY GRASPS OUR LOCKDOWN MOOD,"April 13, 2020 Monday",International,The Daily Mail and Mail on Sunday (London),1374,1374,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,,FORGET TRENDY NUDGE' THEORISTS. IT'S THE QUEEN WHO INSTINCTIVELY GRASPS OUR LOCKDOWN MOOD,"COLUMNBY DOMINIC LAWSONThis wasn't supposed to happen. The British people have responded to a draconian lockdown the Government-directed measure to stamp out coronavirus infection with good humour and fortitude.Not only that, we have been significantly more observant of the rules than most other nations in similar lockdowns.Saturday's Daily Mail reported a poll conducted by YouGov, in conjunction with Imperial College's Institute of Global Health Innovation, of almost 15,000 adults in the UK and 13 other such countries.It showed that almost two-thirds of Britons (62 per cent) said they had not been within the mandated minimum 6ft of anyone outside their household over the past week. Across the other 13 countries, the average figure was only 46 per cent although Spain and Italy had marginally higher rates of observance.The poll also showed that 88 per cent of Britons had left their house no more than once on the previous day, compared with an average figure of 80 per cent across the 13 other nations in lockdown.DraconianApparently, these figures have amazed the Government, which had not anticipated anything like this level of public acceptance of the measures introduced by the Prime Minister on March 23.According to The Spectator's impeccably well-informed editor, Fraser Nelson: Government modellers didn't expect such obedience … The stay-at-home exhortations were issued with such vigour because it was assumed wrongly that Brits would not really listen.'But why was that the view in government? They had been listening to their team of behavioural psychologists, who had assured Downing Street that research indicated the British people would not put up with the sort of lockdowns which had already been set in place elsewhere.This explains why, on March 9, after Italy ordered a national lockdown, Boris Johnson refused to follow suit, telling the nation: We are doing everything we can …based on the very latest scientific and medical advice.' The Government's Scientific Advisory Group on Emergencies, SAGE, had recommended that day, with no internal dissent recorded, that the Cabinet reject a lockdown.As an epidemiologist involved in these discussions revealed (in a superb investigation by the Reuters news agency): We had milder interventions in place because no one thought it would be acceptable politically to shut the country down. We didn't model it because it didn't seem to be on the agenda.'The switch to more draconian measures has been widely attributed to the paper from Imperial College, published on March 16, suggesting that a quarter of a million Britons would be wiped out by Covid-19 if the Government had stuck to its less interventionist policies, or half a million if there was no social isolation at all.But as Reuters points out: Imperial's prediction of half a million deaths was no different from the report by the Government's own pandemic modelling committee two weeks earlier.' What had changed was that as other nations notably Italy started lockdowns, the public pressure on Downing Street to follow suit became too great to resist.Opinion polls showed sharply waning support for the Government's handling of the crisis support which rocketed upward after it introduced the lockdown, and which still remains high.This might change as April turns to May, and as more and more businesses face imminent bankruptcy. But as things stand, the events of recent weeks come as a devastating rebuke to the so-called nudge theory' of behavioural psychology, which has held a strange fascination for the British Government throughout the past decade.Essentially, it argues that the best way to get the public to take health-based decisions in their own interests is to nudge' them, rather than tell them on the grounds that people are more likely to take the necessary actions if they believe they are doing it voluntarily.David Cameron was very taken with this and, as a result, set up a Behavioural Insight Team' in Downing Street.Its successor in today's Government, known as the Nudge Unit', had advanced the theory of behavioural fatigue' the idea that people eventually get bored of doing one thing and start engaging in another to argue against the viability of an early lockdown. It claimed that if such measures were introduced too soon', then the public would be in full-scale revolt when the virus reached its peak.ImpactYet if a lockdown, with all its undesirable social consequences, is to have a serious impact in reducing mortality from Covid-19, it needs to come sooner rather than later because of the exponential nature of contagion from a highly infectious disease. The public seems to get that.The originator of nudge theory' is the Harvard law school professor Cass Sunstein, whose 2008 book, Nudge: Improving Decisions About Health, Wealth and Happiness, was put by David Cameron on a list of required reading' for his top team.But Professor Sunstein seems to have been caught out by the coronavirus. On February 28, he published a piece entitled The Cognitive Bias That Makes Us Panic About Coronavirus. It argued: As of now, most people in North America and Europe do not need to worry much about the risk of contracting the disease. That's true even for people who are travelling to nations such as Italy that have seen outbreaks of the disease … Many people will take precautionary steps (cancelling vacations, refusing to fly, avoiding whole nations) even if there is no adequate reason to do that.'A month later, Sunstein had turned around 180 degrees. His next article, published on March 26, was entitled, This Time The Numbers Show We Can't Be Too Careful. It concluded: Extensive precautions, not ending soon, are amply justified.' It did not refer to his earlier recommendation that there was no need … for precautionary steps'.To be fair to behavioural psychologists, a number of them thought and said that their colleagues advising the Government had greatly underestimated the ability of the British people to handle a lengthy lockdown.In mid-March, a group of behavioural psychologists wrote an open letter to the UK Government regarding Covid-19'. They declared: Current Government thinking seems to crucially involve the idea of “behavioural fatigue”.If “behavioural fatigue” truly represents a key factor in the Government's decision to delay measures [involving social distancing] we urge the Government to share an adequate evidence base in support of that decision.'AbandonedThat is the point. What, actually, was the experimental evidence for its assessment of the character of the British public in the circumstances of a pandemic?As Dr Caroline Kamau, herself a psychologist at London's Birkbeck College, wrote two days before Downing Street abandoned its non-interventionist approach: You may be wondering whether there is published evidence showing that applying nudge theory to something like coronavirus is empirically accurate.The answer is no. This means that the mathematical modelling is based on assumptions from nudge theory about how people will behave, but the assumptions are unlikely to be accurate.'In other words: rubbish in, rubbish out.Of course, not all Britons are dutifully obeying the new policy of mandatory, rather than voluntary, social isolation. And the police (or at least the chief constable of Northamptonshire) can enrage even the most docile by threatening such absurd measures as checking individual shopping bags to ensure the public are entering supermarkets only to purchase essential items'.If there is a single person who has been instrumental in capturing the British people's mood in this moment, it is not a policeman or a behavioural psychologist. That person is Her Majesty The Queen.In her televised broadcast last week, the monarch declared: I want to thank all of you who are staying at home, thereby helping to protect the vulnerable …I hope in the years to come everyone will be able to take pride in how they responded to this challenge. And those who come after us will say the Britons of this generation were as strong as any. That the attributes of self-discipline, of quiet good-humoured resolve and of fellow feeling still characterise the country.'That is the mightiest nudge of all.© Daily Mail",Papers

We're aware of reports about a lack of personal protective equipment for frontline medics, and that it has contributed to the deaths of NHS staff. I can tell you that I've seen no evidence of this, which does not mean there is no evidence. Some PPE from China has been rejected due to our very stringent checks, because nothing is more important than protecting the NHS and saving lives. I'm sorry if you feel we have not done that. We're sorry if you feel that previous governments capped the wages of NHS staff in an effective pay cut, that in 2016 many of those now running this government ignored a pandemic practice exercise which highlighted some of the problems we're now facing, or that in some way we spent more time forcing junior doctors out on strike than on resolving their concerns. Let me assure you we are doing everything in our power to flatten the curve in the opinion polls, which was diving before lockdown and is now shooting up because the herd is desperate to think the country is being led by those who know what they're doing. The last thing we want is for anyone to remember that Winston Churchill was one of our most popular leaders ever, yet was trounced by the electorate the first chance it got. We're looking at things in the round, because looking at things in detail is much more worrying.We're considering all possibilities, rather than just those ones which would work best.Every option remains on the table in these entirely unprecedented times that nobody could have predicted, apart from all those times that they did. And we're sorry if you feel that using patronising language to minimise your justifiable rage is a means of infantilising you to a bundle of silly emotions, and that allows us to treat you as a herd. Please talk to our nudge unit about how individual you all feel you are. Please allow us to treat you as stupid. Please do not stampede to sit, sensibly and at a healthy distance from others, in the sunshine, because it makes the place look untidy.Please do not remember how this all started. Please remember blame would not be productive at this time, although an apology would do a lot to restore trust in government, end the groupthink, and ensure that past failures of ideologues with no idea how to govern in the best interests of 66million people are not repeated. Please do not use this pandemic to score political points, and listen to our MPs scoring political points by claiming the Opposition is scoring a political point. Please do not assume that, just because we wheel out someone with the mind of a duck to tell you what to do, we're an entitled band of incompetents unable to acknowledge our mistakes, one of which is Priti Patel and 10,612 of which are you.

355,"For us to listen, those giving orders need to share the pain","April 13, 2020",International,i - Independent Print Ltd,478,478,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,Raj Persaud,"For us to listen, those giving orders need to share the pain","Akey psychological turning point in this pandemic is fast approaching: the upcoming review of the lockdown. How much more can the public take of all the sacrifices? The current equation between ""obedience"" and ""authority"", which seems to be driving these tactics behind closed doors in Whitehall, based on a largely discredited theory of behavioural science.This flawed approach strains the relationship between the ruled and our ruling class, possibly to breaking point.The results of the most famous experiment in the history of the behavioural sciences, Yale psychologist Stanley Milgram's notorious obedience to authority experiments, suggest that popular obedience could soon decline dramatically. In Milgram's research the 1960s, members of the public were persuaded by white-coated authority figures to administer seemingly life-threatening electric shocks to strangers.But the subjects remained unaware that the person receiving the shocks was in fact part of the experiment, merely play-acting the effects of electrocution. Some per cent of the public went all the way up to administering such a high voltage that the strangers appeared to have been rendered unconscious, or possibly dead. The astounding power of the ""whitecoated"" authority figure to secure blind obedience was seemingly confirmed by these results.It seems to be no accident, if you have read the Milgram experiments, that our ministers are always flanked by professors and doctors when they give their daily briefings. It seems fair to assume that our government invokes the authority of the ""white coat"" to secure blind obedience, exactly as Milgram's experiment apparently indicated. But this strategy misunderstands the correct takehome lesson of the experiment. A very different interpretation was recently published from the University of Queensland, Australia and the University of St. Andrews in Scotland. Psychologists Alexander Haslam and Stephen Reicher argued that when one looks closely at what actually happened during the Milgram experiment, it was not issuing orders that achieved co-operation.It was instead a subtle yet more powerful psychology: the subjects being persuaded that they were part of a team working to further the cause of the scientific discovery. The subjects bought into the idea that they were sharing a mission with the experimenter, and that was why they ""obeyed"".The compelling evidence is that giving people a direct order is one of the least effective ways to secure their compliance. If public perception is growing that no one in government is enduring the same consequences they are expecting the public to suffer, this will not convince us that we should subscribe to ""sharing"" lockdown.It often feels this ""experiment"" is lurching badly out of control.Dr Raj Persaud is co-author of the forthcoming book 'The Streetwise Guide to Mental Health Care'",Newspaper
356,The 'Dishy Rishi' outpouring shows unconscious bias,"April 13, 2020",International,i - Independent Print Ltd,526,526,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,Poorna Bell,The 'Dishy Rishi' outpouring shows unconscious bias,"Positive noises about the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Rishi Sunak, emerged soon after his first two coronavirus briefings. Observers said that he appeared articulate, coherent and capable. But shortly after Sunak tweeted a picture of himself in a hoodie, at his desk, the conversation on social media switched to how ""hot"" he was.No one has a monopoly on deciding who is hot, but I felt unease when I saw that these tweets were predominantly from white women. That uncomfortable feeling always crops up when I sense that there is unconscious bias at work, but I wondered if I being overly sensitive. Then, however, GQ published what might have been seen as a harmless puff piece, underpinned by the lines: ""Yet while Labour's Keir Starmer is at a first glance far more aesthetically pleasing, Rishi is the man we'd all self-isolate with."" This was followed by Vogue, whose author wrote: ""Swotty Sunak reminds you of the medic you had a crush on in the first term of your first year... the good cop to the bad cop of the boy you inevitably went out with.""At this point, you might have thought that the reason for this outpouring was because he is a Tory Chancellor, and they are not exactly known for being sex objects. Possibly, but some undeniable facts and nuances around race need to be factored in.The first is that Asian men are damned by unconscious bias in the dating world. Along with black women, they do really badly on dating apps. South Asian men are stereotyped as being nerdy, effeminate and desperate for attention. Consider then, the unconscious bias in GQ. Why is Sir Keir Starmer considered to be more aesthetically pleasing? It has little to do with him being a Labour politician; I would argue that it is because he is a white man.Dr Pragya Agarwal, a behavioural scientist and author of the new book Sway: Unravelling Unconscious Bias, explains how bias and stereotypes are the brain's shorthand for what we think is attractive, powerful and authoritative. In Western cultures, a white man is at the top of this pyramid. Sunak (inset) has managed only to circumnavigate the place he is expected to be in - the bookish, beta, brown nerd - because he was thrust into a role of authority via the coronavirus briefings. In non-pandemic times, it is extremely unlikely that he would even be remotely considered by many to be ""Dishy Rishi"".Agarwal writes: ""Media depictions shape identity formation, and the way that Asian men are represented - emasculated with a lack of perceived sexuality - has huge cultural and mental health consequences."" Even positive bias, for instance, drawing parallels with Sunak and a medic, is dodgy because there are stereotypes about Asians being medics. We all have unconscious bias - that is an undeniable, scientific fact. But something Dr Agarwal recommends in terms of recognising your unconscious bias is to ask yourself some questions around it. For me, that would be asking people if they've dated Asian men in the past and how many times have they thought of a prominent Asian man as attractive. Whatever the answers, they will reveal a lot about their own thinking, and that can only be a good thing.",Newspaper
357,"How long will the UK coronavirus lockdown last?;As the UK passes three weeks of lockdown, Dominic Raab has said restrictions will not be lifted until changes can be ""safely"" made","April 13, 2020 Monday",International,telegraph.co.uk,1453,1453,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,"By Sarah Knapton, Science Editor","How long will the UK coronavirus lockdown last?As the UK passes three weeks of lockdown, Dominic Raab has said restrictions will not be lifted until changes can be ""safely"" made","The Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab has said that the government does not expect to end the coronavirus lockdown this week as it reviews the impact so far.On 23 March, Boris Johnson took the unprecedented step of curtailing individual freedoms to prevent the further spread of            COVID-19.At the time, The Prime Minister said that measures would be in place for three weeks-until April 13-and then reviewed.On Monday 13 April Raab, who is currently deputising for Boris Johnson, said that, while there are signs ""we are starting to win this struggle"", the UK has not yet reached the peak of the virus.Mr Raab has said SAGE will meet this week to ""discuss the latest evidence"", and that the measures put in place will be reviewed every three weeks.""We don't expect to make any changes to measures at that point, and we won't until we are confident, as confident as we can be, that changes can be safely made,"" he said.Sir Patrick Vallance, the government chief scientific adviser, said measures would only be lifted ""when we are firmly on the other side"" of the peak, adding that the UK is likely to see a further increase in deaths later this week.""It would be a complete waste of everything everyone has had to do now"" if the lockdown is lifted too soon, he added.Given the expected trajectory of the disease, and the decisions taken by other countries who are ahead of Britain in terms of virus progression, it is            unlikely the restrictions will be lifted any time soon.For a start, compared to most countries, the UK had a porous and half-hearted beginning to its isolation measures, with seemingly few people choosing to stay inside. •How long do lockdowns last? Countries which acted fastest could be freed firstLess than 12 hours after the Prime Minister's historic address to the nation on March 23, the London Underground was jammed with commuters (see video below), while builders were seen eating together in communal canteens, making a mockery of the Government's rule that no more than two people can gather together in public.Professor Susan Michie, Director of the University College London's Centre for Behaviour Change, warned that some people would simply not be able to carry out the measures, even if they wanted to.""Five million self-employed people are being left potentially destitute by the Government failing to offer financial supportas they have done for directly employed workers,"" she said. ""Since [statutory sick pay of] £94 is not enough to pay rent, bills, food for a family etc, they will be forced to carry on as usual.""           Business experts have also called for young people, aged between 20 and 30, to be allowed out of lockdown early saying it could help get Britain moving again and avoid an ""extraordinary recession"".The British Transport Police is now on hand to make sure only            critical workers are using the London Underground. But such an inauspicious start to the lockdown suggests the virus will spread further than it would have, had stricter measures been implemented earlier,            as they have in other countries. And it means that the measures we do have are likely to be in place for longer to ""flatten the curve"" in a way that would prevent a second dangerous peak.In addition, on April 1 the Government revealed figures that suggested the lockdown was starting to fray as data showed an ""uptick""            in the number of people using transport.The number of those using their cars and public transport, which had been consistently dropping since strict social distancing measures were introduced, rose for the first time.It is feared that sunny weather will prompt more people to break the rules and go outside and socialise as the Easter holidays begin.Mervyn King, the former Governor of the Bank of England, warned that there could be a ""rebellion"" if the measures are enforced for too long. Meanwhile, the            lockdown in Wuhanfinally ended on April 8, a huge milestone for the country and a signal that the crisis-for them at least-is nearing its end. The city in Hubei province was the epicentre of the coronavirus outbreak.Yet it took more than two months of extremely draconian restrictions, including travel bans and quarantine zones, to achieve the level of containment seen in Wuhan. Britain is nowhere near that level of lockdown.And the Chinese restrictions were not lifted for more than 12 weeks after the first death, so if Britain follows a similar path, ours may need to be in place until the end of May/early June. Certainly, that is when the Government has said it expects cases to peak and then level out.However, from papers released recently, we know the Government is at least considering restricting movement for the rest of the year.The Scientific Pandemic Influenza Group on Modelling, which feeds into the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), proposed that because of the length of the outbreak, parts of the country could be placed in six-month lockdowns at a time, before being allowed more freedom. Professor Rowland Kao, the Sir Timothy O'Shea Professor of Veterinary Epidemiology and Data Science at the University of Edinburgh, said: ""It must be hoped that such measures will only last a relatively short time.""However, we must be prepared for this not to be the case, and for them to be in place for an extended period.""The next weeks until the Prime Minister's review will be crucial, as the unfolding epidemic will now be seen in real time, rather than through modelling, allowing experts to make more accurate predictions of when it will peak, and finally die away. It is also possible that after three weeks it becomes apparent that the costs to shutting down society far outweigh the benefit of slowing the spread and the government may choose to lift restrictions even before the peak.•Listen to the daily podcastWhen the lockdown was first announced, Professor Mark Woolhouse, Professor of Infectious Disease Epidemiology, University of Edinburgh, said: ""We now enter a phase of careful monitoring. We are looking for indicators first that the epidemic is slowing down and then for numbers of new cases to start to fall. ""After three weeks we will have to decide whether the restrictions need to be continued, can be relaxed, or can be relaxed temporarily with the expectation of imposing them again later. ""We must also monitor the damage that the lockdown is doing; damage to the economy, to education, to psychological well-being and to health and social care provision in the community. The impacts of this epidemic are too far reaching for policy decisions to be driven by epidemiology alone.""Professor Sheila Bird said that more cases in coming weeks would make it easier for the Government to predict how the epidemic is responding to lockdown measures, which will inform how long they remain in place. ""Once an epidemic takes hold, as now in UK, the country's own data - properly reported and interpreted - take precedence over modelling as the data tell us the actual toll which the epidemic is exacting,"" she said.""A huge amount can be inferred about the immediately forthcoming weeks from these data directly, including whether further policy changes are needed to reinforce social-distancing; for example in particular age groups.""Some experts are still concerned that the current restrictions do not go far enough while others say the government has been hit by an ""epidemic of action"", and is now bringing in measures that have little rationale. Professor Robert Dingwall, Professor of Sociology, at Nottingham Trent University, wrote in The Telegraph: ""It is another triumph of populism over science, of a capitulation to the demand to 'do something'. ""We are still seeing some notion that 'the people' are selfish and must be bullied and disciplined. ""The people are not selfish; they have behaved in ways that are individually rational but have collectively irrational results.""However Dr Andrea Collins, Senior Clinical Lecturer in Respiratory Medicine at the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine (LSTM), said: ""I believe that they have not quite gone far enough. The 'absolutely' necessary to go to work is still being used by some when it is not required-I think we need permits across controlled areas to go to a workplace.""Recent modelling from the universities of Exeter, Bristol and Warwick suggested that without any measures at all, the epidemic would have peaked around 133 days after first person-to-person transmission in Britain, which happened around February 28. So the lockdown has the potential of curtailing the spread by around seven weeks. A welcome relief for people who could have been facing lockdown for most of the summer.",Newspaper; Web Publication
358,VIBRATING BAND TO STOP YOU TOUCHING YOUR FACE!,"April 14, 2020 Tuesday",International,The Daily Mail and Mail on Sunday (London),634,634,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,BY FIONA MACRAE,VIBRATING BAND TO STOP YOU TOUCHING YOUR FACE!,"A bracelet that vibrates each time you touch your face could help stem the spread of the coronavirus.Designed by engineers in Seattle in the U.S., the £40 wristband buzzes gently when you go to scratch your nose, rub your eyes or wipe your lips.It is hoped this will not only stop you in your tracks but, over time, will train you to touch your face less.As the coronavirus is able to get into the body through the mucous membranes in the eyes, mouth and nose, public health advice stresses the importance of not touching our faces. The World Health Organisation says: Avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth. Hands touch many surfaces and can pick up viruses. Once contaminated, hands can transfer the virus to your eyes, nose or mouth. From there, the virus can enter your body and make you sick.'Following the advice, however, is not always easy, with studies showing that we touch our faces roughly every two minutes or so.The Behavioural Insights Team, a company part-owned by the Cabinet Office, has said that because most face-touching is done automatically, without us realising, simply telling people not to do it will not work.Instead, in advice issued last month, it suggests removing the temptation by keeping your hands in pockets or folding your arms, and swapping contact lenses for glasses to create a barrier between the hands and eyes.It also suggests asking a friend or colleague to shout the word face' each time they see you reach towards yours. Some of these suggestions may be easier said than done, however, as many require a high level of constant concentration. But the wristband (available online at immutouch.com) now offers an alternative.Roughly the size of a watch, the new Immutouch band contains a sensor that monitors the position of the hand ten times per second.On first getting it, the wearer uses the accompanying app to calibrate it effectively teaching it how their arm moves when they touch different areas of their face. The band then buzzes each time it detects those movements.The aim is to make the user aware of how often they are touching their face and train them out of the  habit, with the app producing charts showing the frequency of the touching, too.Two small studies of similar technology by the University of Michigan in the U.S. have shown the value of such gadgets in preventing another bad habit: trichotillomania, or compulsive hair-pulling. Wearing vibrating bracelets on each hand cut the number of hair pulls and attempted pulls by 90 per cent in one of the studies, and contributed to significant improvements in symptoms' in the other.The manufacturer of the Immutouch is now conducting a study at the Autonomous University of Madrid in Spain.Ten volunteers will be monitored as they wear the bracelet to determine just how much it stops them from touching their faces.Dr Simon Clarke, a virologist at the University of Reading, said the new device could be useful.I am a terrible one for touching my face,' he ???says. Hand-washing is the most important thing, but it is not always feasible when you are out.So something that helps you break the habit of touching your face could help to protect you from the coronavirus.'Sir Cary Cooper, a professor of organisational psychology and health at the University of Manchester, said the device uses conditioning a well-established technique to break bad habits to teach us not to touch our faces.Just as the message that it is socially unacceptable to stand any closer than two metres to others is conditioning us to change our behaviour when out and about, the vibrating alert is conditioning us to change our behaviour regarding touching our face, he says.You may still touch your face a few times. But the likelihood is that you will catch on that you shouldn't do it,' he adds.© Daily Mail",Papers
359,No 10 faces calls to lift secrecy around Covid-19 advisory group;Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies provides PM with evidence about UK response Coronavirus - latest updatesSee all our coronavirus coverage,"April 14, 2020 Tuesday",International,The Guardian (London),984,984,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,Rowena Mason Deputy political editor,No 10 faces calls to lift secrecy around Covid-19 advisory groupScientific Advisory Group for Emergencies provides PM with evidence about UK response Coronavirus - latest updatesSee all our coronavirus coverage,"No 10 is facing growing calls to end the secrecy around the scientific advisory group for emergencies (Sage), which provides the prime minister with evidence about the coronavirus response and how the UK's lockdown is working.The group of scientists, which is meeting this week to review lockdown measures, does not disclose its membership beyond that it is chaired by Sir Patrick Vallance, the chief scientific officer, and attended by Prof Chris Whitty, chief medical officer for England.It published a selection of key papers relating to evidence for the lockdown and physical distancing measures on 26 March - but these are at least a month out of date. No 10 said on Tuesday it was not aware of any plans by Sage to publish more papers or minutes relating to its advice.Boris Johnson's spokesman said there was information about the group on the government's website and its members were ""not hard to find"", as some of them have been interviewed in the media.However, only a handful of those who sit on the group have publicly revealed themselves to be members, including Sir Jeremy Farrar, director of the Wellcome Trust, who said on Sunday that the UK could have the highest coronavirus death rate in Europe.Greg Clark, the Conservative MP and chair of the science and technology committee, is one of those pressing for the full membership list to be made public in the interests of transparency. He said one of the main concerns was that ""the composition of Sage, and the disciplines represented therein, remains largely unknown"".Vallance sent him a letter saying the committee was not prepared to reveal its composition because of security advice from the Centre for the Protection of National Infrastructure and to protect members from ""undue influence"".In the letter, he said: ""Members of Sage and the expert groups come from over 20 different institutions and have the following areas of expertise: molecular evolution, epidemiology, clinical science and practice, modelling emerging infectious diseases, behavioural science, statistics, virology and microbiology.""Other Sage participants include the chief medical officer, Public Health England, medical director for NHS England, the Office for National Statistics, the NHS, the Food Standards Agency, Health and Safety Executive, and chief scientific advisers of government departments relevant to specific meetings or their own scientific expertise.""He said the body had met nine times in February and 10 times in March. But the last minutes published by Sage related to meetings in August 2019 in relation to the breach of a reservoir.Johnson and his ministers have repeatedly said they are listening to the scientists at all points when implementing their response to coronavirus, but experts have questioned why more public health experts do not seem to be involved in Sage and its subcommittees. Most of the reports feeding into the Sage documents published on 26 March were provided by behavioural scientists and pandemic modellers.The strategy on tackling coronavirus also appears to have changed several times, including the abandonment of a presumption of herd immunity in favour of trying to suppress the virus, the admission that mass testing of the population will be necessary to exit the lockdown, and the decision to review advice on the wearing of face masks in public.With pressure mounting on the government to set out an exit strategy on how to ease the lockdown, Jonathan Ashworth, the shadow health secretary, said: ""Ministers must be fully transparent about the modelling and evidential base they are using to maintain public confidence. I urge government to publish any outstanding information and papers that have not yet been released.""Layla Moran, the Liberal Democrat leadership contender, also called for transparency around the membership. ""The composition of Sage and the data on which recommendations are being made must be published, so that we can scrutinise and hold ministers to account on their decisions,"" she said.""The tone and quality of the debate improved dramatically following the publication of the Imperial College modelling, on which decisions were being made. Transparency in decisions is the key to keeping the public onside. I see no reason why this information should be hidden in the way that it has so far.""No 10 denied the set-up lacked transparency. Johnson's spokesman said: ""Sage is obviously a government advisory panel ... We are transparent and you are able to scrutinise the most senior members of Sage about the decisions they reach [through the daily press conferences at which officials appear alongside ministers].""The government is expected to take the decision to extend the lockdown on Thursday, with no relaxation in the measures expected for several weeks. Johnson is continuing to recuperate at Chequers, the prime minister's country residence, after spending a week in hospital with coronavirus and is not currently working, so Dominic Raab, the foreign secretary, is taking the lead on the process.Ahead of that, Keir Starmer, the Labour leader, urged the government to publish its exit strategy from the lockdown this week, as he warns that the ""silent pressures on families and communities across the country cannot be underestimated"".He said: ""The question ... is no longer about whether the lockdown should be extended, but about what the government's position is on how and when it can be eased in due course and on what criteria that decision will be taken.""We agree the measures need to remain in place, but to maintain morale and hope, people need a sense of what comes next. The silent pressures on communities across the country cannot be underestimated."" This article was amended on 16 April 2020.

Foreign Secretary Mr Raab, deputising for Boris Johnson, said the Government's committee of behavioural science advisers would meet today.

362,The great communicator,"April 15, 2020",International,i - Independent Print Ltd,899,899,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,Katy Balls My View,The great communicator,"Before Boris Johnson's admission to hospital, when the Prime Minister was self-isolating in No 10, a Conservative MP argued that the need for Johnson to recover was twofold. First, his own health. Secondly, he was the best chance there was of the lockdown being lifted anytime soon.That wasn't simply because as Prime Minister Johnson is the person tasked with making any such call. It was because lockdown goes against all of Johnson's natural political instincts. While colleagues including Matt Hancock and Michael Gove are clearly in support for the draconian measures of the lockdown continuing, the liberty-loving Prime Minister's discomfort has been clear from the beginning.In the press conferences leading up to full lockdown, Johnson looked uncomfortable when discussing potential lockdown measures such as the use of police to enforce it.With the Government expected this week to green-light another three weeks of lockdown, there's now a third reason Johnson's return to work is seen as crucial to an eventual easing: someone will need to sell it to the public.The biggest surprise about lockdown within government has been the level of public support for it. In the weeks running up to it, Conservative politicians and advisers wondered how in the world you could enforce a lockdown like the one just seen in authoritarian China in a liberal democracy like the UK.There was a focus on the ""Nudge Unit"" (the behavioural insights department set up under David Cameron) and how best to get people to do things without directly asking - on the grounds it would go against the British psyche.But repeatedly, polling has shown that rather than fight the social-distancing measures, Britons are embracing them more obediently than anyone in Government had dared imagine. Before Johnson (inset) officially told pubs and cafés they should close and unveiled the slogan ""stay at home, protect the NHS, save lives"", many were already adhering to these rules.This week a survey of 4,000 people by Kekst CNC found that of the countries surveyed, Britons most strongly prioritise limiting the spread of the disease even if it means costs to the economy - at 74 per cent to 61 per cent in the US - and 54 per cent in Germany and Sweden.A lot of this depends on how you phrase the question. The so-called hawks in Cabinet argue that this is a case of lives versus lives (as there are also health impacts as a result of recession or economic downturn), rather than some straight choice between the economy and public health.Figures released by the OBR yesterday highlight what the cost of lockdown could be. The UK's fiscal watchdog's estimate of the impact of a three-month lockdown followed by a threemonth partial easing projects that the economy could shrink by 35 per cent while the rate of unemployment could rise to 10 per cent.There are ministers who think that simply waiting until the public wants the lockdown to end isn't feasible. A reckoning will come in three weeks and any changes could take some selling.""Lockdown is the easy part - easing it is the hard bit,"" says a senior government figure. ""Behavioural scientists will tell you one thing, epidemiologists another - but in the end it has to be a political decision.""With preliminary discussions under way within departments on what measures could be eased first, we could see more people encouraged to go to work and more types of shops open within a month.All eyes are on the European countries such as Spain which are to begin easing, as they could offer reassurance or the exact opposite.Key to any eventual government messaging is a sense of the cost to general wellbeing of indefinite lockdown, from those needing hospital treatments for other conditions to domestic abuse victims - with the charity Refuge reporting a 700 per cent increase in calls to its helpline. The Health Secretary is currently leading research into the effect on wider health of social distancing.The person best placed to deliver this message to a scared and reluctant public? The Prime Minister. Johnson's absence as a result of his illness has exposed how much this Government relies on him as the chief messenger. ""No one else in the party has anywhere near his cut-through,"" says one member of the Government.While Johnson may be a divisive politician, he is by a clear margin the most well-known Tory politician.It would be near impossible for his deputy, Dominic Raab, to build up such a level of personal recognition in the weeks ahead.This matters because the complicated process of slowly returning to normal life is going to require clear communication. It will also require trust. Trustworthiness was Johnson's biggest perceived weakness in the general election campaign. But a few months later and he finds himself in entirely new circumstances. As someone who has been affected by coronavirus and only just survived the illness, it's difficult to accuse him of not taking the issue seriously.When an eventual decision has to be made on easing the lockdown, ministers don't just need Johnson back to lead the process. They need him front and centre to make the case to the public.Katy Balls is the deputy political editor at 'The Spectator' magazine i@inews.co.uk The public. needs be convinced easing the lockdownis right ANDREW MILLIGAN/Lockdown is the easy part - easing it is the hard bit.

It has fuelled fears that the long term impact of the lockdown, which it is expected will be extended today, could do more harm than covid-19. The Office for Budget Responsibility said this week that the economycould shrink by 35 per cent this spring in the deepest recession for 300 years.Professor Mark Woolhouse, who sits on Scotland's equivalent of Sage but was speaking in an independent capacity, said that if there has been modelling on the economic and societal cost it should be made publicThe professor of infectious disease epidemiology at the University of Edinburgh said: ""I am an epidemiologist and I get the impression that the management of this epidemic is driven too much by epidemiology.""I hope that that is the wrong impression and I hope the Government is taking into account the broader societal costs.""There is a lot of information out there on the epidemiological modelling and there is nothing comparable on the economic, social or psychological side.""We need to pay close attention to these other issues because they are tremendously important and we don't want to get into the position where the cure is worse than the disease.""Ministers have repeatedly said thatthey will be ""led by science"" and have published the evidence upon which they based their decision to announce a lockdown.The document points out that Sage has not covered ""economic considerations"" and none of the sub groups which feed into the panel have an economics focus.In response to a request from the Science and Technology committee, Sir Patrick said that they were not naming the members of Sage, which he chairs, to protect individuals.However he confirmed that the members ""come from over 20 different institutions and have the following areas of expertise: molecular evolution, epidemiology, clinical science and practice, modelling emerging infectious diseases, behavioural science, statistics, virology and microbiology"".Professor Peter Openshaw, vice chair of the New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group, one of the sub-groups which feeds into Sage, said that when he had sat on the panel during a previous pandemic they had not had economists in the room.Professor Openshaw told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""That is really something which is done more at the level of the politicians. So the scientific advisers are advising generally on the medical, the scientific, the virological, the immunological aspects and what is done with that information is very much a political decision. We don't decide, we only advise on the matters that we can advise on.""However, he raised questions over why the identity of the scientists were being kept secret, adding that he ""never felt threatened or intimidated or even particularly controlled by the Government in terms of what we can say"".The Prime Minister's official spokesman said that the group's findings are ""generally published a few weeks after each meeting"".He added: ""We are being transparent and regularly publish research and evidence...every day we are providing the Government advisers for scrutiny via press conferences.""But Graham Stringer, the Labour MP for Blackley and Broughton, who sits on the Science and Technology Select Committee, said it was ""outrageous"" the membership of Sage had not been made public.""The fact they are under pressure is nonsense,"" he said, as he added that it was common practice for scientists when writing papers to declare their interests ""and explain what you are doing"". He said it was ""absolutely"" important economists were on the committee. ""It could be that the poverty caused by unemployment that has already happened and is likely to get worse will have almost as much, if not more long term impact than Covid-19."" A Government spokesman said: ""Decisions are being made based on the best available science, along with consideration of the economic, operational, social and policy implications of any intervention. SAGE' remit is to provide science advice to the Government, but this is just one part of the picture.""SAGE advice is based on the most robust scientific evidence at that time and will consider factors such as the health and social implications of measures that have an effect on the economy. As new data or evidence emerges, SAGE advice changes to reflect the new understanding of the situation.""Of course, economic implications are factored into government discussions, but as the Chancellor made clear, this is not a case of choosing between the economy and public health.""",Newspaper; Web Publication

National Records of Scotland published its second weekly coronavirus bulletin yesterday, which revealed an excess 261 deaths.There have now been 1,515 more deaths under lockdown than in an average April. Only 962 have been attributed to Covid-19.Nicola Sturgeon admitted that she faced a ""horrendously difficult challenge"" in weighing the costs of the lockdown in lives and economic hardship with the inevitable deaths from Covid-19 that will result if she lifts the restrictions. The first minister said yesterday that it would be vital to understand the reasons behind then extra deaths as the lockdown continues for the foreseeable future, with no sign of a vaccine emerging soon.Linda Bauld, a behavioural scientist at Edinburgh University, raised concerns last week that people were dying at home from heart attacks and other treatable conditions because they did not want to bother GPs. Conditions such as diabetes or high blood pressure are also thought to be harder to manage in lockdown.Professor Bauld also voiced fears that people were drinking themselves to death or committing suicide due to stress of the lockdown and a loss of earnings. Sir Harry Burns, who was chief medical officer for Scotland between 2005-2014, suggested that some of the deaths would be due to organ failure brought on by undiagnosed Covid-19 infections.Yesterday Ms Sturgeon said the rising death rate from non-Covid 19 illnesses was ""still being explored"" and was a global phenomenon.Dr Gregor Smith, the interim chief medical officer for Scotland, said: ""I think it is very likely that we will see a variety of contributing factors rather than one single factor that is producing this very clear excess above what we would expect.""In England and Wales last week there were 6,000 deaths above the five-year average, with 3,475 recorded as related to coronavirus.",Newspaper; Web Publication

Worse than World War Two, the global financial crisis of 2008 or any recession.A gargantuan rise in debt and unemployment. A terrifying collapse in tax revenues. A vast Government bailout to save businesses and jobs.It should be a comfort that these same official forecasts also predict a rapid rebound, assuming the lockdown ends and the virus is largely conquered.But even if that startling optimism - which we struggle to share - is borne out, immense and permanent damage will already have been done. Millions of jobs will have been destroyed, thriving firms bankrupted and a monstrous new debt pile amassed, taking years to pay off. The pain of the austerity era after 2009 will have been a mere taster.It is good at least that Britain now knows this. We hope it sinks in. The public must consider it before it rails against any relaxing of the lockdown in case more Covid victims www.die.No one wants more lives lost. But the debate is not lives versus money and jobs. Many will also die from the hardships of poverty, unemployment, tax rises and spending cuts if the economy is kept paralysed much longer.The behavioural scientists advising the Government rightly fear that the public will doubt whether the lockdown's success in protecting the NHS is still worth it if the recession it triggers kills thousands and destroys the health service's funding anyway.We are not there yet. We do not yet know if UK deaths have peaked, though hospital admissions are flattening and the NHS does now look likely to cope.But the crunch point, where a date is set to slowly release Britain from house arrest, cannot wait much longer.",Newspaper
368,"How long will the UK coronavirus lockdown last?;As the UK passes three weeks of lockdown, Dominic Raab has said restrictions will not be lifted until changes can be ""safely"" made","April 15, 2020 Wednesday",International,telegraph.co.uk,1497,1497,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,"By Sarah Knapton, Science Editor","How long will the UK coronavirus lockdown last?As the UK passes three weeks of lockdown, Dominic Raab has said restrictions will not be lifted until changes can be ""safely"" made","The Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab has said that the government does not expect to end the coronavirus lockdownthis week as it reviews the impact so far.On 23 March, Boris Johnson took the unprecedented step of curtailing individual freedoms to prevent the further spread of            COVID-19.At the time, the Prime Minister said that measures would be in place for three weeks-until April 13-and then reviewed.On Monday 13 April Raab, who is currently deputising for Boris Johnson, said that, while there are signs ""we are starting to win this struggle"", the UK has not yet reached the peak of the virus.On April 15, Professor Chris Whitty, the Chief Medical Officer suggested that coronavirus may be about to peak in the UK, as ministers came under fresh pressure to reveal their plan for ending the lockdown.Mr Raab is expected to announce that social restrictions will stay in place for another three weeks.Mr Raab has said SAGE will meet this week to ""discuss the latest evidence"", and that the measures put in place will be reviewed every three weeks.""We don't expect to make any changes to measures at that point, and we won't until we are confident, as confident as we can be, that changes can be safely made,"" he said.Sir Patrick Vallance, the government chief scientific adviser, said measures would only be lifted ""when we are firmly on the other side"" of the peak, adding that the UK is likely to see a further increase in deaths later this week.""It would be a complete waste of everything everyone has had to do now"" if the lockdown is lifted too soon, he added.Given the expected trajectory of the disease, and the decisions taken by other countries who are ahead of Britain in terms of virus progression, it is            unlikely the restrictions will be lifted any time soon.For a start, compared to most countries, the UK had a porous and half-hearted beginning to its isolation measures, with seemingly few people choosing to stay inside. •How other countries are ending lockdownLess than 12 hours after the Prime Minister's historic address to the nation on March 23, the London Underground was jammed with commuters (see video below), while builders were seen eating together in communal canteens, making a mockery of the Government's rule that no more than two people can gather together in public.Professor Susan Michie, Director of the University College London's Centre for Behaviour Change, warned that some people would simply not be able to carry out the measures, even if they wanted to.""Five million self-employed people are being left potentially destitute by the Government failing to offer financial supportas they have done for directly employed workers,"" she said. ""Since [statutory sick pay of] £94 is not enough to pay rent, bills, food for a family etc, they will be forced to carry on as usual.""           Business experts have also called for young people, aged between 20 and 30, to be allowed out of lockdown early saying it could help get Britain moving again and avoid an ""extraordinary recession"".The British Transport Police is now on hand to make sure only            critical workers are using the London Underground. But such an inauspicious start to the lockdown suggests the virus will spread further than it would have, had stricter measures been implemented earlier,            as they have in other countries. And it means that the measures we do have are likely to be in place for longer to ""flatten the curve"" in a way that would prevent a second dangerous peak.In addition, on April 1 the Government revealed figures that suggested the lockdown was starting to fray as data showed an ""uptick""            in the number of people using transport.The number of those using their cars and public transport, which had been consistently dropping since strict social distancing measures were introduced, rose for the first time.It is feared that sunny weather will prompt more people to break the rules and go outside and socialise as the Easter holidays begin.Mervyn King, the former Governor of the Bank of England, warned that there could be a ""rebellion"" if the measures are enforced for too long. Meanwhile, the            lockdown in Wuhanfinally ended on April 8, a huge milestone for the country and a signal that the crisis-for them at least-is nearing its end. The city in Hubei province was the epicentre of the coronavirus outbreak.Yet it took more than two months of extremely draconian restrictions, including travel bans and quarantine zones, to achieve the level of containment seen in Wuhan. Britain is nowhere near that level of lockdown.And the Chinese restrictions were not lifted for more than 12 weeks after the first death, so if Britain follows a similar path, ours may need to be in place until the end of May/early June. Certainly, that is when the Government has said it expects cases to peak and then level out.However, from papers released recently, we know the Government is at least considering restricting movement for the rest of the year.The Scientific Pandemic Influenza Group on Modelling, which feeds into the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), proposed that because of the length of the outbreak, parts of the country could be placed in six-month lockdowns at a time, before being allowed more freedom. Professor Rowland Kao, the Sir Timothy O'Shea Professor of Veterinary Epidemiology and Data Science at the University of Edinburgh, said: ""It must be hoped that such measures will only last a relatively short time.""However, we must be prepared for this not to be the case, and for them to be in place for an extended period.""The next weeks until the Prime Minister's review will be crucial, as the unfolding epidemic will now be seen in real time, rather than through modelling, allowing experts to make more accurate predictions of when it will peak, and finally die away. It is also possible that after three weeks it becomes apparent that the costs to shutting down society far outweigh the benefit of slowing the spread and the government may choose to lift restrictions even before the peak.•Listen to the daily podcastWhen the lockdown was first announced, Professor Mark Woolhouse, Professor of Infectious Disease Epidemiology, University of Edinburgh, said: ""We now enter a phase of careful monitoring. We are looking for indicators first that the epidemic is slowing down and then for numbers of new cases to start to fall. ""After three weeks we will have to decide whether the restrictions need to be continued, can be relaxed, or can be relaxed temporarily with the expectation of imposing them again later. ""We must also monitor the damage that the lockdown is doing; damage to the economy, to education, to psychological well-being and to health and social care provision in the community. The impacts of this epidemic are too far reaching for policy decisions to be driven by epidemiology alone.""Professor Sheila Bird said that more cases in coming weeks would make it easier for the Government to predict how the epidemic is responding to lockdown measures, which will inform how long they remain in place. ""Once an epidemic takes hold, as now in UK, the country's own data - properly reported and interpreted - take precedence over modelling as the data tell us the actual toll which the epidemic is exacting,"" she said.""A huge amount can be inferred about the immediately forthcoming weeks from these data directly, including whether further policy changes are needed to reinforce social-distancing; for example in particular age groups.""Some experts are still concerned that the current restrictions do not go far enough while others say the government has been hit by an ""epidemic of action"", and is now bringing in measures that have little rationale. Professor Robert Dingwall, Professor of Sociology, at Nottingham Trent University, wrote in The Telegraph: ""It is another triumph of populism over science, of a capitulation to the demand to 'do something'. ""We are still seeing some notion that 'the people' are selfish and must be bullied and disciplined. ""The people are not selfish; they have behaved in ways that are individually rational but have collectively irrational results.""However Dr Andrea Collins, Senior Clinical Lecturer in Respiratory Medicine at the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine (LSTM), said: ""I believe that they have not quite gone far enough. The 'absolutely' necessary to go to work is still being used by some when it is not required-I think we need permits across controlled areas to go to a workplace.""Recent modelling from the universities of Exeter, Bristol and Warwick suggested that without any measures at all, the epidemic would have peaked around 133 days after first person-to-person transmission in Britain, which happened around February 28. So the lockdown has the potential of curtailing the spread by around seven weeks. A welcome relief for people who could have been facing lockdown for most of the summer.",Newspaper; Web Publication
369,Modelling the virus;FT BIG READ. CORONAVIRUS ; The British committee of experts Sage was created to keep science and politics separate. But critics say the government pays too much attention to epidemiologists and not enough to other important factors.

CORONAVIRUS ; The British committee of experts Sage was created to keep science and politics separate. But critics say the government pays too much attention to epidemiologists and not enough to other important factors. By Jonathan Ford,"I n the spring of 2001, Britain was wracked by its first large-scale epidemic of foot-and-mouth disease since the late 1960s.The country's livestock farmers were still embroiled in the lockdown that accompanied Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE), a neurological disease of cattle, that would slash beef consumption and exports for a decade.Now they faced the risk of further curbs on animal sales, and the possible mass culling of their herds. Much depended on whether the government got on top of the outbreak fast.Concerned at blithe official statements that the disease was under control, with the implication that aggressive countermeasures would not be needed, one official suggested turning to a novel source to investigate the course of the infection.Sir John Krebs, then chairman of the British Food Standards Agency, encouraged the government's new chief scientific adviser, David King, to recruit epidemiologists at three universities - Imperial College London, Cambridge and Edinburgh - to model the evolution of the disease. It wasn't the first time that computer models had been built to study epidemics. The innovation was to try to do it in real time, in order to guide the response.The independent modellers quickly exploded the government's optimistic assumptions, showing the outbreak was on course to be far larger, and to spread faster, than officials expected. The government ramped up its response, imposing pre-emptive culls inside cordons around infected farmsteads, ultimately slaughtering 6m animals.The extent to which modelling helped remains disputed, with some scientists claiming the intervention led to unnecessary culling. But most studies suggest it led to the outbreak ending earlier, with some scientists claiming that almost 1m fewer animals were slaughtered than if the government's more relaxed stance had run its course.That experience two decades ago has informed the way the government seeks to combat infectious diseases. In the UK one result was the establishment of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), a group of independent scientists and officials presently chaired by chief scientific adviser, Patrick Vallance. Convened periodically to handle specific crises, it has been advising the government on the coronavirus pandemic. Its proponents claim this system has brought rigour to government decisionmaking that was sometimes absent in the past, mainly by separating science from politics.Sir David points to a notorious incident in May 1990 during the BSE crisis, when the agriculture minister, John Gummer, fed his four-year-old daughter a hamburger at the height of concerns over the risk of the disease being transmitted to humans, something that scientists were then still investigating. A report suggesting just such a link was published in 1996.The impression from the photo was that economic priorities trumped health concerns. ""As the official report into the crisis suggested, the minister could seem concerned with other things than science, such as a desire to keep the market up for farmers,"" Sir David says.With the coronavirus outbreak, however, that separation between technical advice and politics has itself become contentious. The government stands accused of being too in thrall to science, in particular to epidemiologists, and of paying insufficient attention to other important factors such as the economy and behavioural science.John Ashton, a regional director at Public Health England, has talked about the government treating its favoured epidemiologists as ""demigods"".Even Mark Woolhouse, professor of infectious disease epidemiology at Edinburgh university, while supportive of the lockdown, worries that insufficient attention has been paid to other considerations. ""I am an epidemiologist and I worry that the response is based too much on epidemiology alone,"" he says.Stark conclusions Much of the concern stems from the weight placed by ministers on a report published on March 16 by a team of epidemiologists at Imperial College, London led by Neil Ferguson. Not only did this document warn that, unchecked, the virus could kill 510,000 people, it counselled that even with the government's then preferred strategy of ""mitigation"", more than 250,000 would die, with the National Health Service rapidly becoming wholly overwhelmed.The stark conclusion did not come from Imperial redrawing its model. It was the result of inputting data emerging from the pandemic in Italy, which showed that far more patients than previously estimated required scarce intensive care beds.Prof Ferguson is a big name in epidemiological modelling, with experience dating back to the foot-and-mouth crisis. The Imperial report sent a shockwave through the system in both the UK and the US, leading to the introduction of the present policy of ""social distancing"" and suppression, with its heavy economic and social costs for the public.Just three days beforehand, Sir Patrick had told the country that the aim was ""to reduce the peak [of infection], not suppress it completely"" and that policy was aimed at building ""some kind of herd immunity"". The impression that a mathematical model prompted a government volte face led to a torrent of critical attention on Prof Ferguson and his team.Some scientists point out that the model was originally built for a different disease - influenza. According to Mike Cates, a Cambridge university mathematics professor, ""everyone's conscious of the fact that it has been rapidly converted from a different purpose and wasn't originally designed for this type of virus and this type of transmission"".He is now leading a project sponsored by the Royal Society - the UK's senior scientific academy - to create more diverse modelling groups.Meanwhile, a rival group of academics at Oxford university released a paper seemingly contradicting the conclusions on likely fatalities drawn by Imperial. This was largely because it assumed the disease had been in circulation longer, and had therefore already infected a larger proportion of the British population without leading to substantial numbers of deaths.Sage advice An ad hoc group, Sage is assembled to meet specific crises. When it comes to infectious diseases, the group sifts data funnelled to it from three subcommittees. One, known as Nervtag, looks at the threat from emerging outbreaks. There is another specialising in modelling called SPI-M, and a behavioural group, or SPI-B. There is overlap between these bodies. For instance, Prof Ferguson sits on Nervtag, SPI-M and Sage itself.One of the concerns about Sage is that it does not disclose its full membership. The explanation given is that it is a shifting cast of experts that moves depending on the task to be tackled. But anonymity makes it hard to know whether its deliberations could be dominated by any one scientific constituency.Sir David worries that there could be a cost in terms of public confidence: ""I simply cannot see the argument for not knowing who the members of Sage are.""Sage members deny it is some sort of modeller's clique. John Edmunds, a professor of infectious modelling at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, who sits on the committee, as well as Nervtag and SPI-M, says it receives contributions from a number of disciplines from virologists to clinicians and behavioural scientists. What seems clear though is that modelling moved up the agenda from late February when the rapid spread of the virus became apparent. That is when this sort of data became the main focus of attention. ""Until that point, we weren't even asked to model the idea of a total lockdown,"" says Prof Edmunds. ""It was only when Italy started to look totally horrific that those sorts of policy options suddenly opened up.""Concerns about the validity of models are not a new feature of public health crises. From their first live deployment in 2001 they have been contentious.Used in 2001 to inform national rules about prophylactic culling in areas deemed at risk of foot-and-mouth, the models infuriated farmers who believed their livestock was healthy. Michael Thrusfield, an expert in animal diseases, later claimed that Prof Ferguson's modelling was ""not fit for purpose"" and led to the unnecessary deaths of animals. While many authorities are more sympathetic to Prof Ferguson, the counterfactual is hard to prove.There was a similar dispute after the 2009 swine flu outbreak when advice based on Imperial's model was made public by ministers. This described a ""reasonable worst-case scenario"" in which there could be 65,000 deaths. In practise, there were only 457.A later official report from Deirdre Hine, a Welsh physician and former chair of the Commission for Health Improvement, cleared everyone of overreacting, despite the consequent expenditure of £1.2bn on flu remedies that were not needed.""When you have a chip pan fire in the kitchen and, because you have a fire blanket and a smoke alarm, damage to the kitchen is minimal and to the rest of the house is non-existent, you don't thereafter throw out your insurance,"" Dame Deirdre said.She did, however, warn about Sage putting too much weight on the ""academic scientific viewpoint - the modelling activity - to the exclusion of views from those involved in operational epidemiology"", such as public health experts and people in the clinical front line. She also urged the government to make sure its response was flexible because future pandemics would not spread evenly but would be concentrated in certain ""hotspots"". This argued against a single response.One scientist who believes the committee discarded Dame Deirdre's advice not to ""model watch"" is Anthony Costello, a public health specialist at University College London. He claims that too little attention was paid to public health measures that could have softened the lockdown.In particular he argues that identification of cases and contact tracing was abandoned too quickly in favour of the blunderbuss of social distancing. Not only has this shut down large parts of the economy, it leaves the UK prone to a recurrence of the disease whenever restrictions are lifted because so few may be immune. ""The lockdown was right in London and other places where it was clearly running out of control, but in other places you could have tried to contain it,"" he says.Even with a shortage of testing equipment, Prof Costello argues that the government could have ramped up ""symptomatic case definition"" - identifying diagnosable cases and tracking who those people had had contact with. King's College London has produced a simple app, Covid Symptom Tracker, which assists with recording diagnoses.He cites some work from Paul Romer, an American economist, who has modelled the relative outcomes of quarantining only those who are tested and isolating a random fraction of the population whether they have the virus or not.This showed that while testing-based isolation locked up between 5 and 10 per cent of the population, random isolation needed to sequester more than 50 per cent to suppress the virus by the same amount. ""An economy can survive with 10 per cent of the population in isolation,"" writes Mr Romer. ""It can't survive when 50 per cent is in isolation.""Prof Costello's conclusion is that Sage may be guilty of discarding testing and tracing too quickly. ""We've been running this epidemic like Robert McNamara, the US defence secretary in the Vietnam war, who collected vast quantities of data to assess the war's progress,"" he says. ""We should have been more like the other side, fighting a guerrilla war against the virus.""Hunt the virus These debates are resurfacing as the government contemplates exit strategies. There is no certainty that an effective vaccine will be available quickly. Other treatments may come sooner, but to end the lockdown in their absence, hard choices will need to be faced.One is to use social distancing to drive the virus to very low levels, and then lift isolation while using testing and contact tracing to play ""hunt the virus"". This is not simple. ""The big questions are how low is low enough, and how long it may take to get there,"" says Prof Woolhouse. ""We are hoping the virus will enter the down phase in the next few weeks, but we don't know how fast that will be.""It also requires a commitment to ramp up testing to levels where such a strategy is feasible. Prof Edmunds questions whether this can be done. ""The data requirements would be enormous,"" he says. ""It would be very hard to operationalise.""The second is to raise NHS capacity rapidly, using the lockdown to create new intensive care units. This could be accompanied by partial lifting of the lockdown, perhaps leaving the elderly and vulnerable in isolation while releasing more of the young to return to work. Once again considerable testing and tracing will be required as many will remain susceptible.Experts agree there will be no return to normal without effective treatment. ""The only real way out is waiting for a vaccine,"" says Prof Woolhouse.The crisis may not be over, but already there are lessons. Perhaps the biggest one, according to Sir David, is to bolster resilience against future outbreaks. As chief scientific adviser between 2000 and 2008, he pushed the idea of the UK becoming more serious about preparing for emerging health and environmental threats.""We seem to have forgotten the lessons, the fact that we need redundancy against all the things we haven't prepared for,"" he says.The current crisis shows how a lack of preparation ultimately limits a country's options. ""When it came to footand-mouth and Sars, we used to be the ones telling China how to respond, but now the boot is on the other foot. The Asians are in the lead and they've responded well. We've done poorly.""'The lockdown was right in London and other places where it was clearly out of control, but in other places you could have tried to contain it' Anthony Costello, UCL'I am an epidemiologist and I worry that the response is based too much on epidemiology alone' Mark Woolhouse, Edinburgh university",Newspaper

It was the result of inputting data emerging from the pandemic in Italy, which showed that far more patients than previously estimated required scarce intensive care beds.Prof Ferguson is a big name in epidemiological modelling, with experience dating back to the foot-and-mouth crisis. The Imperial report sent a shockwave through the system in both the UK and the US, leading to the introduction of the present policy of ""social distancing"" and suppression, with its heavy economic and social costs for the public.Just three days beforehand, Sir Patrick had told the country that the aim was ""to reduce the peak [of infection], not suppress it completely"" and that policy was aimed at building ""some kind of herd immunity"". The impression that a mathematical model prompted a government volte face led to a torrent of critical attention on Prof Ferguson and his team.Some scientists point out that the model was originally built for a different disease - influenza. According to Mike Cates, a Cambridge university mathematics professor, ""everyone's conscious of the fact that it has been rapidly converted from a different purpose and wasn't originally designed for this type of virus and this type of transmission"".He is now leading a project sponsored by the Royal Society - the UK's senior scientific academy - to create more diverse modelling groups.Meanwhile, a rival group of academics at Oxford university released a paper seemingly contradicting the conclusions on likely fatalities drawn by Imperial. This was largely because it assumed the disease had been in circulation longer, and had therefore already infected a larger proportion of the British population without leading to substantial numbers of deaths.Sage advice An ad hoc group, Sage is assembled to meet specific crises. When it comes to infectious diseases, the group sifts data funnelled to it from three subcommittees. One, known as Nervtag, looks at the threat from emerging outbreaks. There is another specialising in modelling called SPI-M, and a behavioural group, or SPI-B. There is overlap between these bodies. For instance, Prof Ferguson sits on Nervtag, SPI-M and Sage itself.One of the concerns about Sage is that it does not disclose its full membership. The explanation given is that it is a shifting cast of experts that moves depending on the task to be tackled. But anonymity makes it hard to know whether its deliberations could be dominated by any one scientific constituency.Sir David worries that there could be a cost in terms of public confidence: ""I simply cannot see the argument for not knowing who the members of Sage are.""Sage members deny it is some sort of modeller's clique. John Edmunds, a professor of infectious modelling at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, who sits on the committee, as well as Nervtag and SPI-M, says it receives contributions from a number of disciplines from virologists to clinicians and behavioural scientists. What seems clear though is that modelling moved up the agenda from late February when the rapid spread of the virus became apparent. That is when this sort of data became the main focus of attention. ""Until that point, we weren't even asked to model the idea of a total lockdown,"" says Prof Edmunds. ""It was only when Italy started to look totally horrific that those sorts of policy options suddenly opened up.""Concerns about the validity of models are not a new feature of public health crises. From their first live deployment in 2001 they have been contentious.Used in 2001 to inform national rules about prophylactic culling in areas deemed at risk of foot-and-mouth, the models infuriated farmers who believed their livestock was healthy. Michael Thrusfield, an expert in animal diseases, later claimed that Prof Ferguson's modelling was ""not fit for purpose"" and led to the unnecessary deaths of animals. While many authorities are more sympathetic to Prof Ferguson, the counterfactual is hard to prove.There was a similar dispute after the 2009 swine flu outbreak when advice based on Imperial's model was made public by ministers. This described a ""reasonable worst-case scenario"" in which there could be 65,000 deaths. In practise, there were only 457.A later official report from Deirdre Hine, a Welsh physician and former chair of the Commission for Health Improvement, cleared everyone of overreacting, despite the consequent expenditure of £1.2bn on flu remedies that were not needed.""When you have a chip pan fire in the kitchen and, because you have a fire blanket and a smoke alarm, damage to the kitchen is minimal and to the rest of the house is non-existent, you don't thereafter throw out your insurance,"" Dame Deirdre said.She did, however, warn about Sage putting too much weight on the ""academic scientific viewpoint - the modelling activity - to the exclusion of views from those involved in operational epidemiology"", such as public health experts and people in the clinical front line. She also urged the government to make sure its response was flexible because future pandemics would not spread evenly but would be concentrated in certain ""hotspots"". This argued against a single response.One scientist who believes the committee discarded Dame Deirdre's advice not to ""model watch"" is Anthony Costello, a public health specialist at University College London. He claims that too little attention was paid to public health measures that could have softened the lockdown.In particular he argues that identification of cases and contact tracing was abandoned too quickly in favour of the blunderbuss of social distancing. Not only has this shut down large parts of the economy, it leaves the UK prone to a recurrence of the disease whenever restrictions are lifted because so few may be immune. ""The lockdown was right in London and other places where it was clearly running out of control, but in other places you could have tried to contain it,"" he says.Even with a shortage of testing equipment, Prof Costello argues that the government could have ramped up ""symptomatic case definition"" - identifying diagnosable cases and tracking who those people had had contact with. King's College London has produced a simple app, Covid Symptom Tracker, which assists with recording diagnoses.He cites some work from Paul Romer, an American economist, who has modelled the relative outcomes of quarantining only those who are tested and isolating a random fraction of the population whether they have the virus or not.This showed that while testing-based isolation locked up between 5 and 10 per cent of the population, random isolation needed to sequester more than 50 per cent to suppress the virus by the same amount. ""An economy can survive with 10 per cent of the population in isolation,"" writes Mr Romer. ""It can't survive when 50 per cent is in isolation.""Prof Costello's conclusion is that Sage may be guilty of discarding testing and tracing too quickly. ""We've been running this epidemic like Robert McNamara, the US defence secretary in the Vietnam war, who collected vast quantities of data to assess the war's progress,"" he says. ""We should have been more like the other side, fighting a guerrilla war against the virus.""Hunt the virus These debates are resurfacing as the government contemplates exit strategies. There is no certainty that an effective vaccine will be available quickly. Other treatments may come sooner, but to end the lockdown in their absence, hard choices will need to be faced.One is to use social distancing to drive the virus to very low levels, and then lift isolation while using testing and contact tracing to play ""hunt the virus"". This is not simple. ""The big questions are how low is low enough, and how long it may take to get there,"" says Prof Woolhouse. ""We are hoping the virus will enter the down phase in the next few weeks, but we don't know how fast that will be.""It also requires a commitment to ramp up testing to levels where such a strategy is feasible. Prof Edmunds questions whether this can be done. ""The data requirements would be enormous,"" he says. ""It would be very hard to operationalise.""The second is to raise NHS capacity rapidly, using the lockdown to create new intensive care units. This could be accompanied by partial lifting of the lockdown, perhaps leaving the elderly and vulnerable in isolation while releasing more of the young to return to work. Once again considerable testing and tracing will be required as many will remain susceptible.Experts agree there will be no return to normal without effective treatment. ""The only real way out is waiting for a vaccine,"" says Prof Woolhouse.The crisis may not be over, but already there are lessons. Perhaps the biggest one, according to Sir David, is to bolster resilience against future outbreaks. As chief scientific adviser between 2000 and 2008, he pushed the idea of the UK becoming more serious about preparing for emerging health and environmental threats.""We seem to have forgotten the lessons, the fact that we need redundancy against all the things we haven't prepared for,"" he says.The current crisis shows how a lack of preparation ultimately limits a country's options.

372,Modelling the virus;The British committee of experts Sage was created to keep science and politics separate. But critics say the government pays too much attention to epidemiologists and not enough to other important factors. By Jonathan Ford,"April 16, 2020 Thursday",International,"Financial Times (London, England)",2411,2411,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,Jonathan Ford,Modelling the virusThe British committee of experts Sage was created to keep science and politics separate. But critics say the government pays too much attention to epidemiologists and not enough to other important factors. By Jonathan Ford,"I n the spring of 2001, Britain was wracked by its first large-scale epidemic of foot-and-mouth disease since the late 1960s.The country's livestock farmers were still embroiled in the lockdown that accompanied Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE), a neurological disease of cattle, that would slash beef consumption and exports for a decade.Now they faced the risk of further curbs on animal sales, and the possible mass culling of their herds. Much depended on whether the government got on top of the outbreak fast.Concerned at blithe official statements that the disease was under control, with the implication that aggressive countermeasures would not be needed, one official suggested turning to a novel source to investigate the course of the infection.Sir John Krebs, then chairman of the British Food Standards Agency, encouraged the government's new chief scientific adviser, David King, to recruit epidemiologists at three universities - Imperial College London, Cambridge and Edinburgh - to model the evolution of the disease. It wasn't the first time that computer models had been built to study epidemics. The innovation was to try to do it in real time, in order to guide the response.The independent modellers quickly exploded the government's optimistic assumptions, showing the outbreak was on course to be far larger, and to spread faster, than officials expected. The government ramped up its response, imposing pre-emptive culls inside cordons around infected farmsteads, ultimately slaughtering 6m animals.The extent to which modelling helped remains disputed, with some scientists claiming the intervention led to unnecessary culling. But most studies suggest it led to the outbreak ending earlier, with some scientists claiming that almost 1m fewer animals were slaughtered than if the government's more relaxed stance had run its course.That experience two decades ago has informed the way the government seeks to combat infectious diseases. In the UK one result was the establishment of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), a group of independent scientists and officials presently chaired by chief scientific adviser, Patrick Vallance. Convened periodically to handle specific crises, it has been advising the government on the coronavirus pandemic. Its proponents claim this system has brought rigour to government decisionmaking that was sometimes absent in the past, mainly by separating science from politics.Sir David points to a notorious incident in May 1990 during the BSE crisis, when the agriculture minister, John Gummer, fed his four-year-old daughter a hamburger at the height of concerns over the risk of the disease being transmitted to humans, something that scientists were then still investigating. A report suggesting just such a link was published in 1996.The impression from the photo was that economic priorities trumped health concerns. ""As the official report into the crisis suggested, the minister could seem concerned with other things than science, such as a desire to keep the market up for farmers,"" Sir David says.With the coronavirus outbreak, however, that separation between technical advice and politics has itself become contentious. The government stands accused of being too in thrall to science, in particular to epidemiologists, and of paying insufficient attention to other important factors such as the economy and behavioural science.John Ashton, a regional director at Public Health England, has talked about the government treating its favoured epidemiologists as ""demigods"".Even Mark Woolhouse, professor of infectious disease epidemiology at Edinburgh university, while supportive of the lockdown, worries that insufficient attention has been paid to other considerations. ""I am an epidemiologist and I worry that the response is based too much on epidemiology alone,"" he says.Stark conclusions Much of the concern stems from the weight placed by ministers on a report published on March 16 by a team of epidemiologists at Imperial College, London led by Neil Ferguson. Not only did this document warn that, unchecked, the virus could kill 510,000 people, it counselled that even with the government's then preferred strategy of ""mitigation"", more than 250,000 would die, with the National Health Service rapidly becoming wholly overwhelmed.The stark conclusion did not come from Imperial redrawing its model.

373,Coronavirus: Social distancing likely to go on long after the lockdown,"April 16, 2020 Thursday",International,thetimes.co.uk,1093,1093,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,"Chris Smyth, Whitehall Editor | Tom Ball",Coronavirus: Social distancing likely to go on long after the lockdown,"The public has the right to see an exit strategy from lockdown and official secrecy about it could backfire, the government's chief behavioural science adviser has warned.James Rubin, who chairs the behavioural science committee of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies, contradicted ministers' insistence that talking about how restrictions will be eased in future risked undermining the stay-at-home message.Openness about the plan was vital to preserving public trust in ""difficult and costly"" restrictions, Mr Rubin told MPs on the science and technology select committee.Graham Medley, the government's chief pandemic modeller, also warned that there was ""no real answer"" on how to end restrictions, with the only end point to the epidemic being either a vaccine or herd immunity once enough people had been infected.In the meantime the goal had to be to find ways of keeping as few people as possible in quarantine without allowing the outbreak to take off again, he told the committee.Children did not appear to be crucial in spreading the virus but it was not yet clear that schools could safely reopen, Professor Medley added.With lockdown extended for at least three weeks yesterday to allow infections to fall farther, the government has resisted talking about any plans for easing restrictions in the future. Neil Ferguson, the adviser whose work formed the basis of the lockdown strategy, said that social distancing would need to be maintained even as restrictions eased.Matt Hancock, the health secretary, said that talking about ending lockdown risked undermining the clarity of the instruction to stay at home, telling the BBC that government messaging had a ""direct impact"" on cases and deaths. ""The communications are part of the policy, and that is why we will not be distracted into confusing that message,"" he said. ""The scientists can say what they like, the commentators can say what they like, the interviewers can say what they like. We will do what is best by dealing with this virus.""However, Dr Rubin, reader in the psychology of health risks at King's College London, told MPs it was ""very important that people have their expectations set on this"".Earlier Professor Ferguson, of Imperial College London, had said that Britain would need to maintain a ""significant level"" of social distancing even after the lockdown was lifted. Measures would have to stay in place until a vaccine was available - unlikely before the second half of 2021 - to avoid a second outbreak of the coronavirus.The epidemiologist said he believed that the daily number of infections had peaked two weeks ago, but it was ""too early to relax"".Professor Ferguson called for a more co-ordinated exit strategy and said that as restrictions were loosened more testing would be needed to isolate individual cases and trace their contacts.""Our estimates show we have relatively little leeway; if we relax measures too much then we'll see a resurgence of transmission,"" he told                    Today                    on BBC Radio 4. ""If we want to open schools, let people get back to work, then we need to keep transmission down in another manner.""And it's not going to be going back to normal. We will have to maintain some level of social distancing, a significant level, until we have a vaccine available.""Yesterday a three-week extension to the lockdown was announced, along with a series of tests to establish when some easing can begin.Sir Keir Starmer, the Labour leader, has said that his party will back an extension to the lockdown, but he has also urged ministers to set out an exit strategy stating how restrictions will be lifted.Professor Medley, who chairs the SPI-M modelling committee, said Britain was ""stuck here"" in lockdown until a way of easing restrictions could be found that did not restart the epidemic by bringing the ""R value"", the average number of people each person with the infection passes it on to, above one. ""The question is can we find ways in which we have the minimum number of people at home quarantined and still have the R below one. Until we've solved that problem, if we don't want another epidemic then we have to stay in the position we're in,"" he told MPs.Professor Ferguson said he would like to see ""action accelerated"" and called for more infrastructure and an organisation aimed at dealing with the transition to normality.Mr Hancock retorted that Professor Ferguson was not party to the action going on behind the scenes because he was ""not in the government"".Dominic Raab, who is standing in for the prime minister, said that restrictions could begin to be eased once it was clear that the NHS could cope, the death rate was falling in a sustained way, the rate of infection was ""manageable"", there was enough testing and protective equipment, and there was no risk of a second peak.Separately, MPs have called for police to receive training on the new lockdown laws after reports of mistakes. The commons home affairs committee found that the use of the new powers was in most cases ""proportionate and effective"", but urged forces to correct errors quickly ""so that public trust is maintained"".Martin Hewitt, the chairman of the National Police Chiefs' Council (NPCC), said that there had been a ""very small number"" of errors, but that ""tens and tens of thousands"" of encounters with the police had been appropriate. ""Of course, there have been mistakes and I think we have been very quick to come forward when we have made mistakes,"" he said, adding that officers were ""trying to do their best in very, very difficult and unusual circumstances"".The committee recommended ""regular monitoring"" by the NPCC and the College of Policing ""where there is significant divergence in the use of the enforcement measures"".Yvette Cooper, the chairman of the committee, said: ""The speed at which the regulations came in means early errors are unsurprising, as everyone has been feeling their way, and the police need to ensure any mistakes continue to be corrected, and that there are checks and training in place.""We will continue to review the policing response to Covid-19. The wide variation in enforcement does raise questions we will want to consider further.""Priti Patel, the home secretary, added: ""Our police are doing an excellent job in extraordinary circumstances - helping us to protect the NHS and save lives. I welcome the committee's findings that the police's four-step strategy - engage, explain, encourage, and then enforce - is the right approach and has been proportionate and effective.""",Newspaper; Web Publication
374,How the UK's lockdown extension was rubber-stamped on the biggest day of Dominic Raab's political career;The Foreign Secretary chaired a series of virtual meetings with full support for emergency measures continuing,"April 16, 2020 Thursday",International,telegraph.co.uk,1305,1305,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,"By Camilla Tominey, Associate Editor and Gordon Rayner, Political Editor",How the UK's lockdown extension was rubber-stamped on the biggest day of Dominic Raab's political careerThe Foreign Secretary chaired a series of virtual meetings with full support for emergency measures continuing,"The announcement of another three weeks of lockdown was the culmination of a frantic day of video conferencing, with Dominic Raab chairing three high-level meetings in one day as well as attending a 'virtual' G7 summit. Ordinarily a string of such significant political pow wows would have been photographed for prosperity but as Mr Raab stood in for the Prime Minister from the Cabinet room at Number 10, colleagues were beamed into view on Zoom.First up was the 9.15am Covid-19 'war committee' where the cabinet sub group took the first steps towards extending the unprecedented measures until May 7. Ministers later admitted that ""everyone knew that the decision had already been made,"" by the time the full Cabinet met at 11.That meeting lasted more than an hour-longer than expected, with the Foreign Secretary joined on the call by Sir Patrick Vallance, the government's chief scientific advisor.He reportedly relayed both good news and bad news: while the science showed the social distancing measures were working and critical care capacity had been adequately bolstered, Britain still wasn't at ""tipping point"".According to one cabinet minister, there was 'no dissent whatsoever' over the decision to continue with the shutdown put in place by Boris Johnson on March 23.""The consensus was we are going in the right direction but it would be economically much worse in the long run if we try to step out too early and suffer a second wave,"" they added. ""We are getting to that moment but it's not a dot on a graph. We were all of the view that we are not there yet."" Another cabinet insider said: ""They're very much still being led by the science.""Information was fed in from the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (SAGE), the governments' chief scientific advisers, which also met yesterday (Thurs), prompting a discussion about some of the behavioural science around lifting the lockdown.Mr Raab later revealed at the 5pm Downing Street press conference that the SAGE advice was that some settings were still seeing infections spreading and that although the rate of infection (Ro value) showed infected people were passing the disease on to fewer than one other person on average-it was still not as low as it needed to be.""One of the most prominent members of SAGE, Professor Neil Ferguson of Imperial College London, had ruffled feathers in Government earlier in the day by suggesting that ""indefinite"" social distancing will be needed until a vaccine is found, which could take a year or more.Matt Hancock, the Health Secretary, appeared irritated by Mr Ferguson's suggestion when he was asked about it by the BBC, pointing out that Mr Ferguson was ""not a member of the Government"".Mr Ferguson had also suggested a Coronavirus Department should be set up in the same way that the Brexit Department was created by Theresa May, which drew an equally abrupt response from Downing Street. The Prime Minister's spokesman said after the Cabinet meeting that: ""The entire focus of Government is on the response to coronavirus and that is being coordinated centrally by the daily Covid meeting.""Yet on the psychology behind extending the lockdown, again there was Cabinet consensus. Ministers agreed that the public, who have been polled daily by Downing Street, weren't ready for the restrictions to be lifted.""Everyone was very much on the same page,"" said one Cabinet source. ""The priority is protecting people's health and wellbeing.""Although the Prime Minister, who continues to convalesce at Chequers, was not directly involved in any of the meetings, ministers were understood to be mindful of his desire to ""take the people with us.""Amid fears some have 'over-interpreted' the guidance, it was agreed that schools could not reopen if MPs hadn't returned to parliament.An argument is gaining ground that reception year pupils should go back first, because of the huge developmental importance of the first year of formal schooling, followed by other primary years, which are harder to teach via videolink than older children are in secondary schools.Children in Year 10, preparing for GCSEs next year, and in the lower sixth form, sitting A-levels next summer, could also go back sooner than other years because they are such a vital stage of their education.Butwhile some ministers are pushing for schools to return before half term at the end of May, others are far more cautious, pointing out that it would be ""all risk and no reward"" because the public has already come to terms with the idea of schools being closed until then, and there is an inherent risk in sending children back to school where classrooms could become incubators for the virus.While there is currently no exit plan in place, discussions are already understood to have taken place about a sector by sector lifting of the lockdown, with ministers raising the question of why you can't open more shops if supermarkets can enforce social distancing, and a desire to increase construction.Much of the rest of conversation focused on whether Secretaries of State will return to Westminster physically or virtually following the Easter recess next week. MPs are set to be able to quiz ministers via Zoom for the first time in the House of Commons 700-year history, following agreement by the House authorities.Approval has been given to allow up to 120 MPs at any one time to take part in proceedings virtually, while around 50 could remain in the chamber under strict social distancing rules.But it is not yet known whether cabinet ministers will appear in person or from home. One cabinet minister said: ""The House will be sitting but in what physical capacity we're still not sure. I'm expecting to take questions next week, but I'm still not sure how I will be doing it.""Another insider revealed: ""The feeling was you can't have too many MPs coming back to Parliament while the country's still locked down.""Ministers called for as much cross party cooperation as possible to ensure that there were no ""contentious"" issues arising over the course of the next three weeks.A Downing Street spokesman said: ""The clear message from Cabinet was to thank the public for the enormous sacrifices which have been made so far to slow the spread of the virus. They have protected the NHS and saved lives.""The Cabinet agreed to be guided by the scientific advice and to take the right decisions at the right time.""In what proved to be the biggest day of Mr Raab's political career, the 46-year-old father of two went on to attend a virtual meeting of G7 leaders including Donald Trump and German Chancellor Angela Merkel.The video conference, which was chaired by the US President since America currently holds the G7 Presidency, assessed the joint progress made in combating the Covid-19 pandemic and its immediate consequence.Mr Raab is understood to have pushed for international collaboration on both the economic and global health response to the outbreak. As well as calling for the production of vaccines, treatments and tests to be sped up internationally, he urged joint G7 action to support more vulnerable countries.The meeting came after President Trump announced he was postponing funding to the World Health Organisation (WHO) while a review was conducted to assess its ""role in severely mismanaging and covering up the spread of the coronavirus"". He also criticised the organisation's relationship with China.Having spent most of the day in the Cabinet room at Number 10, from where he had chaired the morning Covid-19 committee meeting and Cabinet, Mr Raab then dialled in to Zoom again to chair a 3.30pm meeting of the Cobra emergency committee, where the inevitable decision to extend until at least the early Spring bank holiday was rubber-stamped. Four Zoom conferences and a press conference later, there was still no end in sight. ",Newspaper; Web Publication
375,Raab points way to 'light at end of the tunnel';Five conditions set before lockdown can be eased,"April 16, 2020 Thursday",International,thetimes.co.uk,1246,1246,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,"Francis Elliott, Political Editor | Steven Swinford, Chris Smyth",Raab points way to 'light at end of the tunnel'Five conditions set before lockdown can be eased,"Britain was offered ""light at the end of the tunnel"" at the start of a further three weeks in lockdown with the promise of less social distancing if a five-point test were met.Dominic Raab, who is deputising for Boris Johnson, urged the public to remain patient as he confirmed that the lockdown would remain ""at least"" until May 7 despite signs that the worst of the pandemic was starting to pass.He said that easing the restrictions now would ""risk sacrificing all the progress we have made"" and result in a second wave of infections.Urging the public to show patience and stick with the restrictions to stop the spread of the virus, he said: ""There is light at the end of the tunnel but we are now at both a delicate and a dangerous stage in this pandemic.""He told a Downing Street press conference that the lockdown would not suddenly be lifted next month and could last into June. ""It could mean relaxing measures in some areas, while strengthening measures in other areas,"" he said, as he set out five tests that would have to be met for restrictions to begin to be relaxed.They are: ensuring that the NHS can cope across Britain; a sustained and consistent fall in the daily death rate; evidence that the rate of infection is decreasing to ""manageable levels""; enough testing and protective equipment to meet demand; and no risk of a second peak large enough to overwhelm the NHS.Grant Shapps, the transport secretary, said today that Mr Raab's five-point test contained ""all the common sense things"". He told Sky News: ""We need to be absolutely clear that when we release some of these measures that we don't end up in a second wave that just then comes back and all the great work that the British public have done could be undone if we don't get the timing of that right.""In other developments: Analysis found that one in ten people who have died from coronavirus in England and Wales had no underlying health condition. Mr Raab said that China would face ""hard questions"" about the source of the pandemic and warned it would not be ""business as usual after the crisis"". Ministers ordered 15,000 ventilators to treat coronavirus patients after the first newly adapted device was approved by the regulator.Tom Moore, a 99-year-old army veteran who set out to raise £1,000 for the NHS by walking round his garden 100 times, achieved more than £15 million in donations. Downing Street hinted that it supported awarding a collective George Cross to NHS workers in recognition of their role in tackling coronavirus.President Trump promised to ease lockdown restrictions as he said the US had ""passed the peak"" of Covid-19 cases.Standing beside Mr Raab, Sir Patrick Vallance, the government's chief scientific adviser, said that the ""reproductive number"" for the virus was now less than one, meaning that for every person with the virus less than one new person was being infected.""The overall message is that new cases are at least flattening and may be decreasing,"" he said, adding: ""Sage [the government's scientific advisers] looked very carefully at all of the evidence and [are] of the opinion that it is highly likely that the R is below one - the transmission force of the virus is below one, meaning that one person will, on average, be infecting fewer than one other person.""That's an important change. It means in the community it's likely that the virus and the epidemic is now shrinking.""Mr Raab said, however, that it was not right to talk about ending the lockdown. ""It would be irresponsible for us to set out in more detail the measures being considered as potential options because we don't have the data yet,"" he said.He refused to outline a timetable for easing restrictions and instead highlighted Mr Johnson's statement on March 19 that it would take 12 weeks to ""turn the tide"". He said: ""The prime minister said at the outset that it would take three months to come through the peak and I think that, broadly, is still the outline. We can't give a definitive time frame, that would be to prejudge the evidence . . . But our message to the British public is: there is light at the end of the tunnel, we are making progress, but at the same time we must keep up the social-distancing measures.""Sir Keir Starmer, the Labour leader, put fresh pressure on ministers to set out a more defined exit strategy, claiming Dominic Raab was ""reluctant"" to act decisively with Boris Johnson still recovering from the virus. He told the BBC: ""They've been in a position probably for a week or ten days now where it's been difficult for the government to make big decisions.""Mr Shapps responded that it was ""categorically not true"" government was at a standstill without the prime minister.At Holyrood Nicola Sturgeon, the first minister, said that Scotland's exit strategy would be published next week.Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London, said that the capital's residents should wear masks, heaping pressure on the government to drop official guidance that does not recommend them. ""The evidence around the world is that [masks are] effective,"" he told the BBC. It was reported last night that ministers were considering whether to ask employees to wear masks in the office to allow a widespread return to work.James Rubin, who chairs the behavioural science committee of Sage, criticised the government claim that discussing exit strategies was irresponsible. He told MPs: ""People need to understand, and have a right to understand, what the plan is.""Matt Hancock, the health secretary, will today face questions on the government's response to the pandemic when he appears before a virtual session of the commons health committee. He is likely to be questioned on the government's exit strategy from the lockdown and lack of PPE for the NHS.                   Analysis: Epidemic may be shrinking                    The most important figure in epidemiology is the reproduction number. Also known as R0 - ""R-nought"" - it tells you how many new cases are created on average by each infected person (Rhys Blakely writes).If R0 is less than one, the epidemic will die out; if it is greater than one it will probably grow.According to the government's scientific advisers, for the coronavirus it is somewhere between 0.5 and 1. Before the lockdown it was between 2 and 3.""It means in the community it is likely that the epidemic is now shrinking,"" Sir Patrick Vallance, the government's chief scientific adviser, told reporters yesterday.The decline was possible because R0 is not a fixed value. It depends on the environment that the virus inhabits. On a crowded train a coughing commuter might infect a dozen people; if the same person spends a day sneezing alone at home, they infect nobody. The more people stay at home, the lower R0 will fall.It does not have to be very much above 1 to cause tens of thousands of deaths: seasonal flu has an R0 that hovers around 1.3 and it infects millions of people every year.That is why Sir Patrick sounded a cautious note. For any new virus, calculating R0 is not easy. That seems especially true of Covid-19, a disease that often entails only mild symptoms where we are not clear how many cases there have been. Some people might have been infected without showing symptoms.""If the R0 goes above one, [cases] start to grow again fast, and it may be quite difficult to predict and detect that growth,"" Sir Patrick said. ""Then we run the risk of a second peak, with all of the damage that will cause to health and the economy.""",Newspaper; Web Publication

The research was conducted by Oxford University's Nuffield Department of Medicine, which is advising the government and the NHS on the creation of such an app.Experts said basing an app around symptoms rather than waiting for test results could make a crucial difference to stopping the spread of Covid-19.The app would alert users if someone they had come into contact with had tested positive for the disease, and encourage them to take precautionary action.Dr David Bonsall, co-lead on the research and a clinician at the John Radcliffe Hospital, said: ""Initiating contact tracing based on symptoms makes sense epidemiologically because it's fast enough to reach people before they transmit.""Our simulations predict loss of epidemic control when tracing is delayed to wait for test results, and overall results in more deaths, and more people in quarantine.""You achieve the best of both worlds when virological tests are used to follow-up and promptly release people. With the right configuration, we can all use the technology to save lives and help to protect vulnerable groups.""The experts used a model city of one million people to simulate the impact of contact tracing software.The research suggested that as well as speed, a large number of users would also be needed to effectively slow the spread.It indicates that if around 60% of the whole population -and 80% of those with a smartphone -used the software alongside other interventions it could stop the pandemic, but even a lower usage rate could at least slow the spread.Professor Christophe Fraser, senior author of the Nuffield report, said: ""Our results suggest a digital contact tracing app, if carefully implemented alongside other measures, has the potential to substantially reduce the number of new coronavirus cases, hospitalisations and ICU admissions.""Our models show we can stop the epidemic if approximately 60% of the population use the app, and even with lower numbers of app users, we still estimate a reduction in the number of coronavirus cases and deaths.""According to a survey carried out by behavioural economists working with the Oxford University team, just over 73% of people in the UK would be likely to install a contact tracing app for Covid-19.The experts added it is important any concerns about privacy and data usage are addressed at every stage of app development.Health Secretary Matt Hancock has said developers of the NHS app are working with the world's leading tech companies and experts in clinical safety and digital ethics ""so that we can get this right"".Prof Fraser said he hopes the new research would help push forward the development of an app.""We need strategies to exit from the lockdown whilst minimising the risk of resurgence,"" he said.""Combined with other interventions such as community testing and continued shielding of vulnerable individuals, digital contact tracing can help prevent coronavirus from rapidly re-emerging.""We hope these latest findings will provide valuable evidence that mobile contact tracing can be carefully deployed after consideration of key epidemiological parameters, combined with critical ethical principles, to ensure we can save lives, reduce the number of people who need to remain in self-isolation, and support as many people as possible to safely and responsibly start returning to active life again.""A separate Policy Exchange report says a new cross-government and multi-agency testing and tracing command centre should be created to oversee the response to the crisis.It says the centre would be led by a single individual with experience in command, control, coordination and communication and involve input from the NHS and other health authorities, the Government, police, military, intelligence agencies and the private sector.Co-authored by Richard Walton, Policy Exchange senior fellow and former head of counter-terrorism command in the Metropolitan Police, the report also urges the Government to make a national appeal to the UK population to subscribe to the contact tracing app.""The recent outbreak of Covid-19 has exposed the limitations of traditional manual contact tracing methods, a fact that leaders of some Asian economies -including South Korea and Singapore -had already understood after their handling of previous pandemics,"" Mr Walton said.""The UK will need to go much further in the use of new technology if it is to suppress further outbreaks of the disease. A testing and tracing command centre will be essential to this effort.""                     Additional reporting by agencies                   ",Newspaper; Web Publication

National Records of Scotland published its second weekly coronavirus bulletin yesterday, which revealed an excess 251 deaths.There have now been 1,515 more deaths under lockdown than in an average April. Only 962 have been attributed to Covid-19.Nicola Sturgeon admitted that she faced a ""horrendously difficult challenge"" in weighing the costs of the lockdown in lives and economic hardship with the inevitable deaths from Covid-19 that will result if she lifts the restrictions. The first minister said yesterday that it would be vital to understand the reasons behind then extra deaths as the lockdown continues for the foreseeable future, with no sign of a vaccine emerging soon.Linda Bauld, a behavioural scientist at Edinburgh University, raised concerns last week that people were dying at home from heart attacks and other treatable conditions because they did not want to bother GPs. Conditions such as diabetes or high blood pressure are also thought to be harder to manage in lockdown.Professor Bauld also voiced fears that people were drinking themselves to death or committing suicide due to stress of the lockdown and a loss of earnings. Sir Harry Burns, who was chief medical officer for Scotland between 2005-2014, suggested that some of the deaths would be due to organ failure brought on by undiagnosed Covid-19 infections.Yesterday Ms Sturgeon said the rising death rate from non-Covid 19 illnesses was ""still being explored"" and was a global phenomenon.Dr Gregor Smith, the interim chief medical officer for Scotland, said: ""I think it is very likely that we will see a variety of contributing factors rather than one single factor that is producing this very clear excess above what we would expect.""In England and Wales last week there were 6,000 deaths above the five-year average, with 3,475 recorded as related to coronavirus.",Newspaper

The announcement on Thursday 16 April comes hours after Mr Raab chaired a Cobra meeting to discuss the current social restrictions in place.The extension has been put in place for ""at least"" three weeks which will take the UK to May 7, when we can expect a second review.Mr Raab, who is deputising for Boris Johnson, said the Government was being ""as open as we responsibly can at this stage"". ""It would not be responsible to prejudge the evidence that Sage will have and review in just a few weeks' time.""The Foreign Secretary said the Government carefully followed what is happening in other countries but ""we've got to do what is right for the British people based on the advice of our experts, grounded in the conditions prevailing here in the UK"".He said that measures put in place had been successful but that SAGE said that some settings were still seeing infections spreading.He warned that relaxing social restrictions now would damage economy in the longterm.•How other countries are ending lockdown                     Is lockdown working?                     Less than 12 hours after the Prime Minister's historic address to the nation on March 23, the London Underground was jammed with commuters (see video below), while builders were seen eating together in communal canteens, making a mockery of the Government's rule that no more than two people can gather together in public.Professor Susan Michie, Director of the University College London's Centre for Behaviour Change, warned that some people would simply not be able to carry out the measures, even if they wanted to.""Five million self-employed people are being left potentially destitute by the Government failing to offer financial supportas they have done for directly employed workers,"" she said. ""Since [statutory sick pay of] £94 is not enough to pay rent, bills, food for a family etc, they will be forced to carry on as usual.""The British Transport Police is now on hand to make sure only            critical workers are using the London Underground. But such an inauspicious start to the lockdown suggests the virus will spread further than it would have, had stricter measures been implemented earlier,            as they have in other countries. And it means that the measures we do have are likely to be in place for longer to ""flatten the curve"" in a way that would prevent a second dangerous peak.In addition, on April 1 the Government revealed figures that suggested the lockdown was starting to fray as data showed an ""uptick""            in the number of people using transport.The number of those using their cars and public transport, which had been consistently dropping since strict social distancing measures were introduced, rose for the first time.It is feared that sunny weather will prompt more people to break the rules and go outside to socialise as boredom kicks in.How long will lockdown last?Mr Raab said the Government needed to be satisfied of five things before it would consider it safe to adjust any of the current measures:•Protect the NHS's ability to cope and be confident that the NHS is able to provide sufficient critical care across the UK.•See a sustained and consistent fall in daily death rates to be confident the UK is beyond the peak.•Reliable data from Sage showing rate of infection is decreasing to manageable levels across the board.•Confident that testing capacity and PPE are in hand with supply able to meet future demand.•Confident that any adjustments to the current measures would not risk a second peak in infections which would overwhelm the NHS.When the lockdown was first announced, Professor Mark Woolhouse, Professor of Infectious Disease Epidemiology, University of Edinburgh, said: ""We now enter a phase of careful monitoring. We are looking for indicators first that the epidemic is slowing down and then for numbers of new cases to start to fall. ""After three weeks we will have to decide whether the restrictions need to be continued, can be relaxed, or can be relaxed temporarily with the expectation of imposing them again later. ""We must also monitor the damage that the lockdown is doing; damage to the economy, to education, to psychological well-being and to health and social care provision in the community. The impacts of this epidemic are too far reaching for policy decisions to be driven by epidemiology alone.""Professor Sheila Bird said that more cases in coming weeks would make it easier for the Government to predict how the epidemic is responding to lockdown measures, which will inform how long they remain in place. ""Once an epidemic takes hold, as now in UK, the country's own data - properly reported and interpreted - take precedence over modelling as the data tell us the actual toll which the epidemic is exacting,"" she said.""A huge amount can be inferred about the immediately forthcoming weeks from these data directly, including whether further policy changes are needed to reinforce social-distancing; for example in particular age groups.""Some experts are still concerned that the current restrictions do not go far enough while others say the government has been hit by an ""epidemic of action"", and is now bringing in measures that have little rationale. Professor Robert Dingwall, Professor of Sociology, at Nottingham Trent University, wrote in The Telegraph: ""It is another triumph of populism over science, of a capitulation to the demand to 'do something'. ""We are still seeing some notion that 'the people' are selfish and must be bullied and disciplined. ""The people are not selfish; they have behaved in ways that are individually rational but have collectively irrational results.""However Dr Andrea Collins, Senior Clinical Lecturer in Respiratory Medicine at the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine (LSTM), said: ""I believe that they have not quite gone far enough. The 'absolutely' necessary to go to work is still being used by some when it is not required-I think we need permits across controlled areas to go to a workplace.""Recent modelling from the universities of Exeter, Bristol and Warwick suggested that without any measures at all, the epidemic would have peaked around 133 days after first person-to-person transmission in Britain, which happened around February 28. So the lockdown has the potential of curtailing the spread by around seven weeks. A welcome relief for people who could have been facing lockdown for most of the summer.",Newspaper; Web Publication

""If we want to open schools, let people get back to work, then we need to keep transmission down in another manner.""And it's not going to be going back to normal. We will have to maintain some level of social distancing, a significant level, until we have a vaccine available.""Yesterday a three-week extension to the lockdown was announced, along with a series of tests to establish when some easing can begin.Sir Keir Starmer, the Labour leader, has said that his party will back an extension to the lockdown, but he has also urged ministers to set out an exit strategy stating how restrictions will be lifted. Professor Medley, who chairs the SPI-M modelling committee, said Britain was ""stuck here"" in lockdown until a way of easing restrictions could be found that did not restart the epidemic by bringing the ""R value"", the average number of people each person with the infection passes it on to, above one. ""The question is can we find ways in which we have the minimum number of people at home quarantined and still have the R below one. Until we've solved that problem, if we don't want another epidemic then we have to stay in the position we're in,"" he told MPs.Professor Ferguson said he would like to see ""action accelerated"" and called for more infrastructure and an organisation aimed at dealing with the transition to normality.Mr Hancock retorted that Professor Ferguson was not party to the action going on behind the scenes because he was ""not in the government"".Dominic Raab, who is standing in for the prime minister, said that restrictions could begin to be eased once it was clear that the NHS could cope, the death rate was falling in a sustained way, the rate of infection was ""manageable"", there was enough testing and protective equipment, and there was no risk of a second peak.Iain Martin, page 21 Letters, page 22",Newspaper

""I really must encourage people experiencing life-threatening or life-changing things to go to hospital,"" he said. NHS leaders are concerned that the quality of care being given to seriously ill patients is falling as hospitals struggle with drastically changed conditions that raise ""obvious risks"" of harm. Page 4 Lockdown exit demand The public has the right to see an exit strategy from the lockdown, James Rubin, the government's chief behavioural science adviser, said, as he contradicted ministers' insistence that talking about how restrictions would be eased risked undermining the stay-at-home message. Neil Ferguson, whose team provided the modelling that informed the lockdown strategy, said that Britain would need to maintain a ""significant level"" of social distancing even after the curbs were lifted.

392,"How long will the UK coronavirus lockdown last?;Dominic Raab has extended UK lockdown for a further three weeks and said restrictions will not be lifted until changes can be ""safely"" made","April 17, 2020 Friday",International,telegraph.co.uk,1093,1093,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,"By Sarah Knapton, Science Editor","How long will the UK coronavirus lockdown last?Dominic Raab has extended UK lockdown for a further three weeks and said restrictions will not be lifted until changes can be ""safely"" made","The Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab has extended UK lockdown measures for a further three weeks to prevent the spread of Covid-19. The announcement on Thursday 16 April comes hours after Mr Raab chaired a Cobra meeting to discuss the current social restrictions in place.The extension has been put in place for ""at least"" three weeks which will take the UK to May 7, when we can expect a second review.Mr Raab, who is deputising for Boris Johnson, said the Government was being ""as open as we responsibly can at this stage"". ""It would not be responsible to prejudge the evidence that Sage will have and review in just a few weeks' time.""The Foreign Secretary said the Government carefully followed what is happening in other countries but ""we've got to do what is right for the British people based on the advice of our experts, grounded in the conditions prevailing here in the UK"".He said that measures put in place had been successful but that SAGE said that some settings were still seeing infections spreading.He warned that relaxing social restrictions now would damage economy in the longterm.•How other countries are ending lockdown                     Is lockdown working?                     Less than 12 hours after the Prime Minister's historic address to the nation on March 23, the London Underground was jammed with commuters (see video below), while builders were seen eating together in communal canteens, making a mockery of the Government's rule that no more than two people can gather together in public.Professor Susan Michie, Director of the University College London's Centre for Behaviour Change, warned that some people would simply not be able to carry out the measures, even if they wanted to.""Five million self-employed people are being left potentially destitute by the Government failing to offer financial supportas they have done for directly employed workers,"" she said. ""Since [statutory sick pay of] £94 is not enough to pay rent, bills, food for a family etc, they will be forced to carry on as usual.""The British Transport Police is now on hand to make sure only            critical workers are using the London Underground. But such an inauspicious start to the lockdown suggests the virus will spread further than it would have, had stricter measures been implemented earlier,            as they have in other countries. And it means that the measures we do have are likely to be in place for longer to ""flatten the curve"" in a way that would prevent a second dangerous peak.In addition, on April 1 the Government revealed figures that suggested the lockdown was starting to fray as data showed an ""uptick""            in the number of people using transport.The number of those using their cars and public transport, which had been consistently dropping since strict social distancing measures were introduced, rose for the first time.It is feared that sunny weather will prompt more people to break the rules and go outside to socialise as boredom kicks in.How long will lockdown last?Mr Raab said the Government needed to be satisfied of five things before it would consider it safe to adjust any of the current measures:•Protect the NHS's ability to cope and be confident that the NHS is able to provide sufficient critical care across the UK.•See a sustained and consistent fall in daily death rates to be confident the UK is beyond the peak.•Reliable data from Sage showing rate of infection is decreasing to manageable levels across the board.•Confident that testing capacity and PPE are in hand with supply able to meet future demand.•Confident that any adjustments to the current measures would not risk a second peak in infections which would overwhelm the NHS.When the lockdown was first announced, Professor Mark Woolhouse, Professor of Infectious Disease Epidemiology, University of Edinburgh, said: ""We now enter a phase of careful monitoring. We are looking for indicators first that the epidemic is slowing down and then for numbers of new cases to start to fall. ""After three weeks we will have to decide whether the restrictions need to be continued, can be relaxed, or can be relaxed temporarily with the expectation of imposing them again later. ""We must also monitor the damage that the lockdown is doing; damage to the economy, to education, to psychological well-being and to health and social care provision in the community. The impacts of this epidemic are too far reaching for policy decisions to be driven by epidemiology alone.""Professor Sheila Bird said that more cases in coming weeks would make it easier for the Government to predict how the epidemic is responding to lockdown measures, which will inform how long they remain in place. ""Once an epidemic takes hold, as now in UK, the country's own data - properly reported and interpreted - take precedence over modelling as the data tell us the actual toll which the epidemic is exacting,"" she said.""A huge amount can be inferred about the immediately forthcoming weeks from these data directly, including whether further policy changes are needed to reinforce social-distancing; for example in particular age groups.""Some experts are still concerned that the current restrictions do not go far enough while others say the government has been hit by an ""epidemic of action"", and is now bringing in measures that have little rationale. Professor Robert Dingwall, Professor of Sociology, at Nottingham Trent University, wrote in The Telegraph: ""It is another triumph of populism over science, of a capitulation to the demand to 'do something'. ""We are still seeing some notion that 'the people' are selfish and must be bullied and disciplined. ""The people are not selfish; they have behaved in ways that are individually rational but have collectively irrational results.""However Dr Andrea Collins, Senior Clinical Lecturer in Respiratory Medicine at the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine (LSTM), said: ""I believe that they have not quite gone far enough. The 'absolutely' necessary to go to work is still being used by some when it is not required-I think we need permits across controlled areas to go to a workplace.""Recent modelling from the universities of Exeter, Bristol and Warwick suggested that without any measures at all, the epidemic would have peaked around 133 days after first person-to-person transmission in Britain, which happened around February 28. So the lockdown has the potential of curtailing the spread by around seven weeks. A welcome relief for people who could have been facing lockdown for most of the summer.",Newspaper; Web Publication
393,"As lockdown lingers, herd immunity rears its head again;Questions remain over the UK Government's strategy as the number of deaths from Covid-19 continue to rise","April 18, 2020 Saturday",International,telegraph.co.uk,2343,2343,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,By Daniel Foggo and Katherine Rushton and Sophie Barnes,"As lockdown lingers, herd immunity rears its head againQuestions remain over the UK Government's strategy as the number of deaths from Covid-19 continue to rise","Looking back, it was a moment that Sir Patrick Vallance may now view as regrettable.As he articulated the government's decision to pursue a policy of ""herd immunity"" to the television journalist interviewing him, the Chief Scientific Adviser stressed that it was only following ""the most up to date and relevant advice"" from the experts appointed to navigate a way through the unfolding coronavirus crisis.Herd immunity, he explained, would necessitate around 60 per cent of the country contracting the disease so that, once recovered, their bodies' acquired antibodies would effectively protect the rest of the population, too.It was put to him that, with the virus having an estimated fatality rate of up to one per cent, that was potentially an awful lot of deaths to countenance. Sir Patrick couldn't deny it.""That is a real prospect, this is a nasty disease.""Neither he nor his interlocutor spelled out the numbers, but anyone with an elementary grasp of maths could have deduced that achieving herd immunity might therefore cost the lives of hundreds of thousands of people. That interview was on March 13, a day after Sir Patrick, side by side with Boris Johnson, had first floated the idea of herd immunity at a press conference.The PM had also taken that opportunity to declare that people with mild symptoms of the coronavirus should self-isolate themselves at home for a week but stopped short of calling for the cancelling of mass gatherings or closing schools.It has now emerged that for nearly a fortnight the government had been privy to scientific advice from Imperial College, London, which had forecast mass casualties from the Covid-19 strain. Mathematical modelling of potential deaths had been made available as early as March 1, according to Professor Neil Ferguson, who led the Imperial team.Furthermore, on March 12, the date of the ""herd immunity"" press conference, Imperial had presented a further study to the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (SAGE) which predicted a quarter of a million fatalities in the UK unless truly stringent measures were taken to suppress the virus.Yet here was Sir Patrick, a day later, insisting that fully suppressing the virus with a lengthy lockdown was unhelpful as it would only lead to a second, potentially larger, outbreak towards the end of the year.""We want to...not suppress it so we get the second peak and also allow enough of us who are going to get mild illness to become immune to this to help with the sort of whole population response, which would protect everybody.""Sir Patrick may not have known it, but the ground was already shifting beneath him. According to insiders, the latest offering from Imperial had indeed made an impact and a seismic change in thinking was now taking place in the government's inner circle. Actually seeing the numbers starkly on a page - 250,000 deaths unless we lockdown the country - had apparently concentrated a few minds.The result was that, even as herd immunity was being expounded on national television by the hapless Sir Patrick, the very real prospect of abandoning its pursuit of was now being actively considered in No10. The government was about to change direction, but it was hardly to be a handbrake turn.It was a full eleven days after the Imperial study's call for full suppression before Mr Johnson announced that he was putting the country into lockdown. That was nearly four weeks ago, and since then the line from the government has been consistent: stay at home, only go out for essentials such as food or exercise and keep the vulnerable isolated.For now, it seems, the country is on a single, straight, Imperial-sanctioned path.                     Questions remain over Government strategy                   Why did it take so long to get here? Is it definitely the right path? And how do we go from here, in an unsustainable state of economic stasis, back to something resembling normality? The key to understanding the first of those questions lies in the structure of the committees set up to advise the government in such times of crisis.SAGE, and the three sub-committees which feed into it, are comprised of a range of scientists, the identities of whom are largely unknown, apparently in order to protect them from threats. This opaque nature, and the fact that the committees are dominated by epidemiologists, behavioural scientists and particularly mathematical modellers, has led to criticism.Professor Anthony Costello, of University College's Institute for Global Health, says: ""I think that is quite a narrow view of science. You needed independent public health scientists, social health scientists, IT people, logisticians - and maybe citizen scientists - people that understand how you collect data on a large scale from communities and feed it back to them.""Until the pivotal Imperial report was acted upon, it had appeared to some that the government was actually most in thrall to the behavioural scientists. One report, submitted to SAGE on March 4, examined the potential public resistance to various anti-viral interventions, such as school closures, and concluded they would be ""highly disruptive"" and ""likely to present an unequal burden to different sections of society.""Some committee members clearly felt it would cause to ""discontent"" to isolate only vulnerable people. But others said that explaining that the rest of the population was building herd immunity for them ""will make this acceptable.""This kind of advice, together with the naturally liberalist instincts of Mr Johnson himself, seems to have contributed to the delay in bringing in lockdown.Prof Costello says of the Prime Minister, ""He wants people to be pretty free. The thing that they didn't realise was that every week's delay on an exponential part of the curve can be a disaster.""Prof Costello points to other countries, such as Ireland, as examples of how more effective actions could have been taken earlier, as does Sir David King, the Chief Scientific Adviser between 2000 and 2007. Sir David says that allowing the Cheltenham races, as pictured below, in the second week of March, for instance, had been a clear error.His own son caught the coronavirus while attending the four-day festival, but has now recovered.""I do know Patrick Vallance rather well and have enormous respect for him and think he's the right man in the right job. I cannot believe that Patrick, knowing what he knows about epidemics, would have said go ahead with Cheltenham.""I can't believe that that was the science advice. A big crowd of jostling people all trying to lay bets and collect money at the same time, it's just the formula for spread.""Sir David's perception is that, unlike in his time as Chief Scientific Adviser, when he advised and politicians listened, now it is more like the other way round with scientific advisers kept on a tight rein. And having worked with Mr Johnson when he was London Mayor, he says, ""It was very clear that he does want people to like him and as a scientist he certainly showed that he enjoyed listening to what I had to say, but I became aware that the next person walking into his office who said the opposite to me would get the same treatment.""                     The government locks down, but now what?                   Having finally opted for lockdown, the government is now being accused by some academics of having swallowed the Imperial study too readily and depending too much on the mathematical modellers.Professor Richard Sullivan, co-director of the conflict and health research group at King's College, London, says, ""They went from almost nothing, which was 'oh, we're going to ban a few mass gatherings here' to the full lockdown, just like that.""Prof Sullivan says that he has argued for the modelling to include the unintended consequences of the lockdown on public health, but that his pleas have been ignored. He fears those suffering from non-Covid-19 conditions will now suffer.""That [model] took into no account the indirect causes and consequences. And so, as politicians they panicked and they went for the extreme lockdown because they were told it's the only thing that's going to save the NHS.""The mistake that was made was the models were not red-teamed properly, which means you give it to other people in other areas who model other indirect causes, you say what's wrong with this model?...They were not exposed to a sufficient critique.""The problem with mathematical modellers, he adds, is that ""the modelling community in infectious diseases is a very closed and very small community. So if you get it right, of course you get it right, but if you get it wrong you can't see you've got it wrong.""Whether Prof Ferguson at Imperial has got it wrong on Covid-19 remains to be seen, but certainly some of his past pronouncements over pandemics have appeared to fall well wide of the mark.His research that sparked the mass culling of farm animals during the 2001 epidemic of foot and mouth disease was disputed.In 2002 Prof Ferguson got involved in the BSE crisis, which had years earlier seen the then agriculture minister John Selwyn Gummer attempt to reassure the public that it was safe to eat beef by feeding a hamburger to his four-year-old daughter.Prof Ferguson authored a report speculating that BSE in cows and sheep could cause up to 150,000 human deaths: to date is fewer than 200. Three years later he aired the possibility of bird flu leading to 200 million deaths and then said in 2009 that swine flu could kill up to 4 million.The sum total of the death toll for both diseases was in fact around 19,000.Prof Ferguson, however, stands by the integrity of his modelling.As the debate over the justification for the lockdown goes on, now the government is also facing pressure over its insistence that the use of face masks for everyday use by the general public is unnecessary. The official line has been that unless you are in close contact with someone a mask is not going to make much difference and can, conversely, make people less careful about keeping their distance while making them more prone to touching their own masks and faces.But the Government is now considering revising its stance, following a prediction from David Nabarro, the World Health Organisation special envoy on Covid-19, that they could play a role in our eventual exit from the lockdown. He says, ""I'm envisaging in the coming weeks and months that as people start trying to get back to what I call the new normal - the Covid-ready normal - they will be wanting to wear face protection.""He says that after the SARS outbreak in Asia ""people used to tell me, one of the reasons they wear masks is they want to do everything possible to keep safe. The second reason is to show to others that they're taking it seriously.""                     What is the exit strategy?                   The exit strategy is very much on academic minds. For this part of the process, we should definitely not rely solely on the mathematical modellers, says Robert Dingwall, Professor of Social Sciences at Nottingham Trent University, and an advisor to one of the SAGE sub committees.""There is a space in the policy making that might be occupied by a combination of sociologists, political scientists and historians who have worked on previous pandemics...you could argue there is a gap in the system of expert advice for that kind of input.""Modellers are smart people but they're mathematicians primarily and that's why you need to set their advice into a social and economic context. That's why you need to have an understanding of the real world.""Ferguson for example keeps talking about social distancing as a kind of all or nothing thing. Whereas if we're going to talk about an exit strategy, there isn't going to be a VE day where we declare it's all over.""One problem, he says, is that ""the government have ramped up the level of fear to a point where it's very hard for people to hear the messages about 'this is the way out'."" He describes the lockdown on parks, for instance, as ""cruel and unjust.""""It's a policy by people like me who live in houses with big gardens.""If the politicians are trying to follow the science, and the science is only giving them a limited range of input, then it might be quite difficult for some of these everyday considerations to get taken more seriously.""Prof Sullivan echoes some of those points: ""I think the fear out there is extraordinary. Now, it's our view that the fear is out of all proportion to the threat and the risk. There's been a real perspective loss here.""I keep saying to people we have as many if not more people dying of pneumonia and loads of other conditions. I think life has to start renormalizing again with sufficient care and attention to the vulnerable.""In addition to the search for a vaccine, comprehensive testing of the population so that infected people - and anyone they have had contact with-can remain in isolation, will also be essential. Only then, it seems, can the rest of us - with or without masks - realistically hope to return to something resembling normality.But with the government struggling to even reach its projected target for the end of the month of 100,000 tests a day, that goal feels a long way off, as does a vaccine, which could take a year or even two to produce on the necessary scale. According to some scientists, the only other option might involve us coming full circle.Prof Sullivan says that, even after sorting out testing and the provision of adequate personal protection equipment, ""I'm afraid it comes down to this problem of, are we going to wait for two years for a vaccine which may never happen?""Of course not. The British economy and society will be finished by then. So, your only option here is about building up herd immunity.""After all this, herd immunity?But then, as Professor Chris Whitty, the Chief Medical Officer told the media last week, ""The thing about scientific advice is that it evolves.""Perhaps Sir Patrick won't find he has anything to regret after all.

The animals are smaller than other orangutan species, with paler, thicker fur adapted to living at altitude.British TV viewers will have their first chance to study their behaviour in a nature documentary this month, after a BBC crew spent weeks scouring their home in Batang Toru, northern Sumatra. The rare footage they obtained, showing two Tapanuli orangutans, a mother and her infant will be broadcast in Primates, a new three-part series from the BBC Natural History Unit, known for landmark documentaries such as Blue Planet II and Planet Earth II.The infant is shown embracing the mother, swinging in the trees and learning to seek out the diverse range of plant food they need to survive.Mike Gunton, creative director of the Natural History Unit and the show's executive producer, said that it was very pleasing to introduce audiences to a new species, especially one so similar to humans.""These are our closest relatives and to find a new one is always amazing,"" he said. He described the footage as exquisite but poignant, given the very real threat of extinction.Until recently, scientists recognised only two species of orangutan, the Bornean (Pongo pygmaeus) and the Sumatran (Pongo abelii). The Tapanuli orangutan (Pongo tapanuliensis) was identified as a distinct third species by an international team of scientists in 2017, based on genetic and behavioural analysis. A key piece of evidence was the skull of a Tapanuli male killed by villagers in 2013; it was smaller than other orangutan skulls. Tapanuli are thought to have split from Bornean orangutans 674,000 years ago, and been entirely isolated from other populations for about 20,000 years.The great apes have previously been filmed by academic researchers, but never for mainstream television.Primates is BBC One's latest natural history series devoted to particular species, after Shark in 2015 and Big Cats in 2018.It features new footage of dozens of animals, including bearded capuchin monkeys from Brazil who have learnt how to use tools to hunt for food, wild bush-babies breaking into a South African zoo, and silverback mountain gorillas in the Democratic Republic of Congo's Virunga national park.The crew pioneered the use of a 360 degree camera to record close-up images of gibbons swinging through the Malaysian jungle canopy.Mr Gunton said that his favourite sequences showed macaques in Kathmandu, the capital of Nepal, gleefully jumping into their own private monkey swimming pool. ""It's such surprising and playful behaviour,"" he said. ""It brings me joy every time I watch it. You don't have to anthropomorphise in the script; the animals do it so overtly.""Primates is narrated by the naturalist Chris Packham, who has been tipped as a long-term successor to Sir David Attenborough, 93. Mr Gunton said that the series was ""more easy access"" and ""not quite as majestic"" as Sir David's celebrated BBC landmarks, but praised Packham's presenting skills. The overall message of the programme, he added, is that humans need to give our closest cousins more space to thrive.""The environment in which they live is incredibly sensitive to our activities,"" he said. ""Of all the creatures on the planet, we seem to be affecting our own kin in a way we should be concerned about.""Primates begins on BBC One at 8.15pm on April 26. Tapanuli orangutans appear in episode two.Leading article, page 25 Exciting discovery ? The Tapanuli orangutan (Pongo tapanuliensis) is the third recognised species of orangutan. The others are the Bornean (Pongo pygmaeus) and the Sumatran (Pongo abelii).? Tapanuli are thought to have diverged from Sumatran orangutans about 3.4 million years ago and split from Bornean orangutans 674,000 years ago. They have been entirely isolated from other populations for about 20,000 years.? Tapanuli orangutans resemble Sumatran orangutans more than Bornean ones but have frizzier hair, smaller heads, and flatter faces. Both sexes have beards and dominant males have moustaches.? The Tapanuli orangutan is wary of human contact. They were first observed before 1939, then again in 1997, but not classified as a distinct species until 2017. This was the first new great ape species to be described since the bonobo in 1929, and its discovery brought the total number of great ape species to eight, including humans.? Just 800 Tapanuli orangutans remain in the Batang Toru forest, on the Indonesian island of Sumatra. They are split into three populations over a 420 square mile area.? They are threatened by plans to build a $1.6 billion hydroelectric power plant and dam in the region. Conservationists say the development will disrupt their habitat by requiring the construction of roads and other infrastructure, pushing the orangutans towards extinction. The species is rated as critically endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature.",Newspaper
395,Silence is not acceptable - ministers must tell us the plan,"April 18, 2020 Saturday",International,thetimes.co.uk,704,704,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,The Sunday Times,Silence is not acceptable - ministers must tell us the plan,"The coronavirus crisis has led the government to take measures many would have thought impossible in peacetime. Yet when ministers are asked how long this unusual period - this lockdown - will last and what their proposals are for getting out of it, their response is defensive, even shirty. That has to change.The government also needs to show some humility. Journalists have been criticised for asking ""political"" questions at the daily Downing Street press conferences, but that is because, with one or two exceptions, the politicians have been behaving like politicians. While the scientists can admit that the response in other countries has been more timely and effective, ministers find it hard to do so.This weekend, once again, they are getting the headlines they did not want: that frontline NHS staff are being put at risk by a lack of personal protective equipment (PPE). On Friday, Public Health England warned that ""in times of extreme shortages"" healthcare professionals may need to reuse gowns or resort to alternatives. PPE shortages, together with the crisis in care homes, is in danger of creating the impression of political leaders who are not in control of events.The government has been lucky that the public has responded so well to its lockdown message, with only a tiny minority infringing the guidance, given that its messaging before the lockdown had lacked clarity. People have been very grown up - more so than the government and behavioural scientists had expected.Now they need to be treated like adults. The idea that if ministers talk publicly about an exit strategy from the crisis it will dilute the lockdown message is an insult to our intelligence. People can understand the need for the lockdown to continue for a further three weeks, until the peak of the crisis has passed, to prevent NHS critical care from being overwhelmed. Indeed, the public would have reacted against any attempt to end the lockdown too early. There is a contrast here between Britain and some American states, where protesters are agitating for an immediate end to their lockdown.The people of Britain are sensible, but they also need hope. The strains of the lockdown on families are exacerbated by the absence of any word from the government on how it might end. The economy is also crying out for a plan. The Office for Budget Responsibility has sketched out a scenario in which the economy shrinks by 35% in the second quarter, unemployment rises by at least two million and the budget deficit hits more than £270bn this year. The Bank of England will soon provide a similarly gloomy assessment.An exit strategy not only gives people something to hope for but will also be important in containing the permanent economic scarring from this episode. Many businesses have taken advantage of the government's job retention scheme, which pays 80% of the wages of furloughed staff and which has been extended to the end of June. For firms uncertain of when they will be able to resume operations, the furlough, which is costing taxpayers tens of billions, may not be enough. Hence the worries about a big and sustained rise in unemployment lasting well beyond this summer.Today we report that the cabinet is considering a three-phase end to the lockdown. The first, starting next month, would see primary schools reopening, along with classes for pupils sitting GCSEs and A-levels next year. Some non-essential shops would reopen and some elective surgery in the NHS would resume.In the second phase, a few weeks later, more shops and other businesses would reopen, followed later in the summer by pubs and restaurants. The final phase - only after a vaccine has been developed and proved to work, probably next year - would release the vulnerable and the over-70s from the lockdown.It is a plan, the merits of which can be debated, but it is said to be awaiting the return to work of Boris Johnson, without whom big decisions are not being taken. That is wrong. We have a system of cabinet government, not a presidency or a dictatorship. Informing people and businesses of proposed next steps and preparing the ground cannot be determined by the length of the prime minister's convalescence. We have a right to know.",Web Publication
396,Stirling University team leads call for greater clarity on 'confusing' junk food adverts,"April 18, 2020 Saturday",International,thetimes.co.uk,618,618,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,Billy Briggs,Stirling University team leads call for greater clarity on 'confusing' junk food adverts,"Campaigners are calling for adverts for junk food and confectionery to carry French-style health warnings, after Scottish research found that marketing led up to a quarter of children to consider such products to be good for them.A new paper examining the influence that visual marketing for foods high in fat, salt and sugar has on children found that busy, entertaining adverts can make a brand appear healthy.In response, the National Obesity Forum called for the UK to adopt France's Nutri-score system, arguing it is ""quite superior"" to the traffic light food labelling used in the UK.A Stirling University-led team conducted a survey with 11-19 year-olds who were asked to watch 30-second video adverts for fast food and confectionery. The first advert was from McDonald's and depicted activities traditionally associated with the British summer time. These included people going to the beach and playing football in a park, a summer fair, and a music concert with footage of Little Mix performing.The second advert, from Haribo, was set on a busy commuter train with a group of adults sat around a table with a bag of Haribo Starmix.More than a quarter of the interviewees, 28%, thought that the advert made McDonald's seem a healthy choice, while one in ten also felt that way about Haribo.In France, all TV adverts for unhealthy foods must display one of four health messages and, from January 2021, it will become mandatory to include a Nutri-score graphic that provides an easy-to-read indication of nutritional content.The grading takes into account salt, sugar and fat content, as well as positive nutrients such as vitamins, to give a score from A to E, coloured from green to red. It is derived from the UK Food Standards Agency's nutrient profiling system.Stirling University's Dr Nathan Critchlow, a research fellow in the institute for social marketing, and an author of the report funded by Cancer Research UK, said: ""Advertising provides a great opportunity to communicate nutritional information to large numbers of people.""The Nutri-score approach in France is a good example of simple and clear presentation, and a similar 'traffic light' system is already used on some food packaging in the UK. Further research is required to explore the potential benefits of adopting this approach more widely - and, if supported by evidence, it could help inform the next stage of the UK government's childhood obesity strategy.""Tam Fry, of the National Obesity Forum, described the research as ""excellent"" and said the UK should have implemented Nutri-score over a decade ago.""A prototype of this French system, which is quite superior to the UK's voluntary traffic lights food labelling and is to be mandatory throughout mainland Europe, was spurned by the short-sighted Labour administration,"" said Fry.""Even in 2016, when Theresa May gave the green light to update the traffic lights in her abortive childhood obesity strategy, the UK failed to seize the opportunity radically to reform its product guidance. It is indicative of the current government's disinterest in obesity - whether it be children's or adult's - that no reform has even been mentioned in the last four years.""Professor Linda Bauld, a behavioural scientist who is Cancer Research UK's cancer prevention expert based at the University of Edinburgh, said: ""Eating a balanced diet is important to maintain a healthy weight and better nutritional labelling will help people make the most informed choices about what they eat.""Mandatory labelling on packaging that provides nutritional information in the most easy to understand way possible is a measure we support, but further research is needed on what this should look like.""",Web Publication

399,"Support for wearing face masks in public outweighs opposition;A survey of 1,500 people found that 41 per cent of respondents believed the public should be asked to wear masks","April 18, 2020 Saturday",International,telegraph.co.uk,791,791,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,"By Edward Malnick, Sunday Political Editor","Support for wearing face masks in public outweighs oppositionA survey of 1,500 people found that 41 per cent of respondents believed the public should be asked to wear masks","Support for wearing face coverings in public outweighs opposition, a poll has found, as a government adviser warned that more people could be put at risk of infection as a result of masks being worn incorrectly.A survey of 1,500 people found that 41 per cent of respondents believed the public should be asked to wear masks, or makeshift masks, now or at some point in the future, compared to 33 per cent who disagreed. Some 26 per cent said they did not know either way.The poll was conducted on Friday as ministers prepared todecide whether to issue official guidance asking the population to use masks or other face coverings to help reduce the spread of the virus in public places, following a review by the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), which is due to discuss the issue on Tuesday.But Susan Michie, who is advising the Government on how the population responds to its measures, said many people were already potentially exposing themselves and others to coronavirus by using masks improperly.Prof Michie, a professor of health psychology at University College London, also warned of a ""false reassurance"" that means that mask wearers could be ""much less likely"" to follow social distancing rules as well as guidance on handwashing and using tissues.Last week, Sadiq Khan, the Mayor of London, called for the compulsory use of masks during the Covid-19 pandemic. But the UK's current approach is in line with World Health Organisation recommendations, which suggest that the devices should only be worn by those taking care of people with Covid-19, or by patients with symptoms.Prof Michie suggested that the Government could recommend the use of masks by ""heavily exposed"" people such as shopkeepers and transport workers, rather than instructing their use by the population at large. One option under consideration is advising the use of masks on public transport.The poll, by Redfield & Wilson Strategies, also found that the idea of the Government requiring the public to wear masks made only a slight difference to fears held by respondents about leaving their homes when current lockdown measures are relaxed.Some 31 per cent of people said they would still feel unsafe leaving their homes if the lockdown ends on May 7-the date to which the current measures have been extended. That figure drops to 28 per cent when people are asked how they would feel about leaving their homes in such a scenario if the Government requires the public to wear masks.Meanwhile, 84 per cent of people said they would feel unsafe going to a restaurant or pub if they were able to do so after May 7, dropping to 81 per cent in the scenario that everyone was asked to wear a mask.Speaking to The Telegraph in a personal capacity, Prof Michie, who sits on the behavioural and communications subgroup of Sage, said the question of whether to encourage the use of masks by the population at large was ""very tricky"".Prof Michie said: ""Currently, there is no evidence that masks in community settings are helpful... The problem about the idea of wearing masks in a general community setting is human behaviour.""People touch their masks. They take them off and put them on, and when they speak to people, they take them off, which is exactly the time when you should have them on. When they take them off, they'll actually touch the mask, when you're just meant to [touch] the little bits around your ears.""Prof Michie warned that members of the public also tend to put masks down onto surfaces, which would be contaminated if they are infectious.She added: ""It's a great collector of viruses-a damp, warm place that can nicely collect them. The problem is that people often don't throw them away, they use them several times.""Prof Michie also warned that people feel ""very reassured by masks"" despite the fact they offer no protection against the virus entering a wearer's eyes.""Once there is false reassurance, people may be much less likely to pay attention to social distancing and to washing their hands, using a tissue, etc. The association between wearing it and feeling safe could arguably put people more at risk.""Prof Michie said the issues were being ""considered"" as part of the discussions about whether to issue instructions to the public on mask wearing.Yesterday, more than 100 doctors said they were ""alarmed at official inaction over the need for the public to wear homemade face masks.""Sir Patrick Vallance, the chief scientific adviser, has said the Government's position on masks will change if the scientific evidence warrants a shift. On Friday, Grant Shapps, the Transport Secretary, said: ""It looks like the advantages might be marginal-there can even be times when it's disadvantageous if they're not used properly.""",Newspaper; Web Publication
400,"As lockdown lingers, herd immunity rears its head again;Clash of strategies shows how relationship between scientists and politicians can be a complicated one","April 19, 2020",International,The Sunday Telegraph (London),1950,1950,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,Investigations,"As lockdown lingers, herd immunity rears its head againClash of strategies shows how relationship between scientists and politicians can be a complicated one","LOOKING back, it was a moment that Sir Patrick Vallance may now view as regrettable.As he articulated the Government's decision to pursue a policy of ""herd immunity"" to the television journalist interviewing him, the Chief Scientific Adviser stressed that it was only following ""the most up-to-date and relevant advice"" from the experts appointed to navigate a way through the unfolding coronavirus crisis.Herd immunity, he explained, would necessitate around 60 per cent of the country contracting the disease so that, once recovered, their acquired antibodies would effectively protect the rest of the population, too.It was put to him that with the virus having an estimated fatality rate of up to one per cent, that was potentially an awful lot of deaths to countenance.Sir Patrick couldn't deny it. ""That is a real prospect. This is a nasty disease.""Anyone with an elementary grasp of maths could have deduced that it might therefore cost the lives of hundreds of thousands of people.That interview was on March 13, a day after Sir Patrick, side by side with Boris Johnson, had first floated the idea of herd immunity at a press conference. The Prime Minister had also taken that opportunity to declare that people with mild symptoms should self-isolate for a week - but stopped short of calling for the cancelling of mass gatherings or closing schools.It has now emerged that for nearly a fortnight, the Government had been privy to scientific advice from Imperial College London, which had forecast mass casualties from the Covid-19 strain. Mathematical modelling of potential deaths had been made available as early as March 1, according to Prof Neil Ferguson, who led the team.Furthermore, on March 12, the date of the ""herd immunity"" press conference, Imperial had presented a further study to the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), which predicted a quarter of a million fatalities in the UK unless truly stringent measures were taken to suppress the virus.Yet here was Sir Patrick, a day later, insisting that a lengthy lockdown was unhelpful as it would only lead to a second, potentially larger, outbreak later. ""We want to … not suppress it so we get the second peak and also allow enough of us who are going to get mild illness to become immune to this to help with the sort of whole population response, which would protect everybody.""Sir Patrick may not have known it, but the ground was already shifting beneath him. According to insiders, a seismic change in thinking was taking place in the Government's inner circle.Seeing Imperial's numbers starkly on a page - 250,000 deaths unless we lock down the country - had apparently concentrated a few minds.The result was that, even as herd immunity was being expounded on national television, the very real prospect of abandoning its pursuit was now being actively considered in No10 - but it was still a full 11 days before Johnson announced the lockdown.That was nearly four weeks ago, and since then the line from the Government has been consistent: stay at home, only go out for essentials and keep the vulnerable isolated.For now, it seems, the country is on a single, straight, Imperial-sanctioned path - but questions remain. Why did it take so long? Is it the right path? And how do we go from here, in an unsustainable state of economic stasis, back to something resembling normality? The key to understanding the first of those questions lies in the structure of the committees set up to advise the Government in such times of crisis.Sage, and the three subcommittees that feed into it, comprise a range of scientists, the identities of whom are largely unknown, apparently in order to protect them from threats.This opaque nature, and the fact that they are dominated by epidemiologists, behavioural scientists and mathematical modellers, has led to criticism. Prof Anthony Costello, of University College's Institute for Global Health, says: ""I think that is quite a narrow view of science. You needed independent public health scientists, social health scientists, IT people, logisticians - and maybe citizen scientists - people that understand how you collect data on a large scale from communities and feed it back to them.""Until the pivotal Imperial report was acted upon, it had appeared to some that the Government was actually most in thrall to the behavioural scientists.One report, submitted to Sage on March 4, examined the potential public resistance to various interventions, such as school closures, and concluded they would be ""highly disruptive"" and ""likely to present an unequal burden to different sections of society"".Some committee members clearly felt it would cause ""discontent"" to isolate only vulnerable people. But others said explaining that the rest of the population was building herd immunity for them ""will make this acceptable"".This kind of advice, together with the naturally liberalist instincts of Mr Johnson, seems to have contributed to the delay in bringing in lockdown.Prof Costello says of the Prime Minister: ""He wants people to be pretty free. The thing that they didn't realise was that every week's delay … can be a disaster.""He points to other countries, such as Ireland, as examples of how more effective actions could have been taken earlier, as does Sir David King, the chief scientific adviser between 2000 and 2007.Sir David says that allowing the Cheltenham races in the second week of March, for instance, had been a clear error. His own son caught the coronavirus while attending the four-day festival, but has now recovered. ""I do know Patrick Vallance rather well and have enormous respect for him and think he's the right man in the right job. I cannot believe that Patrick, knowing what he knows about epidemics, would have said go ahead with Cheltenham.""I can't believe that that was the science advice. A big crowd of jostling people all trying to lay bets and collect money at the same time, it's just the formula for spread.""Sir David's perception is that, unlike when he advised and politicians listened, now it is more the other way round with advisers kept on a tight rein. And having worked with Mr Johnson when he was London mayor, he says: ""It was very clear that he does want people to like him and he certainly showed that he enjoyed listening to what I had to say, but I became aware that the next person walking into his office who said the opposite to me would get the same treatment.""Having finally opted for lockdown, the Government is now being accused by some academics of having swallowed the Imperial study too readily. Prof Richard Sullivan, co-director of the conflict and health research group at King's College, London, says: ""They went from almost nothing … to the full lockdown, just like that.""He has argued for the modelling to include the unintended consequences of the lockdown on public health, but says his pleas have been ignored.""And so, as politicians they panicked and they went for the extreme lockdown because they were told it's the only thing that's going to save the NHS.The problem, he adds, is that ""the modelling community in infectious diseases is a very closed and very small community. So if you get it wrong, you can't see you've got it wrong.""Whether Prof Ferguson has got it wrong on Covid-19 remains to be seen, but certainly some of his past pronouncements over pandemics have appeared to fall well wide of the mark. His research that sparked the mass culling of farm animals during the 2001 epidemic of foot-and-mouth disease was disputed. In 2002 Prof Ferguson got involved in the BSE crisis, which had years earlier seen John Gummer, the then agriculture minister, attempt to reassure the public that it was safe to eat beef by feeding a hamburger to his four-year-old daughter.Prof Ferguson authored a report speculating that BSE in cows and sheep could cause up to 150,000 human deaths: to date it is fewer than 200.Three years later he aired the possibility of bird flu leading to 200million deaths and then said in 2009 that swine flu could kill up to 4million. The sum total of the death toll for both diseases was in fact much lower.Prof Ferguson, however, stands by the integrity of his modelling. Now the Government is also facing pressure over its insistence that the use of face masks for everyday use by the general public is unnecessary.The official line has been that unless you are in close contact with someone, a mask will not make much difference.But the Government is now considering revising its stance, following a prediction from David Nabarro, the World Health Organisation special envoy on Covid-19, that they could play a role in our exit from the lockdown.He says: ""I'm envisaging that as people start trying to get back to what I call the new normal - the Covid-ready normal - they will be wanting to wear face protection."" He says that after the Sars outbreak in Asia, ""people used to tell me, one of the reasons they wear masks is they want to do everything possible to keep safe. The second is to show to others that they're taking it seriously.""For the exit strategy, we should definitely not rely solely on the mathematical modellers, says Robert Dingwall, professor of social sciences at Nottingham Trent University, and an adviser to one of the Sage subcommittees.""There is a space in the policymaking that might be occupied by a combination of sociologists, political scientists and historians who have worked on previous pandemics.""Modellers are smart people but they're mathematicians primarily and that's why you need to set their advice into a social and economic context.""Ferguson, for example, keeps talking about social distancing as a kind of all-or-nothing thing. There isn't going to be a VE day where we declare it's all over.""One problem, he says, is that ""the Government has ramped up the level of fear to a point where it's very hard for people to hear the messages about 'this is the way out'.""He describes the lockdown on parks, for instance, as ""cruel and unjust"", adding: ""It's a policy by people like me who live in houses with big gardens.""Now, it's our view that the fear is out of all proportion to the threat and the risk. There's been a real perspective loss here. I keep saying to people we have as many if not more people dying of pneumonia and loads of other conditions. I think life has to start renormalising again with sufficient care and attention to the vulnerable.""In addition to the search for a vaccine, comprehensive testing of the population so that infected people - and anyone they have had contact with - can remain in isolation, will also be essential. But with the Government struggling to reach its projected target for the end of the month of 100,000 tests a day, that goal feels a long way off, as does a vaccine.According to some scientists, the only other option might involve us coming full circle.Prof Sullivan says that, even after sorting out testing and the provision of adequate personal protection equipment, ""Are we going to wait for two years for a vaccine which may never happen? ""Of course not. The British economy and society will be finished by then. So, your only option here is about building up herd immunity.""After all this, herd immunity? But then, as Prof Chris Whitty, the Chief Medical Officer, told the media last week, ""The thing about scientific advice is that it evolves.""Perhaps Sir Patrick won't find he has anything to regret after all.'As politicians they panicked and they went for the extreme lockdown because they were told it's the only thing that's going to save the NHS''I cannot believe that Patrick, knowing what he knows about epidemics, would have said go ahead with Cheltenham'",Newspaper

On testing, contact tracing and equipment supply, there was a failure to prepare Coronavirus - latest updatesSee all our coronavirus coverage","By late December last year, doctors in the central Chinese city of Wuhanwere starting to worry about patients quarantined in their hospitals suffering from an unusual type of pneumonia.As the mystery illness spread in one of China's major industrial hubs, some tried to warn their colleagues to take extra care at work, because the disease resembled Sars (severe acute respiratory syndrome), the deadly respiratory disease that had killed hundreds of people across the region in 2002-03after a government cover-up.One of those who tried to raise the alarm, though only among a few medical school classmates, was a 33-year-old Chinese ophthalmologist, Li Wenliang. Seven people were in isolation at his hospital, he said, and the disease appeared to be a coronavirus, from the same family as Sars.In early January he was called in by police, reprimanded for ""spreading rumours online"", and forced to sign a paper acknowledging his ""misdemeanour"" and promising not to repeat it.Many early cases were linked to the city's Huanan seafood and fresh produce market, which also sold wildlife, suggesting that the first cases were contracted there.Scientists would discover the disease had probably originated in bats and had then passed through a second species - in all likelihood, but not certainly, pangolins, a type of scaly anteater - before infecting humans.But the infections were soon spreading directly between patients, so fast that on 23 January the government announced an unprecedented lockdown of Wuhan city and the surrounding Hubei province.Two weeks later, on 7 February, Li, who had contracted coronavirus himself, died in hospital from the condition about which he had tried to raise the alarm. He had no known underlying conditions and left behind a wife and young child.Li became the face of the mysterious new disease. The story of his death and pictures of him in a hospital bed wearing an oxygen mask made media headlines across the globe, including in the UK.The world, it seemed, was slowly becoming more aware of how lethal coronavirus could be, that it was not just another form of fluwith fairly mild symptoms.But while UK scientists and medical researchers were becoming more concerned, and studying the evidence from China, those among them who were most worried were not getting their messages through to high places.                     Distracted by Brexit and reshuffles                   The Conservative government of Boris Johnson had other more immediate preoccupations at the start of this year.Johnson was still basking in his general election success last December. After he returned from a celebratory Caribbean holiday with his fiancee, Carrie Symonds, the political weather for the prime minister seemed to be set fair. It was honeymoon time.Three and a half years on from the Brexit referendum, the UK was finally about to leave the EU on 31 January. The fireworks and parties for the big night were being planned, the celebratory 50p coins minted.Minds were certainly not on a developing health emergency far away, as Johnson prepared to exploit the moment of the UK's departure from the European Union for all it was worth. ""I think there was some over-confidence,"" admitted one very senior Tory last week.The prime minister and his chief adviser, Dominic Cummings, wanted to make an early impression at home in other ways too, as domestic reformers. Cummings was waging a war on civil servants in Whitehall, throwing his weight around and deliberately upsetting the Westminster applecart.While he made the headlines, briefing about his iconoclastic ambitions, Johnson was preparing a big Cabinet reshuffle to assert his own authority in other areas now Brexit was done and dusted.With Labour effectively leaderless after its fourth consecutive election defeat, there was little opposition to trouble Johnson on any front at all - and certainly no-one of note asking tough questions about coronavirus.The prime minister duly recast his cabinet team on 13 February - five days after Li's death in Wuhan. He made big changes but unsurprisingly retained the hitherto safe pair of hands of Matt Hancock as his health secretary.In a sign of where priorities lay - and the lack of concern that a potential crisis might be heading our way from the east - Hancock wasted no time recording a video of himself grinning with delight on reshuffle day.He smacked his right fist into his left palm saying he could not wait to ""get cracking"" and that he relished the chance to deliver the Tories' manifesto promises, reform social care and improve life sciences. And lastly, in a more sombre voice, he spoke of ""dealing with coronavirus and keeping the public safe"" before adding, as the grin returned: ""Now let's get back to work!""It is perhaps too early to conclude for sure that Johnson, Hancock and the government's entire team of scientific and medical advisers were caught asleep at the wheel. But the fact that Johnson and Hancock themselves, in common with much of the Downing Street staff, would go on to contract the virus or suffer symptoms, further suggests that people at the top had not been sufficiently on their guard.Now, 11 weeks on from the first cases being confirmed in the UK on 31 January - a period during which more than 14,000 people (and probably several thousands more once care home fatalities are counted) in the UK have died from Covid-19 - and with the country in lockdown, the economy facing prolonged recession as a result, schools closed, and no sign of an end in sight - hard questions have to be asked.We already know with some certainty that other countries, such as Germany, South Korea, Taiwan and New Zealand, will emerge from this crisis having performed far better than the UK. A few weeks ago the government's advisers crassly said that fewer than 20,000 deaths would be ""a very good result"" for the UK.As we fast approach that grim tally, many experts now believe the UK may come out of this crisis, whenever that may be, with one of the worst records on fighting coronavirus of any European nation. Once the full tally is counted, few expect the number of deaths to be below 20,000.By contrast, on Friday, Germany was saying it thought it had brought coronavirus largely under control. It had had 3,868 deaths, less a third of the total in the UK (and Germany's population, at 83 million, is far higher), having conducted widespread testing for Covid-19 from early on, precisely as the UK has failed to do.How, then, did it come to this? How did coronavirus spread across the globe, prompting different responses in different countries? Did the UK simply fail to heed the warnings? Or did it just decide to take different decisions, while others settled on alternative actions to save lives?                     The warnings grow louder                   David Nabarro, professor of global health at Imperial College, London, and an envoy for the World Health Organization on Covid-19, says one thing is for sure. All governments were warned how serious the situation was likely to become as early as the end of January. Ignorance of the danger that was coming can be no excuse. Yet it would not be until late March - later than many other countries - that Johnson would announce a complete lockdown.""WHO had been following the outbreak since the end of December and within a few weeks it called a meeting of its emergency committee to decide if this outbreak was a 'public health emergency of international concern',"" said Nabarro.""That is the highest level of alert that WHO can issue, and it issued it on January 30. It made it very clear then - to every country in the world - that we were facing something very serious indeed.""Well before the end of January, the WHO had been tracking the growing threat minutely: 14 January was a key day in the spread of the disease that would become known as Covid-19. The first case was confirmed outside China, with a woman hospitalised in Thailand.A WHO official warned then that it was possible that human-to-human transmission had occurred in families of victims - a sign that the disease had potential to spread far and fast - and, inside China, officials were quietly            told to prepare for a pandemic.There was little international attention on the day, though, because Beijing's dire warnings about a pandemic were made in secret, and a WHO spokesman rowed back from his colleague's claim.Officially, China had not seen a new case of the coronavirus for over a week; the outbreak appeared to be fading. It took another six days for China to publicly acknowledge the gravity of the threat, time that scientists believed meant a further 3,000 people were infected.But on 20 January, officials announced more than 100 new cases and admitted the virus was spreading between humans, a red flag for concern to anyone who works on infectious diseases. The virus could no longer be contained by finding the animal source of the infection and destroying it.Two days later, the scale of the challenge was made clear to the general public when Beijing locked down millions of people. All transport into and out of the metropolis of Wuhan was cut off, an unprecedented modern quarantine that would come at huge human and economic cost.On 29 January, the UK would have its first two confirmed cases of the disease. There was little sense that China's dilemma and its approach - shut down life as we know it or watch the death toll spiral out of control - might have to be our nightmare within weeks.In early February, Donald Trump announced a ban on travellers who had passed through China in the previous 14 days. Europe began focused testing of people with symptoms and travel histories that linked them to the disease, but little else.Johnson, it seemed, still had Brexit and free trade much more on his mind. Any hint of draconian action to fight coronavirus that might hurt the economy was the last thing he was entertaining.In a speech on Brexit in Greenwich on 3 February, he made clear his views on Wuhan-style lockdowns. ""We are starting to hear some bizarre autarkic rhetoric,"" he said, ""when barriers are going up, and when there is a risk that new diseases such as coronavirus will trigger a panic and a desire for market segregation that go beyond what is medically rational to the point of doing real and unnecessary economic damage.""Then, at that moment, humanity needs some government somewhere that is willing at least to make the case powerfully for freedom of exchange, some country ready to take off its Clark Kent spectacles and leap into the phone booth and emerge with its cloak flowing as the supercharged champion of the right of the populations of the Earth to buy and sell freely among each other.""                     'Herd immunity': UK goes it alone                   By early March it was abundantly clear to many academics and scientists that the approach being adopted by the UK was markedly different from those followed by other countries. From South Korea to Germany, governments had invested heavily in expanding testing capacity from the first weeks of the epidemic.Hong Kong, Taiwan and Singapore had brought in controls on travellers from infected regions and strict contact tracing to help understand who could have been exposed, inform them and require self isolation. Face masks became widespread in east Asia, long before it was recommended elsewhere.Testing and contact tracing has been at the heart of the approach advocated by the WHO, so that countries can establish how transmission chains were occurring, in order to break them.Many also brought in some social distancing measures, banning large gatherings, closing schools or extending holidays, and encouraged those who could do to work from home. None were as extreme as China's shutdown, or the European and American lockdowns that would follow.Writing in the Observer last month, Devi Sridhar, chair of global public health at the University of Ediburgh, noted the distinct UK approach. ""Rather than learning from other countries and following the WHO advice, which comes from experts with decades of experience in tackling outbreaks across the world, the UK has decided to follow its own path. This seems to accept that the virus is unstoppable and will probably become an annual, seasonal infection.""The plan, as explained by the chief science adviser, is to work towards 'herd immunity', which is to have the majority of the population contract the virus, develop antibodies and then become immune to it. This theory has been widely used to advocate for mass vaccination for measles, mumps and rubella. The thinking is that, if most of the population is vaccinated, a small percentage can go unvaccinated without cases emerging.""It was not just the UK whose politicians and scientific advisers were, arguably, slow to act in the early stages. Others countries, including Spain and France, were caught out too, but it was Italy's tragedy that alerted Europe to the scale of the threat it faced.European governments and citizens were forced to reckon with the reality that in an age of global travel, the thousands of miles separating them from China meant almost nothing at all. Thousands of Britons were holidaying in Italy the week that it shut down. They were advised to go into self-quarantine on return, but were not registered by the health authorities, nor were their contacts tracked.Italy and the UK had both had had their first case a day apart at the end of January, but cases rose faster in Italy. The country may just have been unlucky that carriers of the disease flew to its northern cities and ski resorts rather than to other European capitals.Whatever the reason, cases and then deaths started climbing sharply in northern Italy in late February. Dozens of towns were locked down from the 21st, but in the rest of the country life carried on as normal.It was soon clear that the problem had not been contained. On 8 March, the prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, quarantined 16 million people across the north of the country, and the next day extended the lockdown to all of Italy.The measures saved lives, but came too late for thousands of Italians. The death toll outstripped China, and the world looked on horrified as hospitals were overwhelmed, doctors forced to choose who should have a chance on a ventilator and who should die. On 11 March, the WHO declared a global pandemic. On 14 March, Spain went into lockdown, and three days later France did the same.But in the UK there appeared to be greater reluctance to act decisively with lockdowns: the banning of mass gatherings and the closure of pubs and restaurants. The government's scientific and behavioural science advisers were warning ministers that the public might react badly to draconian measures and would not tolerate them for long.In an apparent show of defiance against the lockdowners, Johnson and Symonds attended the England v Wales rugby match at Twickenham on 7 March. The Cheltenham Festival, attended over three days to 13 March by 250,000 racegoers, was allowed to go ahead.                     Shutdown: Johnson changes tack                   The tone was about to change. In a Downing Street press conference on 12 March, Johnson, who had said a few days before the first UK death that the disease was ""likely to spread a bit more"" suddenly became the deliverer of grave warnings.Previous talk by his advisers of avoiding lockdowns and developing ""herd immunity"" had been banished and replaced by a brutal honesty. ""I must level with you,"" Johnson told reporters. ""More families, many more families, are going to lose loved ones before their time."" On 18 March - just days after Downing Street had suggested it was not on the cards - the government announced the closure of all schools until further noticed. Pubs and restaurants were ordered to shut on 20 March. The UK had come late into line.One former cabinet minister last week described the change of approach as a ""screeching U-turn"". Johnson and his ministers were now, even more than before, taking cover behind, and advice from, their scientific and medical advisers. Many of these advisers had become increasingly concerned that the UK had become out of step with other countries because of political resistance from ministers to measures that would hit the economy. The Observer has been told that at least two senior government advisers were on the brink of of quitting before Johnson switched his approach.The government has found itself unable to escape the consequences of a wider failure to prepare. As hospitals threatened to be overwhelmed before orders were given to massively expand capacity, ministers came under intense criticism over the lack of protective equipment for frontline NHS staff, over the lack of ventilators for patients in intensive care, and for a failure to test more widely for Covid-19, particularly among NHS workers.The lack of preparedness and instances of chaotic planning has shocked many in and outside the NHS.Last week, Dr Alison Pittard, the dean of the Faculty of Intensive Care Medicine, the professional body for intensive care practitioners, said the minimum specifications for the government's own homegrown ventilator scheme would produce machines that would only treat patients ""for a few hours"". ""If we had been told that that was the case... we'd have said: 'Don't bother, you're wasting your time. That's of no use',"" she told the Financial Times.Last month the government missed an EU procurement deadline for ventilators because, minister said, an email went unnoticed. The NHS had said 30,000 more would be needed, Hancock reduced this to 18,000. Pittard said her faculty had been warning for years about a shortage of intensive care capacity and intensive care nurses in hospitals.Normally each intensive care patient would have one intensive care nurse in attendance all the time, she said. Now there was one nurse to six patients, although other staff had been redeployed to intensive care units to plug the gaps and the new system was working because of heroic efforts. Although she was reluctant to criticise the government, she said that if the faculty had been listened to, ""we wouldn't be starting from this place"". Germany, she pointed out, has 29 intensive care beds per 100,000 people, compared with six in the UK.The Tory MP and former health minister Dan Poulter, who works part-time in the NHS, said that given the enormity of the challenge facing government ""it almost seems wrong to be critical"".But he believes part of the problem is that insufficient advice has been sought from experienced NHS clinicians who would have warned of problems with PPE early on, of the shortage of ventilators and would have told ministers of the urgent need to test NHS staff.""An early over-reliance on academic modelling also resulted in a lack of experienced frontline NHS clinicians - in other words, the people who really understand the day-to-day challenges our hospitals and health service face - from feeding into the initial Covid-19 action plan,"" he said. ""This has manifested itself amongst other things in the slowness of providing adequate PPE for frontline NHS staff and in the lack of virus testing for healthcare staff in the earlier part of the outbreak.""                     How the scientists reacted                   When the investigations into the UK's response to Covid-19 come to be written, there is widespread recognition among experts that this lack of long-term strategic planning will be at the centre of it. So too should be the need to ensure that the views of experts are fed into government more efficiently and widely. The prospect of a previously unknown disease spreading catastrophically around the globe and infecting millions is, after all, not a new one.Indeed, many warnings have been given in the past about the viral dangers facing humanity. ""Given the continual emergence of new pathogens ... and the ever-increasing connectedness of our world, there is a significant probability that a large and lethal pandemic will occur in our lifetime,"" Bill Gates predicted several years ago. ""And it will have the impact of a nuclear war,"" he warned, while urging nations to start stockpiling antiviral drugs and therapies. If only.For its part, the WHO prepared - several years ago - a list of viruses with no known treatments or vaccines, illnesses that could one day trigger that pandemic and kill hundreds of thousands. Prospective killers included nipah disease and lassa fever as well as an ailment it simply called ""disease X"" - ""a serious international epidemic caused by a pathogen currently unknown"".As to the most likely nature of that mysterious virus, most modelling assumed that disease X would be flu-like in behaviour, says Dr Josie Golding, the epidemics lead at the Wellcome Trust. After all, influenza had caused so many deadly global outbreaks in the past. As a result, a lot of investment went into making influenza vaccines in preparation, she says. ""But have we been thinking about diseases other than influenza that might become pandemics? I don't think we have. There has been a real gap in our thinking.""Then came the appearance of Covid-19 - caused not by a strain of influenza but by a coronavirus - in November. Initially, only a few cases were highlighted, a trend that began to change early this year with a rise in numbers of infected ill people.""The report that really grabbed my attention came out in mid-January,"" says epidemiologist Professor Mark Woolhouse at Edinburgh University. ""It said 41 cases of this new respiratory illness had now been diagnosed in one small area of China, around Wuhan. And that set the alarm bells ringing for me.""For Woolhouse, the cluster of cases in one place showed this was not a matter of a few people scattered around China picking up an occasional infection from an animal such as a bat or a chicken. ""Forty-one cases in one small area at the same time could not be explained that way. People are not picking this up from animals, I realised. They are actually spreading it to each other. It was already heading out of control.""Ewan Birney, head of the Cambridgeshire-based European Bioinformatics Institute, part of the European Molecular Biology Laboratory network, also noted the significance of the new disease at the time. ""I presumed, at first, that this one would also burn itself out, probably somewhere in Asia,"" he says.His reasoning was straightforward. The outbreak of Sars that appeared in 2003 in China was caused by a coronavirus and killed more than 10% of those it infected. ""In fact, it killed or hospitalised so many of those it infected the chain of transmission from one person to others was cut. It was too lethal for its own good. So I thought this might happen with this new disease. But it turns out Covid-19 is much milder and incapacitates fewer individuals, so there is no cut in its transmission. When that became apparent - around mid-January - I became very worried.""Then there was the infectiousness of the new virus. A person with Sars generally starts to display symptoms before they infect other people. That makes it much easier to contain. But this was not the case with Covid-19. Early data from China - again released in January - showed the virus was being spread from people who were displaying only the mildest symptoms, or in some cases no symptoms. This was making the condition very difficult to track, says virologist Professor Jonathan Ball of Nottingham University.""At that point I realised this outbreak was going to be very serious,"" he added. ""I sent a tweet to a colleague in Australia. It simply said: 'This one is out of the bag properly'. He sent one back agreeing with me.""Around this time, Paul Nurse, Nobel laureate and head of the Francis Crick Institute, recalls attending a conference where he met Mark Walport, head of UK Research and Innovation, the organisation that funds a vast slice of British scientific research.""He had just received a text message from a colleague about the outbreak and we started to discuss the implications,"" Nurse recalls. ""It did not take us long for us both to realise this was going to be very significant. It took another two or three weeks to confirm these worst fears - by mid-February.""By this time, Birney had realised the virus had a real sting in its tail and could cause serious illness among the elderly and those with other underlying serious ailments. ""It was half-term and I was on holiday with my parents. All I wanted to do was to get the holiday over and then get them back to their house in the country where they could keep themselves isolated.""In February, sporadic cases of Covid-19 were appearing round the country, recalls Tom Wingfield, a clinician and infectious disease expert based at the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine. ""These were cases that had been brought into the country, mainly from China or Italy. Then there was an outbreak in Brighton [and a number of other cases without foreign travel] and I realised that the virus had established itself in a community there. It was a turning point.""Britain was still doing quite well in containing the disease by testing, tracing contact and setting up quarantine for those suspected of being infected with Covid-19 at this time. ""Then, in March, the government decided to abandon this approach and shift from containing the disease to delaying its progress,"" says Wingfield. ""I would really like to know why the decision to give up testing and contact tracing was taken.""Many other researchers also question why the government took so long to react to their warnings. ""Part of the trouble was there were other virologists who were saying this was going to be like Sars or flu and there was not too much to worry about,"" says Ball. ""But Sars happened in 2003. The world is much more connected now than it was then. More to the point, Covid-19 was also much more infectious than Sars. And so it started appearing in lots of other countries.""Perhaps some of us should have got up in front of BBC News and said you lot ought to be petrified because this is going to be a pandemic that will kill hundreds of thousands of people,"" adds Ball. ""None of us thought this was a particularly constructive thing to do, but maybe with hindsight we should have. If there had been more voices, maybe politicians would have taken this a bit more seriously.""""There is no question that we were insufficiently prepared,"" Nurse says. ""We had been warned a few years ago when reports made it clear that the UK was not ready to combat a major flu pandemic and we did not take up that warning. As a result, we were caught out.""He and many others say an inquiry into Britain's Covid-19 preparedness will have to be held at some point but stress that this should not be started until the crisis has been dealt with in the UK.Professor Ian Boyd, a former chief scientific adviser at the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, agrees. ""There is a great danger there will be a lot of looking back with the benefits of hindsight and poking fingers of blame,"" warns Boyd. ""But when you are in the middle of things you have to make a lot of very hard 50-50 decisions, and sometimes you make the wrong call. On the other hand, there is no harm in making sure that we learn as many lessons as we can.""                     The lessons from the rest of the world ...                   Boris Johnson, after his own brush with death at the hands of Covid-19, will presumably no longer take the gung-ho attitude to illness that he has always has. A former Tory minister said: ""If Boris had any sense he would take control of the inquiry and lead it.""One conclusion that experts are already drawing is that it was those countries close to China, with memories of Sars, or cultural ties to their neighbour, which were much faster to act in response to Covid-19. Perhaps most notable in its success was Taiwan. Closely linked by economic and cultural ties to mainland China, Taiwan could have been at high risk of a major Covid-19 epidemic. Tourists and business people travelled regularly back and forth.But helped perhaps by having an epidemiologist as vice-president, the government set up a gold standard regime of testing and contact tracing that means that nearly three months on from its first confirmed infection, it has registered fewer than 400 cases and six deaths.Taiwan's extensive testing and thorough contact tracing are precisely the kind of action that the former health secretary Jeremy Hunt is demanding before the UK lockdown is lifted. Hunt points out that it is one of the essential conditions set by the WHO to avoid a second wave resulting from an easing of restrictions.Hong Kong, which also suffered from the Sars crisis, also moved early to enforce quarantine and social distancing, as well as widespread mask wearing, and today has registered just over 1,000 cases and only four deaths.In late February, South Korea looked like it was on a trajectory to disaster, with the highest number of confirmed cases outside China, and numbers rising rapidly. But after the country's first infection, the government met medical companies and urged them to start developing coronavirus test kits on a massive scale.The results were impressive. When the epidemic hit, it was ready to deploy largescale testing. Its measures allowed South Korea to become the second country to flatten its coronavirus curve, without the sweeping shutdowns of society and economic activity that China had pioneered and the west would be forced to adopt.China's experience should have provided a grim template for western countries to use to prepare. The speed with which Wuhan's crisis had intensified showed that a relatively advanced medical system could be swamped. Within three weeks there were over 64,000 people infected and 1,000 dead.The pleas for help from Wuhan's residents and doctors were to be echoed by those from Italy a few weeks later, and soon after the UK.Look back three months, and in China there were not enough tests to work out who had coronavirus, there was not enough protective equipment for medical staff treating patients, and then, soon, tragically there were not enough hospital beds and ventilators for sick patients. These are exactly the challenges faced by authorities from New York to Rome, London to Madrid.                     ... and the other country that didn't listen                   If the UK has serious questions to answer, the country that so far has seen the worst of the outbreak, the United States, was slowest of all to act. Trump for months ignored, played down or lied about the threat posed by coronavirus, leaving individual states to act unilaterally as it became clear it had already taken hold on US soil.On 17 March parts of California issued ""shelter in place"" orders, effectively a lockdown. By the end of that week New York City had also shut down, along with a dozen states, and the majority of the rest of the country had put some restrictions in place. Only five states had few or no controls.There have now been nearly 700,000 confirmed cases in the US and over 33,000 deaths; actual numbers are likely to be higher for both. The economy has also been devastated, with more than 22 million out of work as businesses collapse or shrink under the strain.Trump insists the US is turning a corner, and has tried to blame - among other targets - the WHO for failing to fully raise the alarm, and has stripped it of its US funding.There have certainly been questions about the organisation's strong praise for China and the exclusion of Taiwan, which may have contributed to the delay in recognising human-to-human transmission was occurring. But it began daily briefings on 22 January and had declared aglobal health emergency by the end of that month.While initially sceptical about China's distancing measures, it urged other countries to adopt them once there was evidence they were working. It warned about shortages of PPE over a month ago, and since the beginning of the outbreak has urged countries, including the UK, to ""test, test, test"" to contain the virus - a strategy followed by almost all countries that have managed to suppress it.A senior Whitehall source with detailed knowledge of the UK's response and those of other countries said: ""The fact is that those countries who knew a lot about Sars quickly saw the danger. But in the UK the attitude among politicians and also scientists was that it was really just some form of a flu. All the government's pandemic planning was based on a flu scenario. And then it turned out to be something different and far, far worse and the response was completely...",Newspaper

405,"Coronavirus in Scotland: Doubts over 'test, trace and isolate' approach","April 19, 2020 Sunday",International,thetimes.co.uk,781,781,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,Mark McLaughlin,"Coronavirus in Scotland: Doubts over 'test, trace and isolate' approach","Plans to test, trace and isolate everyone infected with the coronavirus after lockdown will not slow its spread, a leading Scottish virologist has warned, amid claims that prolonged social distancing is key to minimising infections.Derek Gatherer, a lecturer in pandemics and infectious disease at Lancaster University, said that it was difficult to contain a virus that spread through coughing and did not show symptoms for about a week.Test, trace and isolate has been hailed as key weapon in containing the virus in east Asian countries such as South Korea, Hong Kong and Taiwan but these had the advantage of catching carriers early owing to proximity to China.By the time the virus spread to western Europe it had infiltrated big cities, quickly overwhelming the public health authorities' limited capacity to contact-trace.Hopes that a vaccine will come soon or that the population will acquire ""herd immunity"" after infection and recovery, were dealt another blow by a leading vaccinologist, who said that both remained distant prospects.If all three strategies fail the options will narrow to finding drugs to treat the symptoms of Covid-19, particularly the lung inflammation and pneumonia.Jason Leitch, the Scottish government's national clinical director, acknowledged that the outlook was bleak but said he had ""hope that science will get us out other end of this"".Dr Gatherer told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation: ""One thing we have learnt over the past few months is that Covid-19 isn't really containable. There were at the beginning some hopes that it might be containable in China and by the middle of February it looked as if there was an equal chance it could be contained.""But events have shown that it can't be and it subsequently spread across the whole world. It is always easy to say things in retrospect - we probably were a little ambitious in thinking that we could contain a respiratory virus like this one.""The traditional public health test, trace and isolate strategy is something that is very difficult to apply to a respiratory virus of this kind, because you have very limited time to get to the contacts, even if you can identify them, and with a virus like Covid-19 probably most of the contacts are non-identifiable.""I'm a bit sceptical that the test, trace, isolate technique will help in this case. I think we will just have to accept that the virus is very difficult to control, and it is just hygiene and social distancing to try to minimise the amount of spread.""This thing is not going to be controllable and we will have to try and slow it down as much as we can while we either wait for a vaccine to be developed, which still unfortunately looks quite a way off, or we gradually ease ourselves towards herd immunity, which isn't going to be a very comfortable process because there will be many more people infected, and unfortunately many more people will also die.""Dr Gatherer was sceptical about reports that some people in South Korea had caught the virus twice, insisting the initial test that gave them the all-clear was probably a false negative. He said: ""Probably reinfection is not something that would occur, unless you were exposed to high dose of the virus and you had no acquired immunity from your first encounter, and both of those things are fairly unlikely.""However, Sarah Gilbert, a vaccinologist at Oxford University, said there was little evidence of natural acquired immunity from Covid-19. She told the BBC's                    Andrew Marr Show                   : ""The coronavirus is very good at not leaving a very strong immune memory behind it. That is why people get reinfected.""Professor Gilbert is working on a vaccine derived from adenovirus, which also causes respiratory symptoms. She hopes that this will trigger a lasting immune response to Covid-19 but added: ""Nobody can be absolutely sure it is possible. That is why we have to do trials and we have to find out. We think the prospects are very good, but it is clearly not completely certain.""Professor Leitch confirmed that test, trace and isolate remained part of the Scottish government strategy, alongside continuing social distancing, in line with advice from the World Health Organisation.At a briefing in Edinburgh today he said: ""I have sympathy with the lack of optimism during a pandemic. I don't think it's a time of particular optimism. People are dying, people are suffering, families are grieving. But what I do have, if you will forgive me, is hope that science, the behavioural science and the work of thousands, will get us out the other end of this.""The reason I have hope is that we are learning more about this all the time.""",Newspaper; Web Publication
406,Call for clarity on junk food ads;Experts from Stirling University recommend French-style ratings after finding that commercials can confuse children,"April 19, 2020 Sunday",International,The Sunday Times (London),615,615,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,Billy Briggs,Call for clarity on junk food adsExperts from Stirling University recommend French-style ratings after finding that commercials can confuse children,"Campaigners are calling for adverts for junk food and confectionery to carry French-style health warnings, after Scottish research found that marketing led up to a quarter of children to consider such products to be good for them.A new paper examining the influence that visual marketing for foods high in fat, salt and sugar has on children found that busy, entertaining adverts can make a brand appear healthy.In response, the National Obesity Forum called for the UK to adopt France's Nutri-score system, arguing it is ""quite superior"" to the traffic light food labelling used in the UK.A Stirling University-led team conducted a survey with 11-19 year-olds who were asked to watch 30-second video adverts for fast food and confectionery. The first advert was from McDonald's and depicted activities traditionally associated with the British summer time. These included people going to the beach and playing football in a park, a summer fair, and a music concert with footage of Little Mix performing.The second advert, from Haribo, was set on a busy commuter train with a group of adults sat around a table with a bag of Haribo Starmix.More than a quarter of the interviewees, 28%, thought that the advert made McDonald's seem a healthy choice, while one in ten also felt that way about Haribo.In France, all TV adverts for unhealthy foods must display one of four health messages and, from January 2021, it will become mandatory to include a Nutriscore graphic that provides an easy-toread indication of nutritional content.The grading takes into account salt, sugar and fat content, as well as positive nutrients such as vitamins, to give a score from A to E, coloured from green to red. It is derived from the UK Food Standards Agency's nutrient profiling system.Stirling University's Dr Nathan Critchlow, a research fellow in the institute for social marketing, and an author of the report funded by Cancer Research UK, said: ""Advertising provides a great opportunity to communicate nutritional information to large numbers of people.""The Nutri-score approach in France is a good example of simple and clear presentation, and a similar 'traffic light' system is already used on some food packaging in the UK. Further research is required to explore the potential benefits of adopting this approach more widely - and, if supported by evidence, it could help inform the next stage of the UK government's childhood obesity strategy."" Tam Fry, of the National Obesity Forum, described the research as ""excellent"" and said the UK should have implemented Nutri-score over a decade ago.""A prototype of this French system, which is quite superior to the UK's voluntary traffic lights food labelling and is to be mandatory throughout mainland Europe, was spurned by the shortsighted Labour administration,"" said Fry. ""Even in 2016, when Theresa May gave the green light to update the traffic lights in her abortive childhood obesity strategy, the UK failed to seize the opportunity radically to reform its product guidance. It is indicative of the current government's disinterest in obesity - whether it be children's or adult's - that no reform has even been mentioned in the last four years.""Professor Linda Bauld, a behavioural scientist who is Cancer Research UK's cancer prevention expert based at the University of Edinburgh, said: ""Eating a balanced diet is important to maintain a healthy weight and better nutritional labelling will help people make the most informed choices about what they eat.""Mandatory labelling that provides nutritional information in the most easy to understand way possible is a measure we support, but further research is needed on what this should look like.""",Newspaper
407,Public support grows for wearing masks;Protection Two in five want facial coverings - but infection rates could spiral through incorrect use of them,"April 19, 2020",International,The Sunday Telegraph (London),685,685,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,Edward Malnick,Public support grows for wearing masksProtection Two in five want facial coverings - but infection rates could spiral through incorrect use of them,"PUBLIC support for wearing face coverings in public outweighs opposition, a poll has found, as a government adviser warned that more people could be put at risk of infection as a result of masks being worn incorrectly.A survey of 1,500 people found that 41 per cent of respondents believed the public should be asked to wear masks, or makeshift masks, now or in the future, compared with 33 per cent who disagreed. The remaining 26 per cent said they did not know either way.The poll was conducted on Friday as ministers prepared to decide whether to issue official guidance asking the population to use masks or other face coverings to help reduce the spread of the virus in public places, following a review by the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), which is due to discuss the issue on Tuesday.But Susan Michie, a professor of health psychology at University College London, who is advising the Government on how the population responds to its measures, said many people were already potentially exposing themselves and others to coronavirus by using masks improperly. She also warned of a ""false reassurance"" that means mask wearers could be ""much less likely"" to follow social distancing rules as well as guidance on handwashing and using tissues.Last week, Sadiq Khan, the Mayor of London, called for the compulsory use of masks during the pandemic. But the UK's current approach is in line with World Health Organisation recommendations, which suggest the devices should only be worn by those taking care of people with Covid-19, or by patients with symptoms. Prof Michie suggested the Government could recommend the use of masks by ""heavily exposed"" people such as shopkeepers and transport workers, rather than instructing their use by the population at large. One option under consideration is advising the use of masks on public transport. The poll, by Redfield & Wilton Strategies, also found that the idea of the Government requiring the public to wear masks made only a slight difference to fears held by respondents about leaving their homes when current lockdown measures are relaxed. Some 31 per cent of people said they would still feel unsafe leaving their homes if the lockdown ends on May 7 - the date to which the current measures have been extended. That figure drops to 28 per cent when people are asked how they would feel about leaving their homes if the Government requires the public to wear masks. Speaking to The Sunday Telegraph in a personal capacity, Prof Michie, who sits on the behavioural and communications subgroup of Sage, said the question of whether to encourage the use of masks by the population at large was ""very tricky"".She said: ""Currently, there is no evidence masks in community settings are helpful … The problem about the idea of wearing masks in a general community setting is human behaviour. ""People touch their masks. They take them off and put them on, and when they speak to people, they take them off, which is exactly the time when you should have them on. When they take them off, they'll touch the mask, when you're just meant to [touch] the little bits around your ears.""Prof Michie warned that members of the public also tend to put masks down on to surfaces that could be contaminated. She added: ""It's a great collector of viruses - a damp, warm place that can nicely collect them. The problem is that people often don't throw them away, they use them several times.""Prof Michie also warned that people feel ""very reassured by masks"" despite the fact they offer no protection against the virus entering a wearer's eyes.She added: ""Once there is false reassurance, people may be less likely to pay attention to social distancing. The association between wearing it and feeling safe could put more at risk.""Sir Patrick Vallance, the chief scientific adviser, has said the Government's position on masks will change if the evidence warrants a shift. On Friday, Grant Shapps, the Transport Secretary, said: ""It looks like the advantages might be marginal - there can even be times when it's disadvantageous if they're not used properly.""",Newspaper

The Scottish Football Association even hopes to open a new campaign with its cup semi-finals, which would ordinarily attract an aggregate of at least 80,000 spectators.Both options are now seriously remote, with Nicola Sturgeon also suggesting matches with no spectators would not be viable unless there is a major coronavirus breakthrough. block-time published-time 6.50pm BST Foster carers across the UK are calling for sick pay during coronavirus pandemic, warning they are currently being forced to chose between their own health, the wellbeing of the foster child, and the need to pay their bills. Foster care workers are as self-employed and have no entitlement to sick pay. A union said that foster carers who develop symptoms risk losing their income if children are therefore not assigned to their care. Jane Wright, chair of the IWGB foster care workers branch, says: Our work is not only more challenging but also more important now than ever. In a pandemic, denial of sick pay threatens to plunge even more of us into poverty. With a six week wait for universal credit, any unwell foster care worker forced to self-isolate risks destitution. They may be unable to pay bills and if they lose their house, their fostered child has nowhere to come home to.One foster care worker, who wished to remain anonymous, said:  The government needs to do something. My rent didn't go down because I was sick. My job didn't get any easier because I was sick. They took the money right out of my bank account. They treat us like we're nothing, but who's feeding this baby? Who's buying wet wipes and nappies and heating and rent to keep him safe and warm? I'm looking after a vulnerable child. Who's looking after us?block-time published-time 6.46pm BST  Rishi Sunak's press conference - Summary  Here are the main points from Rishi Sunak 's press conference.•Sunak, the chancellor, refused to accept that it might have been a mistake to allow a Champions League match involving Liverpool and Atlético Madrid to go ahead on 11 March - even though a government scientist appeared to concede at the same press conference that the event may have contributed to the spread of coronavirus in the UK. Some 3,000 Atlético fans travelled to Merseyside for the match, at a time when some lockdown measures were already in force in Spain. The mayor of Madrid, José Luis Martínez-Almedia, has said that allowing the fixture to go ahead was a mistake. At the press conference Prof Dame Angela McLean, the government's deputy chief scientific adviser, was asked if the match should have been cancelled. She appeared to defend the decision to allow it, saying that in normal circumstances a match like that would not be a risk. But then she went on to concede that it might have contributed to the coronavirus spread. She said:However, when you get to the situation of our strange lives as we live them now where we spend all our time basically at home, of course you wouldn't add on an extra risk of lots and lots of people going off to the same place at the same time.I think it will be very interesting to see in the future when all the science is done what relationship there is between the virus that has circulated in Liverpool and the virus that has circulated in Spain. That's certainly an interesting hypothesis you raise there.Her comment surprised journalists. For example, this is from ITV's political editor Robert Peston. enltrThat was a ""wow"" moment. The deputy chief scientific adviser Angela McLean said suggestion from Liam Thorp of Liverpool Echo that allowing Athletic Madrid to play in Liverpool may have increased spread of illness in Liverpool was ""an interesting hypothesis"".

Yet this is the first time she's thought of it?- Piers Morgan (@piersmorgan) April 20, 2020But after McLean gave her answer, Sunak was pressed by the Liverpool Echo's  Liam Thorp on whether the government should have allowed the match to go ahead. Sunak refused to accept the decision to allow it might have been a mistake. He said:At every stage in this crisis we've been guided by the scientific advice and have been making the right decision at the right time...Of course, This is an unprecedented situation we're all dealing with, I'm sure there are all things that we will learn from this.But in terms of the guidance that we put in place, I believe that it was the right guidance at the right time, based on the scientific advice that we were provided with.It would not have been hard to say that, although that decision was based on scientific advice at the time, in retrospect maybe it wasn't so wise after all. But that would have taken Sunak into ""admitting error"" territory, somewhere no politician is comfortable venturing to.•Prof Yvonne Doyle, the medical director for Public Health England, defended the PHE decision to issue guidance last week advising NHS staff to wear aprons in some circumstances instead of full-length gowns when the right equipment was not available. She said this was a ""precautionary set of advice"", based on guidance that already existed and in line with WHO advice covering exceptional circumstances.

What has happened over the weekend is to cover people really and give them some security in exceptional circumstances, advice has been produced jointly with the NHS about how to be safe in circumstances where supplies may be at risk.And that is a very precautionary set of advice - it's quite the opposite to putting people at risk because there aren't enough supplies.It's trying to ensure that people are well secured and safe when there may not be enough supplies, and it also stresses how important it is not to take risks and when it is not right to do certain things and practices with the PPE.Doyle said it would be for staff to decide what was safe and what wasn't. She explained:Certainly people have to make their decisions based on whether they are in a risky situation or not. It is very difficult to legislate for all of that from a distance here. But the guidance is very clear on what is safe and not safe to do.•Doyle said a lack of PPE (personal protective equipment) was ""a concern"" but insisted officials were ""working very hard"" to improve the situation. Sunak said the government was doing everything it could to address the shortage. He said:We're improving our sourcing internationally and domestically to make sure we can get the PPE we need in what is a very challenging international context.But people on the frontline can rest assured that we're doing absolutely everything we can and straining everything we can to get the equipment they need.•Sunak said more than 140,000 firms had today applied for help from the government's coronavirus job retention scheme.

The number of prisoners who had tested positive for Covid-19 increased 9% in the same period to 278 inmates across 64 prisons. There are around 81,500 prisoners in England and Wales, in 117 prisons. A total of 13 prisoners are known to have contracted Covid-19 and died, including one inmate who died within prison walls.

(See 5.05pm.) Tomlinson said:The sheer scale of applications for the government's job retention scheme on its opening day shows just how badly the scheme is needed. Without firms having the option to furlough staff, Britain could be facing the prospect of totally unprecedented numbers of people being unemployed. The claims made today alone are set to cost at least £4.2bn if staff are furloughed for three months.The demand today also indicates that the new IT system has managed to cope with significant claims. The next challenge is to make sure the payments to firms get made as swiftly as possible, as the scheme is very much on the frontline of protecting both firms and family incomes amid a huge economic crisis.block-time published-time 5.41pm BST  Sunak is now wrapping up.

He says they will keep this policy under review.Q: Do you have any modelling that suggests how people might behave when the lockdown measures are relaxed?That is a good question, says McLean.

It puts the current rate at 0.7 and, based on Imperial College calculations, it says that it would be impossible to lift the main measures currently in place (except school closures) with R rising above 1.

There were 35 pregnant women in prison and 34 MBU inmates as of 6pm on 30 March. The justice secretary, Robert Buckland, told the Joint Committee on Human Rights that only 17 had been released so far.He said: You're going to say to me well that doesn't sound very many. That's because I want to make sure each of them has a package of support so they're not merely released to the community because some of them will sadly have come from abusive relationships and can't go back to the former family home.I want to make sure they have the accommodation, and the support generally not just for them but either for the unborn child or the very young child whose rights are really important and underpin the approach I've taken with regards to seeking to safeguard this vulnerable cohort.block-time updated-timeUpdated at 4.10pm BSTblock-time published-time 3.55pm BST A new emergency hospital in Glasgow may not be needed because the coronavirus outbreak in Scotland appears to be plateauing thanks to high levels of public adherence to the lockdown, the hospital's chief executive has confirmed.The Louisa Jordan hospital opened at the Scottish Events Campus for its first patients on Monday, with a potential capacity of 1,036 beds. Jill Young, its chief executive, said it would open beds 40 at a time, basing its occupancy on normal hospital ward numbers.They have 100 staff on standby for the first patients but Young said there was no call yet on its facilities, which are due initially to remain at the SEC for five months but will remain there for as long as needed.The number of Covid-19 patients in Scottish hospitals and in intensive care beds has begun to fall. There were more than 200 people in ITU units in mid-April, but only 169 this morning.Young said:The reason the hospitals and health boards out there are coping so well, we have to give credit and thanks to the Scottish population. The compliance with the guidance they've been given is just tremendous.It has given us hope, as you've heard from the first minister and cabinet secretary [the health secretary, Jeane Freeman], that the numbers are not increasing as fast as we imagined they would and in fact they look like they're plateauing. But it's far too early to take any final predictions on that, so we have to stand ready at any point in time to open.At the moment, the numbers look like we will not be required to open, certainly within the next few days, and we're receiving a daily update on that. Young added that much of the equipment and furniture installed there would be reused within the NHS if the hospital was not required. Its construction and installation costs totalled £43m, with local businesses donating around £1m in supplies, including free concrete and steel.block-time updated-timeUpdated at 3.56pm BSTblock-time published-time 3.51pm BST  What it's like to work on the coronavirus frontline - a photo essay  From emergency arrivals to critical care, the Guardian was given extraordinary access to UHCW hospital in Coventry to document the Covid-19 pandemic.

The source code will be provided so there will be independent scrutiny of that, so the transparency element is going to be at the heart of the development.Buckland said the app would be compliant with the GDPR, the Human Rights Act, and the Equality Act.

(Unless, of course, you have already made your mind up about the prime minister, in which case you shouldn't be reading this bit.)                   The Sunday Times                   ' Insight investigation laid out the timeline of how this year unfolded, including the sense that by the time it was accepted by the British political and scientific establishment that Covid-19 was worse than a bit of flu it was too late to do too much about it.Blaming Mr Johnson for sunning himself at Christmas, as if he should have known that China was going to tell the world it had picked up some unusual pneumonia cases in Wuhan, is perhaps a little unfair.But the overwhelming sense, created admittedly by people who seem to have it in for him, is that the PM was unconcerned about it all, missing five meetings of the Cobra emergency committee discussing coronavirus. Outrageous dereliction of duty, said many. Entirely normal, said Downing Street in an extensive response to the story, which included pointing out that Labour's Alan Johnson chaired Cobra as health secretary to discuss hlN1, a respiratory disease that threatened life around the world.When the Cobra meetings went ahead without the PM, the World Health Organisation had not even declared Covid-19 a ""public health emergency of international concern"", as it did on January 30. In early February the WHO was advising countries not to impose lockdown measures, and it only declared a global pandemic on March 11, when Britain had already had eight deaths.Britain sent 279,000 items of its depleted stockpile of protective equipment to China, said                    The                   Sunday Times                   . The equipment was not from the pandemic stockpile, insists the government, and since then China has reciprocated many times over, sending more than 12 million pieces of PPE to the UK this month.However, the suggestion that Mr Johnson had his eye off the ball - distracted by fighting on multiple fronts including Brexit, the BBC, the lobby, and the not insignificant matter of his girlfriend being pregnant - is an easy one to stick on a man known to be keener on posing for photo ops than poring over details.It is possible, though, that he had his eye on the ball, but had been told it was a small ball that was nothing to worry about.The threat of a global pandemic bringing the entire planet to a standstill was not taken seriously because it seemed so unlikely. Health experts (and, bluntly, quite a lot of health journalists) had been around the block on big scares like this many, many times. It was a theoretical threat that never comes true. Until it does.Recall that the big row about Mr Johnson ""sunning himself"" in Mustique was not over coronavirus but the prospect of World War Three erupting after a US drone strike killed the Iranian general Qassem Soleimani. With hindsight it was fine to stay on his hols, but had the conflict escalated as many had feared it would later have looked to have been reckless.The government insists it has been gripped by coronavirus since early January, with Matt Hancock holding daily meetings about it for three months.So the question is not one of negligence but inadequacy. Why was more not done, sooner, to head off the threat posed by Covid-19?Did the scientists advising the government play down the seriousness because they did not think it was serious at that point? Or did they think it was serious but not suggest more dramatic action because they knew their political masters wouldn't go along with it?Was this political reluctance informed by a belief, even evidence, that we as a country would not comply with draconian restrictions? Instead of relying on behavioural scientists to advise on what the public would do, could more effort have been put into changing those behaviours?Would the British public only accept a lockdown when there had been ""enough"" cases and deaths, by which time it was probably too late? It is incredible the way the lockdown, unthinkable even five or six weeks ago, is now our everyday experience and so seems entirely logical in a way that it just wasn't before.Having been ahead of the game with early contact tracing, Britain lost control. Though in part this was because by the time news came through in the third week of February of deaths in Iran and Italy - two countries that Britain has close travel links with - the game was up. As Reuters noted in this excellent report this month: ""There was a rule of thumb that, in an outbreak's early stages, for each death there were probably 1,000 cases in a community."" It meant there were thousands and thousands of cases in Italy alone, and therefore probably in the UK too.Critics say that the last government rehearsal for a pandemic was in 2016, and the lessons were not learnt. The government insists they were. Either way, the plan was so focused on the idea of a flu pandemic that - along with much of the scientific community - it struggled to adjust to something more serious.None of this is to defend the government's handling. In the early stages the communication was muddled and contradictory, from telling people to still shake hands to pre-announcing things that might happen in future, adding to confusion about what was happening now.The PPE shortages should shame those responsible. Whether it is true that emergency stocks have dwindled over the years of austerity is hard to know (and it would be an interesting inquiry for the health select committee, chaired by Jeremy Hunt, who just happened to be the health secretary for many of the years in question).But sending NHS workers, often on low wages, always on long, gruelling shifts, into battle without the right equipment is indefensible. That Lord Deighton, who oversaw the Olympics, has now been hired to sort it out is something, but likening it to the way ""Lord Beaverbrook spearheaded the wartime efforts on aircraft production"" is a bit of a cheek when newspapers were suggesting exactly this almost three weeks ago.Far from this situation getting better it seems to be getting worse, with warnings that supplies of masks and gowns could run out today, with doctors and nurses saying they are being forced to choose between saving their patients, or saving themselves. However, while the death toll of health workers continues to rise each day and shame those responsible, the PPE shortages alone are not the reason the total number of deaths in Britain has topped 16,000.Similarly, an earlier lockdown of, say, a week would probably only be having a significant effect about now, given the lag between infection and deaths.Test, test, test scream the critics, but as this table shared by Robert Peston at the weekend shows, Germany and Italy have tested the same proportion of their population but have dramatically different results in terms of cases and deaths.And if this terrible plan was all down to the evil, useless Tories, why have the likes of the SNP's Nicola Sturgeon and Labour's Sadiq Khan largely gone along with it?Poring over the past right now might seem like a distraction. And for those who are no fan of the PM, there is something cathartic about sharing tales of shortcomings to reassure themselves that they were right about the bad guy all along.But it also informs what happens next: the decisions made by politicians based on scientific advice about how, when, where, even whether to lift the lockdown.As the                    Times                    splash reveals today, Mr Johnson has told colleagues that he is very cautious about easing lockdown restrictions and that his ""overriding concern"" is avoiding a second wave of the coronavirus pandemic.This potentially pits the PM against his chancellor, Rishi Sunak, and the senior minister Michael Gove, who think that once the peak of the virus has passed and the transmission rate lowered the government should ""run things quite hot"" and ease restrictions.If the judgment about when to impose restrictions was fraught with contradictory and partial information and advice, this next stage will be even worse.As Sir Jeremy Farrar, director of the Wellcome Trust and member of the government's scientific advisory group for emergencies, told Sky News'                    Sophy Ridge on Sunday                   : ""It is clear that the lockdown can't go on for much longer. The damage it's doing to all of our health, our wellbeing, our mental health, is disproportionately of course affecting the most vulnerable.""Juggling the competing pressures of reducing coronavirus deaths while preventing long-term economic damage, which itself can harm the health of the nation, is like almost every conundrum this crisis has thrown up: choose between deaths now or deaths later.Something I wrote last month still stands: ""Anyone who has 'crunched their own numbers' or 'saw something online' or thinks it is 'common sense' or it 'stands to reason' that the government should be doing X or Y is missing the point: there is no correct answer. This is a judgment call. There is no option where there are no sick people and no deaths. We will not know who was right for months, years, possibly ever.""Tony Blair, one of the five people alive with some idea of what Mr Johnson faces, told the                    Today                    programme this morning: ""I have never come across anything more complicated or difficult in politics than this.

410,Government insists PPE safe to reuse as Turkey shipment fails to arrive,"April 20, 2020 Monday",International,telegraph.co.uk,3850,3850,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,"By Cat Neilan, Politics Live Editor",Government insists PPE safe to reuse as Turkey shipment fails to arrive,"•The traffic light system the UK could follow to ease out of lockdown•Economic damage from lockdown needs to end in next four weeks•Join the Telegraph Community Facebook group​•Subscribe to The Telegraph, free for one month•Telegraph Coronavirus Appeal: Join us in helping those hit hardestThe government has insisted NHS workers will be safe to reuse PPE if supplies run out, saying new advice follows WHO guidelines. Speaking during this evening's daily press conference, Public Health director Yvonne Doyle said updated advice was for ""exceptional circumstances where supplies may be at risk"". ""It is consistent with what the WHO says what in exceptional circumstances should be done,"" she added. But asked if NHS staff had the right to refuse to work without PPE-under pressure because of global shortages-Prof Doyle said a decision was ""very much based on people's judgement"". ""People have to make their decisions based on whether they are in a risky situation or not. The guidance is very clear on what is and what is not safe to do."" Chancellor Rishi Sunak confirmed that a further 140,000 gowns-thought to be two or three days' supply-has arrived from Myanmar, although the equivalent shipment from Turkey is yet to arrive. 20 Apr 2020-06:10PM BSTLight at the end of the tunnel-but still lots of unanswered questionsThat's it for another day, folks.In many ways, we have finished where we started. The government is still under fire over PPE. A shipment of gowns has arrived which will cover the NHS for the next couple of days, buying critical breathing space-but there is still no sign of that batch from Turkey. Chancellor Rishi Sunak had another successful outing, burnishing his credentials as a safe pair of hands and signing off with a hopeful promise of light at the end of the tunnel.But while Yvonne Doyle stressed it was safe to reuse PPE when following newly published guidance, she dodged the question about whether NHS staff were right to refuse to work without it. Meanwhile Angela McLean may have opened a can of worms by saying it was ""an interesting hypothesis"" to suggest the Liverpool-Athletico Madrid game in March could have helped spread the virus between fans. 20 Apr 2020-05:43PM BSTMcLean: Hard to predict how many people will work 'as normal' after coronavirusAngela McLean has said it will be ""very hard to predict"" how many people will go back to work as normal once the outbreak is under control. She said behavioural scientists who advise the government had been careful and would probably say it was difficult to predict.""How much people will go back to work, when and if it becomes available, will be very hard to predict given what strange days we are in,"" she adds. 20 Apr 2020-05:41PM BSTShould football matches have been cancelled?Asked about a football match held on 11 March between Liverpool and Atletico Madrid, Rishi Sunak says he ""stands by"" the way decisions were made at the time.""At every stage at this crisis we have been guided by the scientific advice and made the right decisions at the right time,"" he says. There is ""often a wrong time to put certain measures in place"" he adds, in a nod to the argument that if lockdown had happened too soon, it would have a limited benefit despite widespread disruption. Angela McLean says the context is important. ""In our recent history, where we were living our lives as normal, in that circumstance going to a football match was not particular risky,"" she says. But in the current risk climate ""of course you wouldn't add on extra risk of lots of people going off to same place at same time"". She said it would be interesting to see whether there was any connection to the outbreaks in Liverpool and Spain. 20 Apr 2020-05:31PM BSTDoyle: Advice on reusing PPE 'consistent' with WHO guidanceDr Yvonne Doyle has said medics should follow advice on reusing PPE which is ""consistent"" with WHO guidance on what to do ""in exceptional circumstances"".  ""I understand people's anxieties on the frontline when they are in a very uncertain situation,"" she added. ""The advice has been put out precisely about what is the right and what is not the right"" approach. Asked if she would support people's right not to work if they didn't feel it was safe, Prof Doyle said people will make their own judgement. Chancellor Rishi Sunak added: ""What we have put in place is a hotline that anyone can call to alert us to issues with PPE. We are very much we are determined to do everything we can to support those NHS workers .""20 Apr 2020-05:19PM BSTYvonne Doyle: PPE 'is a concern'Dr Yvonne Doyle confirms that 12 million pieces of PPE were delivered to 141 trusts over the weekend-but admits: ""It is concern, we want people to have what they need.""The situation was challenging because of the ""very high burn rate"" but authorities were working to secure more items, as well as ""to ensure that people use guidance in most precautionary way to make best use of what is available"".Chancellor Rishi Sunak said medics ""deserve to have the equipment they need to do their job safely"".On a second question regarding the business loan schemes, Sunak reveals there have now been 12,000 approved-double the number a week ago.He says there are ""signs of progress there which I'm watching very carefully"".20 Apr 2020-05:15PM BSTSeventh straight day of drop in London hospital numbersFor the seventh day in a row, the number of people who are in London's hospitals with coronavirus has fallen.Prof Dame Angela McLean said the number across the whole country ""remains stable, but here in London for the seventh day in row those numbers have fallen"". She added: ""We are looking forward to seeing that replicated across the country.""Prof McLean said the rate of coronavirus infection in the UK has ""stopped rising and is now pretty much stable and flat"".Dr Yvonne Doyle acknowledges that while nine out of 10 deaths occur in hospital, there are many that are not included and that there is ""an uneven pattern"" across the country.20 Apr 2020-05:07PM BSTSunak: Over 140,00 firms have applied for furlough schemeMore than 140 000 firms have applied to the government's furlough scheme, as of 4pm today, Rishi Sunak says. That will the money provided to them will help pay the wages for more than a million people.The scheme was only launched today, and firms will begin receiving support in six days, he adds. ""At times like this the state must turn to its most immediate purpose, the protection and support of its people,"" as a ""bridge through the worst,"" Mr Sunak says. The government has also been ""sowing the seeds of our ultimate recovery"", he adds, and that is what will drive our growth. 20 Apr 2020-05:03PM BSTSunak kicks off with PPEChancellor Rishi Sunak says the UK is receiving shipments regularly from domestic suppliers as well as those from overseas-including a shipment of 140,00 gowns from Myanmar. The Turkish shipment is still delayed, however. ""We are working hard to get the PPE our frontline NHS and social care staff need,"" he says. 20 Apr 2020-05:00PM BSTNew York daily deaths drop againNew York governor Andrew Cuomo says there were 478 deaths across the state yesterday-a slight drop compares to the 507 daily deaths rise the day before.Echoing comments made by Downing Street advisers, Mr Cuomo stresses it is the infection rate-what the experts refer to as the R-number-rather than deaths that is key.We have our eye clearly on the ball here - the infection rate.It's the single indicator of risk and spread.As we make decisions it is the gauge I will be watching.- Andrew Cuomo (@NYGovCuomo) April 20, 202020 Apr 2020-04:48PM BSTTests for bus drivers?Downing Street is considering expanding the list of people who can qualify for coronavirus tests, in a bid to hit its self-imposed target of 100,000 test a day by the end of this month. As of 9am yesterday 21,626 tests were carried out across Great Britain, with 16,460 at NHS Trust and Public Health labs, while just 4,789 were conducted at the drive through sites. A further 377 were carried out as part of an ongoing surveillance testing programme. Total capacity was just 36,000-down two thousand from last week. The Prime Minister's spokesman said demand from NHS workers had been lower than expected, which is why Health Secretary Matt Hancock had expanded the list of people who could seek tests to include prison officers and firefighters, among others. That could be further rolled out to include bus and tube drivers, the spokesman said today.""It is perfectly possible that we could extend still further-where we have capacity we want to use it,"" he said.20 Apr 2020-04:32PM BSTUK coronavirus deaths fall againThe UK-wide figures have just been published and they show another decline in the daily deaths-although the weekend lag factor will be playing a part.

The committee has also requested ""some more granular information"", including the total amount loaned under the schemes by provider, which can be provided on a weekly basis.Mr Stride said: ""There have been some important changes that the government has brought in to step up delivery but further improvements are now vital. We must get these systems firing on all cylinders to help businesses survive and achieve a quick V-shaped recovery.""Data on the volume and value of these loans is published too infrequently.

The Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry and an expert in global supply chains from the University of Sussex will be among the first witnesses, followed by the Health Care Supplies Association and the Association of British HealthTech Industries.

Part of the 2,100 word rejection of the weekend's brutal article over government inaction cited Mr Horton as evidence there was no consensus about the severity of coronavirus in mid-January. But Mr Horton has insisted his comments were about ""caution in UK media reporting"", and highlighted a number of other points he made raising the flag over the outbreak. Just for the record: the UK government is deliberately rewriting history in its ongoing COVID-19 disinformation campaign. My Jan 24 tweet called for caution in UK media reporting.

Boris Johnson is ""receiving updates on the coronavirus response"", having held meetings with senior members of the Number 10 team and spoken to Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab on Friday. But his focus is still getting better. ""The Prime Minister is continuing to focus on his recovery at Chequers, guided by the advice of his medical team,"" his spokesman says. He is receiving written updates, but not his red box and Mr Raab continues to deputise.It sounds likely that the First Secretary of State will take the despatch box-either virtually or in person-at PMQs on Wednesday.

""The measures which we have in place are in place for a further three weeks and work will be carried out by Sage to look at all the evidence and provide an update to ministers,"" said the spokesman. He pointed to comments made by Mr Raab last week, in which he suggested measures could be tightened up in some places while relaxed in others.Asked if restrictions could be in place until autumn, he said he was ""not going to pre-empt what the science says"".Before that, however, we can expect the Sage sub-group Nervtag to give its verdict on face masks. 20 Apr 2020-01:10PM BSTPPE 'global shortage' putting pressure on gownsSecuring PPE is an ""absolute priority"", the Prime Minister's spokesman says.

411,Coronavirus: sprightly Rishi Sunak hosts the daily exercise class,"April 20, 2020 Monday",International,thetimes.co.uk,614,614,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,Quentin Letts,Coronavirus: sprightly Rishi Sunak hosts the daily exercise class,"Greetings, grapple fans. As the chancellor gaily reminded us at yesterday's daily Downing Street deck exercises, we've now been on voyage for a month. Rishi Sunak observed lightly that it was a month since he stood at that same lectern and first announced his coronavirus rescue package for businesses. He's hearty, Rishi. Likes to chivvy us along. Kept saying ""Brilliant!"" yesterday, zipping through his spiel. Slim, spry, he was the embodiment of health and efficiency, lacking only a pair of hoisted-to-the-navel Speedos and a beach ball.Can it really be only a month? The sea is glass. If the horizon changes, it does it on the sly when I'm not looking. The family has bought my mother a Portal video device but she hasn't yet got the hang of its name and calls it ""my porthole"". Somehow that matches the ancient mariner mood.Is that an albatross circling to starboard? Now you mention it, Mr Sunak's strong nose does bear a faint resemblance to an albatross's bill. You might not want to let him near your koi carp pond.This buoyant young chancellor recalled that a month ago he had promised to pay lots of people's wages. Now he was able to say: ""Today we deliver our promise.""He did not despair at the doubloons cascading out of the nation's coffers. That is not the Sunak way. ""We have,"" he declared, ""been sowing the seeds of our recovery!"" He said another £1.25 billion of public money will be spent on innovative firms. Now he was on to stirring stuff about our national innovation agency and how we were going to bounce back, provided we continued to follow lockdown rules and avoided a second peak.Talk of a second peak was, perhaps, a good sign, for it could suggest we have passed the first peak. Not that they like to say that. For all Mr Sunak's virtuous vigour - he is the sort of bloke who has never eaten a whole packet of fig rolls in one sitting and then been consumed by guilt -the good news was still being sharply rationed.The Ministry of Defence's Professor Dame Angela McLean conceded that London hospitalisation rates had now dropped seven days in succession. That was all the statistical optimism we were permitted. One pipette per ocean-full of salted tears.The media were interested in PPE for health workers.Sky's Beth was back (first appearance for ages - did she pull an eyelash muscle with all that mascara?) She waxed on about terror among hospital staff who lacked protective gear. Mr Sunak twice said ""everybody has worked incredibly hard"".This has become a staple of modern politics. Over a billion pieces of PPE had now been delivered, more than 12 million pieces alone on Sunday. Beside him stood Mrs Doyle, the Irish science bod. Poor love, I wish they'd let her sit down. She looks so tired.Professor Peston of ITV treated us to one of his cameos, this time a mere 57 seconds. He peered down into his port hole like some enormous, shaggy cat. Behind him a member of his household was visible. She seemed to be searching for something. A full stop for Robert, perhaps.Then a young thruster from a new magazine for ""the European start-up ecosystem"" came on. He had a big advert for his publication beside him. He wanted to know about ""behavioural modelling"". Dame Angela said she had ""a whole sub-group of behavioural scientists called SpyB"" and they were analysing the public's morale.They should come to Herefordshire. Across the valley here, still lit by late sunshine as I write this, is a field where a neighbour keeps miniature donkeys. When not braying, the little creatures beat their heads and necks against their metal feeding troughs. That's it exactly. That's how the country is feeling. Further research by SpyB seems unnecessary.",Newspaper; Web Publication

The NHS would usually expect about 2,700 referrals a week. Last week there were 744 and the week before there were 948.Dr Smith said there was strong evidence that the reduction in people coming forward was because they did not want to risk contracting Covid-19 or did not want to burden the health service.""Now I don't believe for a second that either these diseases or these concerns have simply disappeared,"" Dr Smith said. ""So it leaves me worried that there are people out there who are not seeking help from their GP when they might need it.""This month Dr Smith said that the health service felt ""eerily quiet in relation to people presenting with illness which isn't Covid-19. That, as a clinician, is immediately disconcerting because that illness hasn't gone away somewhere,"" he said.Marion O'Neill, Cancer Research UK's head of external affairs in Scotland, said the figure was ""hugely concerning"" and that people should not be put off contacting their GP.""Early cancer diagnosis is often key. Many GP practices offer telephone and video conference facilities so people who are worried about breaching social isolation guidelines can still access support,"" Ms O'Neill said. ""It's clear the pandemic has left cancer diagnosis and treatment in a precarious position.""If lots of suspected cancer cases are not investigated until a later date, there's a risk of breaking an already flooded NHS system.""Figures released last week showed that there have been 1,515 more deaths under lockdown than in an average April. Of these 553 have not been attributed to Covid-19.There has also been a 54 per cent fall in attendances at accident and emergency units, leading to fears that people are avoiding the NHS.Linda Bauld, a behavioural scientist at Edinburgh University, has raised concerns that people are dying at home of heart attacks and other treatable conditions because they do not want to bother GPs. Conditions such as diabetes or high blood pressure are also thought to be harder to manage in lockdown.Nicola Sturgeon has said that it is vital to understand the reasons behind the extra deaths as the lockdown continues.At the Scottish government's daily briefing on the Covid-19 pandemic, Dr Smith encouraged people who found new lumps or had unusual bleeding to seek help as normal.He said the NHS remained open for business despite the virus and that people should not ignore any symptoms that they would have acted upon before the outbreak.""Some clinical investigations and cancer treatments may be altered due to the risks that Covid-19 poses, but it remains important that patients bring symptoms to their GP so they can be managed appropriately,"" Dr Smith said.""If it was urgent before Covid-19 it remains urgent now. Please seek help when you need it.""",Newspaper; Web Publication

Less than 12 hours after the Prime Minister's historic address to the nation on March 23, the London Underground was jammed with commuters (see video below), while builders were seen eating together in communal canteens, making a mockery of the Government's rule that no more than two people can gather together in public.Professor Susan Michie, Director of the University College London's Centre for Behaviour Change, warned that some people would simply not be able to carry out the measures, even if they wanted to.""Five million self-employed people are being left potentially destitute by the Government failing to offer financial supportas they have done for directly employed workers,"" she said. ""Since [statutory sick pay of] £94 is not enough to pay rent, bills, food for a family etc, they will be forced to carry on as usual.""The British Transport Police is now on hand to make sure only            critical workers are using the London Underground. But such an inauspicious start to the lockdown suggests the virus will spread further than it would have, had stricter measures been implemented earlier,            as they have in other countries. And it means that the measures we do have are likely to be in place for longer to ""flatten the curve"" in a way that would prevent a second dangerous peak.In addition, on April 1 the Government revealed figures that suggested the lockdown was starting to fray as data showed an ""uptick""            in the number of people using transport.The number of those using their cars and public transport, which had been consistently dropping since strict social distancing measures were introduced, rose for the first time.It is feared that sunny weather will prompt more people to break the rules and go outside to socialise as boredom kicks in.•: Can I go for a drive during lockdown?How long will lockdown last?Mr Raab said the Government needed to be satisfied of five things before it would consider it safe to adjust any of the current measures:•Protect the NHS's ability to cope and be confident that the NHS is able to provide sufficient critical care across the UK.•See a sustained and consistent fall in daily death rates to be confident the UK is beyond the peak.•Reliable data from Sage showing rate of infection is decreasing to manageable levels across the board.•Confident that testing capacity and PPE are in hand with supply able to meet future demand.•Confident that any adjustments to the current measures would not risk a second peak in infections which would overwhelm the NHS.When the lockdown was first announced, Professor Mark Woolhouse, Professor of Infectious Disease Epidemiology, University of Edinburgh, said: ""We now enter a phase of careful monitoring. We are looking for indicators first that the epidemic is slowing down and then for numbers of new cases to start to fall. ""After three weeks we will have to decide whether the restrictions need to be continued, can be relaxed, or can be relaxed temporarily with the expectation of imposing them again later. ""We must also monitor the damage that the lockdown is doing; damage to the economy, to education, to psychological well-being and to health and social care provision in the community. The impacts of this epidemic are too far reaching for policy decisions to be driven by epidemiology alone.""Professor Sheila Bird said that more cases in coming weeks would make it easier for the Government to predict how the epidemic is responding to lockdown measures, which will inform how long they remain in place. ""Once an epidemic takes hold, as now in UK, the country's own data - properly reported and interpreted - take precedence over modelling as the data tell us the actual toll which the epidemic is exacting,"" she said.""A huge amount can be inferred about the immediately forthcoming weeks from these data directly, including whether further policy changes are needed to reinforce social-distancing; for example in particular age groups.""Some experts are still concerned that the current restrictions do not go far enough while others say the government has been hit by an ""epidemic of action"", and is now bringing in measures that have little rationale. Professor Robert Dingwall, Professor of Sociology, at Nottingham Trent University, wrote in The Telegraph: ""It is another triumph of populism over science, of a capitulation to the demand to 'do something'. ""We are still seeing some notion that 'the people' are selfish and must be bullied and disciplined. ""The people are not selfish; they have behaved in ways that are individually rational but have collectively irrational results.""However Dr Andrea Collins, Senior Clinical Lecturer in Respiratory Medicine at the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine (LSTM), said: ""I believe that they have not quite gone far enough. The 'absolutely' necessary to go to work is still being used by some when it is not required-I think we need permits across controlled areas to go to a workplace.""Recent modelling from the universities of Exeter, Bristol and Warwick suggested that without any measures at all, the epidemic would have peaked around 133 days after first person-to-person transmission in Britain, which happened around February 28. So the lockdown has the potential of curtailing the spread by around seven weeks. A welcome relief for people who could have been facing lockdown for most of the summer.",Newspaper; Web Publication

415,For and against: should we lift the lockdown to save the economy?;Some countries are already looking to ease their lockdowns to save jobs. But at what risk to lives? Our experts go head-to-head,"April 21, 2020 Tuesday",International,telegraph.co.uk,2043,2043,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,By Ambrose Evans-Pritchard and Jeremy Warner,For and against: should we lift the lockdown to save the economy?Some countries are already looking to ease their lockdowns to save jobs. But at what risk to lives? Our experts go head-to-head,"They call it the ""winner's curse"". Success lulls you into a false sense of security. It is the temptation beguiling the German people as they relax their grip on Covid-19 a little too soon - to the horror of Dr Angela Merkel.Nord-Rhein Westphalia has reopened car dealerships. Rheinland-Pfalz is opening some shopping malls and zoos. School pupils are going back to class for the Abitur exams.Some Länder (German states) are pushing the envelope a long way, although Bavaria's Marcus Söder - ""Herr Lockdown"" to his foes - is still holding firm for now.The Berlin police say discipline was visibly breaking down over the weekend. Clusters of young people were gathering for barbecues. Others were crossing the city promiscuously to see friends.The same sense of nonchalant normality was apparent in Hamburg, Hanover and other cities.It seems that the first tentative steps to end Germany's lockdown has caused a ""messaging"" problem, something that the behavioural nudge unit in Downing Street will be watching closely. People are acting as if the virus has been defeated. This psychological shift may be hard to reverse.Chancellor Merkel castigated the leadership of her CDU party yesterday over ""an orgy of chatter"" on relaxation plans. She told journalists that the coronavirus is ""treacherous"" and will come back with exponential force if the country lowers its guard. ""We are still a long way from being out of the woods. It would be a crying shame if we were to stumble into a relapse with eyes wide open,"" she said.But health policy is the prerogative of the Länder. Dealing with them is like herding cats. Merkel is under massive pressure from business lobbies and segments of her own CDU party to get the economy going again. There are echoes of the US culture wars.North-Rhein Westpahlia's premier, Armin Laschet - front-runner to succeed Merkel - is de facto leader of the Trumpian ""liberate-the-people"" wing of the party, as well as being an enthusiast for coal-fired plants and a closet climate denialist.Michael Hüther from the German Economic Institute (IW) speaks for much of the economic professoriate in railing against lockdown measures, protesting that the damage to the German productive system (and indirectly to mental and physical health) has not been properly costed and that the cure is worse than the disease.The Mittelstand family firms that form the backbone of the Wirtschaftswunder ""economic miracle"" in Germany are falling through the safety net. The restaurant, hotel, and travel sectors face irreversible ruin. Germany, he says, will end up in a full-blown depression if there is no remedy very soon.Prof Hüther advocates ""smart distancing"" and warns the government that it would be well-advised to stick to voluntary consent rather than coercion, mindful of basic liberties and the constitutional foundations of German freedom. These are powerful arguments. But is he right?One is loath to criticise the Germans for their handling of this pandemic. They have done far better so far than the British, French, Dutch, Belgians, Spanish, or Italians - though not as well as Koreans - and were quicker to contain the spread of the virus by testing at the GP level.My own view is that Merkel is closer to the mark and that her country - despite her advice - is in danger of making a serious mistake.There are epidemiologists and virologists lined up on each side. One of the early alarmists has thrown in the towel, arguing that it is already too late to contain the virus and that the state should actively infect children and the young to accelerate herd immunity.Whether he is right will depend on the first reliable, extensive, and random antibody results. Germany has reduced the RO spread rate to 0.8 - below the Holy Grail figure of 1.0 - but hardliners say that is still not enough.Prof Michael Meyer-Hermann from the Helmholtz Centre for Infection Research in Brunswick said the current number is a mirage - an ""artistic effect"" - distorted by delayed reporting over the Easter week. He thinks the reproduction rate must fall to 0.2pc or 0.3pc to defeat the virus. ""Otherwise you will be walking a tightrope the whole time,"" he said.Prof Meyer-Hermann says an extra week of lockdown may inflict a lot of economic damage but not nearly as much damage as a second lockdown three weeks later as outbreaks erupt again. Germany does not yet have the surveillance structure in place for Korean-style contract tracing.The government says the necessary smartphone app will not be available for another month. It is an open question whether East Asian methods can ever work in any case under German data protection laws. There is a national allergy to Big Brother measures - commendable at most times - linked to the trauma of the 1930s and the East German Stasi.The fact that Germany's case fatality death rate is 3.1pc (according to the Robert Koch Institute) suggests that it is missing at least two-third of cases. Its testing may be good by UK or French standards but it is still not good enough to manage a 1.0 RO rate in a stable fashion.Lockdown hawks cite parallels with the US flu pandemic in 1918. There were mass protests demanding an end to quarantine policies after the first wave began to subside - even to the point of San Francisco's ""anti-mask league"", so like today's uprising in Michigan. But premature relaxation led to a second deadlier wave a few weeks later.There were justifications for this in 1918. No vaccine was coming. Countries had to build herd immunity. This time there are hopes of a fast-track vaccine by the autumn. We are learning more about antiviral treatment and clinical management every week. Delay infection by a few months and your survival chances are better.The Merkel view is that you pick your poison: either endure a hard lockdown until the job is done; or risk on-and-off lockdowns lasting much longer, vastly compounding the economic damage over time. Can governments keep shutting people up again and again with any hope of sustaining social consent? Doubtful.The Swedish experiment sheds less light on the complex trade-offs than many advocates claim. It relies mostly on voluntary compliance based on Nordic tradition - and abnormally high levels of single households - but there is still strict social distancing.State epidemiologist Anders Tegnell - a cult hero to some, a misguided ideologue to others - may be vindicated if he is correct that Stockholm and other key regions are already near the threshold of herd immunity. A big ""if"". We are probably only in chapter one of this saga.The British Government will not know the outcome of either the German or Swedish gambles in time to make their crucial decision on the exit strategy. The signs are that Boris Johnson is resisting calls from his own ""Laschet"" faction for premature lift-off.Downing Street has been terrorised by the all too real possibility that Britain will emerge with the highest per capita death in Europe - with grim reputational damage to nation, government, and party.It now has the loser's advantage of humility and political fear. A stoic UK with remarkable unity behind the NHS may be patient enough to resist temptation. It may be disciplined enough to handle the next phase of this pandemic tolerably well - by comparison at least. Fingers crossed.A long standing favourite in my family when I was growing up was a Victorian board game called ""The Prince's Quest: A Fairy Race Game"", a battered edition of which I still have in my possession.In this simple throw-of-the-dice, snakes-and-ladders type game, each player embarks on a different route to a common end destination, where a sleeping beauty awaits the first to arrive. But along the way the player is repeatedly beset by good and bad fortune, depending on which number they land on.The game is a good analogy for the fight against Covid-19. One moment, the end seems in sight; yet the next move dashes the player's hopes. Apparent progress is quashed by repeated setbacks. Though a global challenge, the pandemic is also quite plainly a national race, with some countries apparently doing better than others.Yet the Prince's Quest board also carries a warning; ""The race is not always to the swift, nor the battle to the strong"", and that may well end up the case with Covid-19 too. Those that appear to be doing well now, and are therefore tempted into lifting lockdowns prematurely, may in time regret it.Singapore, widely praised at the start of the outbreak for its containment measures, but now experiencing some of the highest per capita infection rates in the world, may be a case in point. China, too, where there appears to be a second outbreak in the Northern city of Harbin.Studies of the Spanish flu pandemic of 1918-20 show that those US cities that lifted restrictions early were more likely to have been hit by a second, more devastating wave of the infection.In the UK, the response to Covid-19 was initially instructed by the idea of herd immunity and reluctance to impose economically destructive social distancing measures. That turned out to be a mistake, resulting in high levels of infection and mortality.Possibly because of his own experience of the virus, the Prime Minister has now swung the other way, and is reluctant to lift the lockdown until he can be sure there won't be a second wave, requiring the restrictions to be re-imposed. His approach may also be governed by failure to get testing and tracing up to a level where it can be relied upon as an effective containment strategy.If experience in South Korea is anything to go by, national lockdown can be avoided using mass testing, tracing, and isolation techniques. This in turn has given Germany, which has also been ahead of the curve in testing and apparent containment, the confidence to announce a tentative, phased lifting of the lockdown.In doing so, the Chancellor, Angela Merkel, a naturally cautious politician and a scientist by training not given to taking risks, has been instructed by the advice of Leopoldina, Germany's National Academy of Sciences.But make no mistake, the debate over whether even this very cautious approach to lifting restrictions is appropriate has been just as intense in Germany as it is in the UK, with Leopoldina quite widely accused of putting economic considerations before saving lives.""At present, measures relevant to health are particularly important,"" its panel of ""experts"" say in the formal advice. ""In addition, immediate and long-term social and economic consequences must be taken into account for future decisions"".In starting to ease restrictions, Merkel seems to have taken these economic considerations on board. Meanwhile, several states in the US, with the apparent support of the President, are lifting restrictions before waiting to see if the pandemic is under control.It'll be a while before we know whether these are the right decisions, but what seems clear to me is that at some stage similar risks are going to have to be taken here in the UK if we are to avoid the complete desertification of our economy.Effective antiviral drugs and vaccines are still plainly some distance off, so for now we are going to have to learn to live with the virus, even if it results in a second wave. As it is, we must reconcile ourselves to some restrictions remaining in place for a long time. At best, we can expect only a gradual removal, dashing hopes of an early V shaped recovery in the economy.There is also likely to be some permanent damage even after the disease has burnt itself out, as all pandemics eventually do. The longer the restrictions persist, the deeper this damage is likely to be.Toward the end of The Prince's Quest, there are some really nasty squares you can land on, one of which sends you more than halfway back to the start.There is also the possibility of getting endlessly trapped in the hedge that surrounds the sleeping beauty and never completing the journey at all - so close, and yet so far.Let us hope the Germans know what they are doing. These are difficult choices, but we cannot just sit there and watch our economies burn.                     Which of our Telegraph columnists do you agree with and why?

419,Times letters: Striking the right balance over the lockdown,"April 21, 2020 Tuesday",International,thetimes.co.uk,2422,2422,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,WRITE TO LETTERS@THETIMES.CO.UK,Times letters: Striking the right balance over the lockdown,"Sir, Responding to news that elderly people may have to suffer lockdown for more than a year, Lord Hope of Craighead (letter, Apr 21) urges ""a balance"" between the public interest and the right to a family life. This would mislead, if taken to imply the comparative weighing of two fixed quantities. Rather, we need to determine the very meaning of a legal right to family life in our extraordinary circumstances. That will involve a variety of factors: the good of family relationships, the public interests in containing the epidemic and letting the economy revive, and the duties that those interests generate.If the freedom to resume normal relations entailed risks to their own health only, the elderly could decide for themselves. However, as more than 90 per cent of those dying from Covid-19 are aged over 60, that freedom also entails risks to the capacity of the NHS and the lives of others. Therefore, the government has a duty to decide how much freedom it is socially safe to grant the elderly, and what restrictions they have a duty to suffer.Once the lockdown is relaxed, virus-related deaths will increase. As and when the NHS seems able to cope, the right of elderly people to risk seeing their loved ones face to face should expand.                    Nigel Biggar                   Regius professor of moral and pastoral theology, University of OxfordSir, I was dismayed to read the quote by Paul Whiteman, of the National Association of Head Teachers, that ""a return to school is not a matter for debate - it is a question of science"" (""Schools stay shut as two in three pupils ignore online classes"", Apr 20). Even if the epidemiological debate about the virus were settled, which it is not, how we weight mortality risks (of predominantly older people) against child development and inequalities in learning is entirely a matter of debate. The judgment about whose welfare should be given priority in policy decisions is exactly that, a judgment, and cannot be settled by the evidence on virus transmission.                   Paul Dolan                   Professor of behavioural science, LSESir, In the debate as to whether the public should be wearing facemasks, the deaf community, who rely on lipreading and non-manual features in British Sign Language to communicate, has been overlooked. I am a deaf doctor, working on medical wards with acutely unwell patients, including those with coronavirus. I rely on lipreading to communicate.Only one manufacturer in the world, based in the US, produces surgical-grade transparent masks, and we are unable to obtain them in the UK. Despite involving organisations including the BMA and NHS England, we still do not have access to transparent masks.                   Dr Helen Grote                   Neurology registrar, Chelsea and Westminster HospitalSir, Of course the public should not take precious NHS supplies of facemasks (""Facemasks for public 'risk NHS shortage' "", Apr 21). I have been wearing a simple, effective and washable mask when I go out since the lockdown. It is a ski neck warmer and can be doubled up for extra protection. It covers nose, mouth and chin and stays snug. I was pleased to see from your photograph in yesterday's edition that the Duke of Sussex had the same idea.

Three of the major risk factors are known: obesity, type 2 diabetes and old age. Type 2 diabetes is about six times more likely in those of south Asian descent and about three times more likely in black Afro-Caribbean people, even when poor access to healthcare and lower socio-economic status do not apply.Obesity is strongly associated with Type 2 diabetes and creates insulin resistance and other metabolic changes that harm the cardiovascular system. Asians are more likely to be ""Tofi"" (thin outside and fat inside), with similar adverse metabolic effects. This seems to be associated with the dangerous cytokine storms in Covid-19. Older Asian and Afro-Caribbean people are also more likely to live with family members who may work with the public, thus increasing the risk of infection. These three factors go a long way to explaining the higher mortality in ethnic minority groups.                    Dr Christine Dewbury                   Ret'd GP, Shawford, Hants                   BIG BROTHER STATE                   Sir, Clare Foges is correct in advocating using technology to solve critical problems (""We need Big Brother to beat this virus"", Apr 20, and letter, Apr 21). There is a small, grossly over-represented group of people who continually stop the use of modern technology to solve problems. These are presumably the descendants of the man with the flag walking in front of cars. The NHS is full of good people working with one hand tied behind their back because they do not have a computer system that is a quarter as good as Amazon's. There is an urgent need to promote the use of existing technology and demonstrate that the vast majority of us would prefer to reap the benefits of that rather than be hindered by a few people who see only the downside.                   John Wales                   Wigton, CumbriaSir, Clare Foges's article underlines the importance of virus tracking technology to prevent the further spread of Covid-19 in the post-lockdown period. As nearly three quarters of a million citizens have signed up to be an NHS volunteer on the Good Sam app, might that not be a suitable platform for virus tracking? Using it would mean not having to write a new program; instead it could be the subject of a patch. It already uses mapping technology and a loud emergency service siren to alert the user. The NHS has the results of testing, which could be uploaded to the profiles of those users who have been infected.                   David Sneath                   Ravenshead, NottsSir, Just as policing in Britain is by consent, so too is the democratic process. These are singular times and the emergency rules brought in by government to address the coronavirus emergency are broadly tolerated for now by British subjects, but there are limits. Foges writes that people voluntarily cede personal information to social media organisations and says that is the basis for doing the same to the state. I disagree. Such people are perfectly free to do so; many more are free to eschew the pleasure. They do not wish to be coerced: it is called liberty.                    Mike Martin                   Bude, Cornwall                   RESPECT FOR CARERS                   Sir, Rachel Sylvester is right to draw attention to the invidious treatment of the thousands of multinational workers propping up our care system (""Scrap immigration rules that penalise carers"", Apr 21). Badges, medals and clapping are pathetic compensation for an immigration system that fails to look after foreign carers with dignity and respect by demanding unreal financial qualifications before and after they arrive.

Lady (Marie) Dickens, our great-grandmother, was a formidable Frenchwoman who managed to overcome ""insurmountable"" obstacles to secure the grave site after the war. It was no surprise to any of us, given the unspeakable horrors and confusion of the action that killed Ceddy, that his body was never found in that exact spot, and indeed the ground at Bouleaux Wood was further fought over for another two years.We know that he still lies somewhere near by in that field. Marie wrote: ""I am proud to think my influence will have taught my children and grandchildren to love that spot and that for many many years to come that grave will be cared for and tended by loving hands."" A century later she would be happy to know that we proudly continue to do that, and to follow the words inscribed on his memorial: ""Let those who come after him, see that his name is not forgotten.""

First, he could make a voluntary contribution to the Exchequer; and second, offer free holidays, including travel, on Necker Island to families of key workers.

Her interests were encouraged by a friend who passed on recommendations, one of which was                    A Suitable Boy                    by Vikram Seth (letter, Apr 21). Somewhat daunted by the size of the book she carefully cut up the novel into three volumes, neatly bound each part and then embarked on reading them. It took many months but she completed the trilogy.

As an undergraduate I would visit my girlfriend (now wife) at St Hugh's College. It seemed to me that the college had only to bottle the air of its corridors to sell the world's most potent aphrodisiac.

It really, really doesn't. Look it up.

A formal extension would place Britain at a huge disadvantage, keeping us subject to all EU law, present and future. It would cost many billions of pounds to the EU budget, sabotage vital negotiations for trade agreements with growing markets, and prolong business uncertainty in a time of crisis. Most dangerous of all, it would risk involving us in potentially astronomical bailout schemes in case of a eurozone meltdown.Both British and EU negotiators are perfectly capable of negotiating as planned. If limited extra time is needed, there are many ways of providing it other than a formal extension. That would be an act of reckless self-harm.

420,Cancer referrals plummeting,"April 21, 2020 Tuesday",International,The Times (London),513,513,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,Kieran Andrews,Cancer referrals plummeting,"A rush of patients seeking cancer treatment after putting off tests during the lockdown risks ""breaking an already flooded NHS"", experts have warned.Gregor Smith, the interim chief medical officer, said that the number of urgent referrals for suspected cancer had fallen by 72 per cent on the weekly average. The NHS would usually expect about 2,700 referrals a week. Last week there were 744 and the week before there were 948.Dr Smith said there was strong evidence that the reduction in people coming forward was because they did not want to risk contracting Covid-19 or did not want to burden the health service.""Now I don't believe for a second that either these diseases or these concerns have simply disappeared,"" Dr Smith said. ""So it leaves me worried that there are people out there who are not seeking help from their GP when they might need it.""This month Dr Smith said that the health service felt ""eerily quiet in relation to people presenting with illness which isn't Covid-19. That, as a clinician, is immediately disconcerting because that illness hasn't gone away somewhere,"" he said.Marion O'Neill, Cancer Research UK's head of external affairs in Scotland, said the figure was ""hugely concerning"" and that people should not be put off contacting their GP.""Early cancer diagnosis is often key. Many GP practices offer telephone and video conference facilities so people who are worried about breaching social isolation guidelines can still access support,"" Ms O'Neill said. ""It's clear the pandemic has left cancer diagnosis and treatment in a precarious position.""If lots of suspected cancer cases are not investigated until a later date, there's a risk of breaking an already flooded NHS system.""Figures released last week showed that there have been 1,515 more deaths under lockdown than in an average April. Of these 553 have not been attributed to Covid-19.There has also been a 54 per cent fall in attendances at accident and emergency units, leading to fears that people are avoiding the NHS.Linda Bauld, a behavioural scientist at Edinburgh University, has raised concerns that people are dying at home of heart attacks and other treatable conditions because they do not want to bother GPs. Conditions such as diabetes or high blood pressure are also thought to be harder to manage in lockdown.Nicola Sturgeon has said that it is vital to understand the reasons behind the extra deaths as the lockdown continues.At the Scottish government's daily briefing on the Covid-19 pandemic, Dr Smith encouraged people who found new lumps or had unusual bleeding to seek help as normal.He said the NHS remained open for business despite the virus and that people should not ignore any symptoms that they would have acted upon before the outbreak.""Some clinical investigations and cancer treatments may be altered due to the risks that Covid-19 poses, but it remains important that patients bring symptoms to their GP so they can be managed appropriately,"" Dr Smith said.""If it was urgent before Covid-19 it remains urgent now. Please seek help when you need it.""",Newspaper
421,"How long will the UK coronavirus lockdown last?;Dominic Raab has extended UK lockdown for a further three weeks and said restrictions will not be lifted until changes can be ""safely"" made","April 21, 2020 Tuesday",International,telegraph.co.uk,1100,1100,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,"By Sarah Knapton, Science Editor","How long will the UK coronavirus lockdown last?Dominic Raab has extended UK lockdown for a further three weeks and said restrictions will not be lifted until changes can be ""safely"" made","The Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab has extended UK lockdown measures for a further three weeks to prevent the spread of Covid-19. The announcement on Thursday 16 April comes hours after Mr Raab chaired a Cobra meeting to discuss the current social restrictions in place.The extension has been put in place for ""at least"" three weeks which will take the UK to May 7, when we can expect a second review.Mr Raab, who is deputising for Boris Johnson, said the Government was being ""as open as we responsibly can at this stage"". ""It would not be responsible to prejudge the evidence that Sage will have and review in just a few weeks' time.""The Foreign Secretary said the Government carefully followed what is happening in other countries but ""we've got to do what is right for the British people based on the advice of our experts, grounded in the conditions prevailing here in the UK"".He said that measures put in place had been successful but that SAGE said that some settings were still seeing infections spreading.He warned that relaxing social restrictions now would damage economy in the longterm.•How other countries are ending lockdown                     Is lockdown working?                     Less than 12 hours after the Prime Minister's historic address to the nation on March 23, the London Underground was jammed with commuters (see video below), while builders were seen eating together in communal canteens, making a mockery of the Government's rule that no more than two people can gather together in public.Professor Susan Michie, Director of the University College London's Centre for Behaviour Change, warned that some people would simply not be able to carry out the measures, even if they wanted to.""Five million self-employed people are being left potentially destitute by the Government failing to offer financial supportas they have done for directly employed workers,"" she said. ""Since [statutory sick pay of] £94 is not enough to pay rent, bills, food for a family etc, they will be forced to carry on as usual.""The British Transport Police is now on hand to make sure only            critical workers are using the London Underground. But such an inauspicious start to the lockdown suggests the virus will spread further than it would have, had stricter measures been implemented earlier,            as they have in other countries. And it means that the measures we do have are likely to be in place for longer to ""flatten the curve"" in a way that would prevent a second dangerous peak.In addition, on April 1 the Government revealed figures that suggested the lockdown was starting to fray as data showed an ""uptick""            in the number of people using transport.The number of those using their cars and public transport, which had been consistently dropping since strict social distancing measures were introduced, rose for the first time.It is feared that sunny weather will prompt more people to break the rules and go outside to socialise as boredom kicks in.•: Can I go for a drive during lockdown?How long will lockdown last?Mr Raab said the Government needed to be satisfied of five things before it would consider it safe to adjust any of the current measures:•Protect the NHS's ability to cope and be confident that the NHS is able to provide sufficient critical care across the UK.•See a sustained and consistent fall in daily death rates to be confident the UK is beyond the peak.•Reliable data from Sage showing rate of infection is decreasing to manageable levels across the board.•Confident that testing capacity and PPE are in hand with supply able to meet future demand.•Confident that any adjustments to the current measures would not risk a second peak in infections which would overwhelm the NHS.When the lockdown was first announced, Professor Mark Woolhouse, Professor of Infectious Disease Epidemiology, University of Edinburgh, said: ""We now enter a phase of careful monitoring. We are looking for indicators first that the epidemic is slowing down and then for numbers of new cases to start to fall. ""After three weeks we will have to decide whether the restrictions need to be continued, can be relaxed, or can be relaxed temporarily with the expectation of imposing them again later. ""We must also monitor the damage that the lockdown is doing; damage to the economy, to education, to psychological well-being and to health and social care provision in the community. The impacts of this epidemic are too far reaching for policy decisions to be driven by epidemiology alone.""Professor Sheila Bird said that more cases in coming weeks would make it easier for the Government to predict how the epidemic is responding to lockdown measures, which will inform how long they remain in place. ""Once an epidemic takes hold, as now in UK, the country's own data - properly reported and interpreted - take precedence over modelling as the data tell us the actual toll which the epidemic is exacting,"" she said.""A huge amount can be inferred about the immediately forthcoming weeks from these data directly, including whether further policy changes are needed to reinforce social-distancing; for example in particular age groups.""Some experts are still concerned that the current restrictions do not go far enough while others say the government has been hit by an ""epidemic of action"", and is now bringing in measures that have little rationale. Professor Robert Dingwall, Professor of Sociology, at Nottingham Trent University, wrote in The Telegraph: ""It is another triumph of populism over science, of a capitulation to the demand to 'do something'. ""We are still seeing some notion that 'the people' are selfish and must be bullied and disciplined. ""The people are not selfish; they have behaved in ways that are individually rational but have collectively irrational results.""However Dr Andrea Collins, Senior Clinical Lecturer in Respiratory Medicine at the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine (LSTM), said: ""I believe that they have not quite gone far enough. The 'absolutely' necessary to go to work is still being used by some when it is not required-I think we need permits across controlled areas to go to a workplace.""Recent modelling from the universities of Exeter, Bristol and Warwick suggested that without any measures at all, the epidemic would have peaked around 133 days after first person-to-person transmission in Britain, which happened around February 28. So the lockdown has the potential of curtailing the spread by around seven weeks. A welcome relief for people who could have been facing lockdown for most of the summer.",Newspaper; Web Publication

Gandham, managing director of eToro UK said: ""This insight reinforces just how vital apps are to our daily lives.""Ease of use and quick access to the information we want is key to the success of any app -things we've actively looked to include in the eToro app.""Taking much of the behavioural insights on board from the research, we're confident apps can play a part in people's daily life now more than ever, including everything from ordering food deliveries to making investing feel more accessible.""",Newspaper; Web Publication

Rheinland-Pfalz is opening some shopping malls and zoos. School pupils are going back to class for the Abitur exams.Some Länder (German states) are pushing the envelope a long way, although Bavaria's Markus Söder - ""Herr Lockdown"" to his foes - is still holding firm for now.The Berlin police say discipline was visibly breaking down over the weekend. Clusters of young people were gathering for barbecues. Others were crossing the city promiscuously to see friends. The same sense of nonchalant normality was apparent in Hamburg, Hanover and other cities.It seems the first tentative steps to end Germany's lockdown have caused a ""messaging"" problem, something that the behavioural nudge unit used by the Cabinet Office will be watching closely. People are acting as if the virus has been defeated. This psychological shift may be hard to reverse.Chancellor Merkel castigated the leadership of her CDU party yesterday over ""an orgy of chatter"" on relaxation plans. She told journalists that the coronavirus was ""treacherous"" and would come back with exponential force if the country lowered its guard. ""We are still a long way from being out of the woods. It would be a crying shame if we were to stumble into a relapse with eyes wide open,"" she said.But health policy is the prerogative of the Länder. Dealing with them is like herding cats.

There are echoes of the US culture wars.North-Rhine Westphalia's premier, Armin Laschet - the front-runner to succeed Merkel - is de facto leader of the Trumpian ""liberate-the-people"" wing of the party, as well as being an enthusiast for coal-fired plants and a closet climate-change denialist.Michael Hüther from the German Economic Institute speaks for much of the economic professoriate in railing against lockdown measures, protesting that the damage to the German productive system (and indirectly to mental and physical health) has not been properly costed and that the cure is worse than the disease.The Mittelstand family firms that form the backbone of the Wirtschaftswunder ""economic miracle"" in Germany, are falling through the safety net. The restaurant, hotel, and travel sectors face irreversible ruin. Germany, he says, will end up in a full-blown depression if there is no remedy very soon.Prof Hüther advocates ""smart distancing"" and warns the government that it would be welladvised to stick to voluntary consent rather than coercion, mindful of basic liberties and the constitutional foundations of German freedom. These are powerful arguments. But is he right? One is loath to criticise the Germans for their handling of this pandemic. They have done far better so far than the British, French, Dutch, Belgians, Spanish, or Italians - though not as well as the Koreans - and were quicker to contain the spread of the virus by testing at the GP level.My own view is that Merkel is closer to the mark and that her country - despite her advice - is in danger of making a serious mistake.There are epidemiologists and virologists lined up on each side. One of the early alarmists has thrown in the towel, arguing it is already too late to contain the virus and that the state should actively infect children and the young to accelerate herd immunity.Whether he is right will depend on the first reliable, extensive, and random antibody results. Germany has reduced the RO spread rate to 0.8 - below the holy grail figure of 1.0 - but hardliners say it is still not enough.Prof Michael Meyer-Hermann from the Helmholtz Centre for Infection Research, in Braunschweig, said the current number was a mirage, distorted by delayed reporting over the Easter week. He thinks the reproduction rate must fall to 0.2 or 0.3 to defeat the virus. ""Otherwise you will be walking a tightrope the whole time,"" he said.Prof Meyer-Hermann said an extra week of lockdown might inflict a lot of economic damage, but not nearly as much as a second lockdown three weeks later as outbreaks erupt again.Germany does not yet have the surveillance structure in place for Korean-style contact tracing.The government says the necessary smartphone app will not be available for another month. It is an open question whether East Asian methods can ever work in any case under German data protection laws. There is a national allergy to Big Brother measures - commendable at most times - linked to the trauma of the 1930s and the East German Stasi.The fact that Germany's case fatality death rate is 3.1pc (according to the Robert Koch Institute) suggests that it is missing at least two thirds of cases. Its testing may be good by UK or French standards, but it is still not good enough to manage a 1.0 RO rate in a stable fashion.Lockdown hawks cite parallels with the US flu pandemic in 1918. There were mass protests demanding an end to quarantine policies after the first wave began to subside - even to the point of San Francisco's ""anti-mask league"", so like today's uprising in Michigan. But premature relaxation led to a second, deadlier, wave a few weeks later. There were justifications for this in www.1918.No vaccine was coming. Countries had to build herd immunity. This time there are hopes of a fast-track vaccine by the autumn. We are learning more about antiviral treatment and clinical management every week. Delay infection by a few months and your survival chances are better.The Merkel view is that you pick your poison: either endure a hard lockdown until the job is done; or risk on-and-off lockdowns lasting much longer, vastly compounding the economic damage over time. Can governments keep shutting people up again and again with any hope of sustaining social consent? Doubtful.The Swedish experiment sheds less light on the complex trade-offs than many advocates claim. It relies mostly on voluntary compliance based on Nordic tradition - and abnormally high levels of single households - but there is still strict social distancing.State epidemiologist Anders Tegnell - a cult hero to some, a misguided ideologue to others - may be vindicated if he is correct that Stockholm and other key regions are already near the threshold of herd immunity. A big ""if "". We are probably only in chapter one of this saga.The British government will not know the outcome of either the German or Swedish gambles in time to make its crucial decision on the exit strategy. The signs are that Boris Johnson is resisting calls from his own ""Laschet"" faction for premature www.lift-off.No 10 has been terrorised by the real possibility Britain will emerge with Europe's highest per capita death rate, with grim reputational damage to nation, government, and party.It now has the loser's advantage of humility and political fear. A stoic UK with remarkable unity behind the NHS may be patient enough to resist temptation. It may be disciplined enough to handle the next phase of this pandemic tolerably well - by comparison at least. Fingers crossed.Along-standing favourite in my family when I was growing up was a Victorian board game called The Prince's Quest, A Fairy Race Game, a battered edition of which I still have in my possession.In this simple snakes and ladders type game, each player embarks on a different route to a common end destination, where a sleeping beauty awaits the first to get there. But along the way he is repeatedly beset by good and bad fortune, depending on which number he lands on.The game is a good analogy for the fight against Covid-19. One moment, the end seems in sight; yet the next move dashes the player's hopes. Apparent progress is quashed by repeated setbacks.Yet the Prince's Quest board also carries a warning; ""The race is not always to the swift, nor the battle to the strong"", and that may well end up the case with Covid-19, too.Those that appear to be doing well now, and are therefore tempted into lifting lockdowns prematurely, may in time regret it. Singapore, widely praised at the start of the outbreak for its containment measures, but now experiencing some of the highest per capita infection rates in the world, may be a case in point. China too, where there appears to be a second outbreak in the northern city of Harbin.In the UK, the response to Covid-19 was initially instructed by the idea of herd immunity and reluctance impose economically destructive social distancing measures.

""In addition, immediate and long-term social mal msocial and economic consequences must be taken into account for future decisions"".In starting to ease restrictions, Merkel seems to have taken these economic considerations on board.Meanwhile, several states in the US, with the apparent support of the president, are lifting restrictions before waiting to see if the pandemic is under control. It'll be a while before we know whether these are the right decisions, but what seems clear to me is that at some stage similar risks are going to have to be taken here in the UK if we are to avoid the complete desertification of our economy.Vaccines are still plainly some distance off, so for now we are going to have to learn to live with the virus, even if it results in a second wave. As it is, we must reconcile ourselves to some restrictions remaining in place for a long time. At best, we can expect only a gradual removal, dashing hopes of an early V-shaped recovery in the economy.There is also likely to be some permanent damage even after the disease has burnt itself out, as all pandemics eventually do. The longer the restrictions persist, the deeper this damage is likely to be.Towards the end of The Prince's Quest, there are some really nasty squares you can land on, one of which sends you more than halfway back to the start. There is also the possibility of getting endlessly trapped and never completing the journey at all - so close, and yet so far.Let us hope the Germans know what they are doing. These are difficult choices, but we cannot just sit there and watch our economies burn.",Newspaper

Your iPhone or Android apps 'reveal if you're stressed, tidy or a party animal'","                     THE apps you keep on your phone can show if you're stressed, have a tidy home or if you're a bit of a party animal, it has emerged.                   They can also provide a host of other insights into your state of mind, your outlook on life and your motivations, a leading psychologist has revealed.It comes after a poll of 2,000 smartphone users found 44 per cent of people believe you can learn a lot about someone based on how their phone is organised.Dr Linda Papadopoulos, who is working with investment app eToro, believes having apps impeccably ordered into neat folders mean you are unlikely to have piles of dirty washing, mounting layers of dust or grimy surfaces in your home.You're also more likely to be someone who seeks out order and is comforted by clear rules and goals.Those aged 34 and under are most likely to organise their apps into folders, therefore finding comfort in order on their device.On the other hand, a chaotic mishmash of both work and leisure apps may mean you're feeling the pressure and struggling to separate your home life from your career.Those most likely to struggle with separating their work from their personal life are aged 35-44, with nearly a quarter saying they use their phone equally for business and pleasure.However, a messy phone could also indicate you're more care-free in nature, possibly more creative and that you have a higher tolerance for uncertainty.Women were found to be the most carefree, with 46 per cent admitting they don't arrange their apps at all, along with 62 per cent of those aged over 55.Dr Linda said: ""eToro's research provides a fascinating insight into the behaviours people have around their phones.""Many see their phones as a reflection of themselves through how they use their phones and also their app choices.""Phones are now so much more than a communication device and have become crucial in our daily lives.""So much can be done from your phone, so it's interesting to analyse the value of what you're doing with the time spent on your phone.""Those surveyed, in the poll commissioned by eToro, had an average of 36 apps on their phone and believe social networking, music and finance apps are the ones they would most struggle to live without.WhatsApp came out as the most used app followed by Facebook and Facebook messenger.YouTube, Instagram and Google Search were also highly used by respondents.But 82 per cent also find comfort in apps that keep them up to date on all aspects of their life from their finances to social connections.Financial apps are considered key, with more than one in five having an investment app on their phone such as eToro, Revolut, Hargreaves Lansdown or Moneybox.It also emerged saving money is a popular use of apps for 49 per cent, while half use them to spend cash.And nearly a quarter would be more inclined to invest money if this was easy through an app.But reliance on phone apps has increased for many with 41 per cent using them more than ever since the coronavirus lockdown.Iqbal V. Gandham, managing director of eToro UK said: ""This insight reinforces just how vital apps are to our daily lives.""Ease of use and quick access to the information we want is key to the success of any app - things we've actively looked to include in the eToro app.""Taking much of the behavioural insights on board from the research, we're confident apps can play a part in people's daily life now more than ever, including everything from ordering food deliveries to making investing feel more accessible.""To find out more, head to Etoro.In other news, find out which ""cheaper"" iPhone you should buy.These secret iPhone codewords will trigger hidden effects for your pals if you send them over iMessage.Find out how to play YouTube music in the background on iPhone and Android.And here's an easy guide on how to record your iPhone screen without using any apps.What do you think your apps say about you?

429,"How long will the UK coronavirus lockdown last?;Dominic Raab has extended UK lockdown for a further three weeks and said restrictions will not be lifted until changes can be ""safely"" made","April 22, 2020 Wednesday",International,telegraph.co.uk,1100,1100,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,"By Sarah Knapton, Science Editor","How long will the UK coronavirus lockdown last?Dominic Raab has extended UK lockdown for a further three weeks and said restrictions will not be lifted until changes can be ""safely"" made","The Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab has extended UK lockdown measures for a further three weeks to prevent the spread of Covid-19. The announcement on Thursday 16 April comes hours after Mr Raab chaired a Cobra meeting to discuss the current social restrictions in place.The extension has been put in place for ""at least"" three weeks which will take the UK to May 7, when we can expect a second review.Mr Raab, who is deputising for Boris Johnson, said the Government was being ""as open as we responsibly can at this stage"". ""It would not be responsible to prejudge the evidence that Sage will have and review in just a few weeks' time.""The Foreign Secretary said the Government carefully followed what is happening in other countries but ""we've got to do what is right for the British people based on the advice of our experts, grounded in the conditions prevailing here in the UK"".He said that measures put in place had been successful but that SAGE said that some settings were still seeing infections spreading.He warned that relaxing social restrictions now would damage economy in the longterm.•: How other countries are ending lockdown                     Is lockdown working?                     Less than 12 hours after the Prime Minister's historic address to the nation on March 23, the London Underground was jammed with commuters (see video below), while builders were seen eating together in communal canteens, making a mockery of the Government's rule that no more than two people can gather together in public.Professor Susan Michie, Director of the University College London's Centre for Behaviour Change, warned that some people would simply not be able to carry out the measures, even if they wanted to.""Five million self-employed people are being left potentially destitute by the Government failing to offer financial supportas they have done for directly employed workers,"" she said. ""Since [statutory sick pay of] £94 is not enough to pay rent, bills, food for a family etc, they will be forced to carry on as usual.""The British Transport Police is now on hand to make sure only            critical workers are using the London Underground. But such an inauspicious start to the lockdown suggests the virus will spread further than it would have, had stricter measures been implemented earlier,            as they have in other countries. And it means that the measures we do have are likely to be in place for longer to ""flatten the curve"" in a way that would prevent a second dangerous peak.In addition, on April 1 the Government revealed figures that suggested the lockdown was starting to fray as data showed an ""uptick""            in the number of people using transport.The number of those using their cars and public transport, which had been consistently dropping since strict social distancing measures were introduced, rose for the first time.It is feared that sunny weather will prompt more people to break the rules and go outside to socialise as boredom kicks in.•: Can I go for a drive during lockdown?How long will lockdown last?Mr Raab said the Government needed to be satisfied of five things before it would consider it safe to adjust any of the current measures:•Protect the NHS's ability to cope and be confident that the NHS is able to provide sufficient critical care across the UK.•See a sustained and consistent fall in daily death rates to be confident the UK is beyond the peak.•Reliable data from Sage showing rate of infection is decreasing to manageable levels across the board.•Confident that testing capacity and PPE are in hand with supply able to meet future demand.•Confident that any adjustments to the current measures would not risk a second peak in infections which would overwhelm the NHS.When the lockdown was first announced, Professor Mark Woolhouse, Professor of Infectious Disease Epidemiology, University of Edinburgh, said: ""We now enter a phase of careful monitoring. We are looking for indicators first that the epidemic is slowing down and then for numbers of new cases to start to fall. ""After three weeks we will have to decide whether the restrictions need to be continued, can be relaxed, or can be relaxed temporarily with the expectation of imposing them again later. ""We must also monitor the damage that the lockdown is doing; damage to the economy, to education, to psychological well-being and to health and social care provision in the community. The impacts of this epidemic are too far reaching for policy decisions to be driven by epidemiology alone.""Professor Sheila Bird said that more cases in coming weeks would make it easier for the Government to predict how the epidemic is responding to lockdown measures, which will inform how long they remain in place. ""Once an epidemic takes hold, as now in UK, the country's own data - properly reported and interpreted - take precedence over modelling as the data tell us the actual toll which the epidemic is exacting,"" she said.""A huge amount can be inferred about the immediately forthcoming weeks from these data directly, including whether further policy changes are needed to reinforce social-distancing; for example in particular age groups.""Some experts are still concerned that the current restrictions do not go far enough while others say the government has been hit by an ""epidemic of action"", and is now bringing in measures that have little rationale. Professor Robert Dingwall, Professor of Sociology, at Nottingham Trent University, wrote in The Telegraph: ""It is another triumph of populism over science, of a capitulation to the demand to 'do something'. ""We are still seeing some notion that 'the people' are selfish and must be bullied and disciplined. ""The people are not selfish; they have behaved in ways that are individually rational but have collectively irrational results.""However Dr Andrea Collins, Senior Clinical Lecturer in Respiratory Medicine at the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine (LSTM), said: ""I believe that they have not quite gone far enough. The 'absolutely' necessary to go to work is still being used by some when it is not required-I think we need permits across controlled areas to go to a workplace.""Recent modelling from the universities of Exeter, Bristol and Warwick suggested that without any measures at all, the epidemic would have peaked around 133 days after first person-to-person transmission in Britain, which happened around February 28. So the lockdown has the potential of curtailing the spread by around seven weeks. A welcome relief for people who could have been facing lockdown for most of the summer.",Newspaper; Web Publication
430,Masks may become the norm in shops and on public transport;Protection,"April 22, 2020 Wednesday",International,The Daily Telegraph (London),366,366,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,Amy Jones,Masks may become the norm in shops and on public transportProtection,"PEOPLE could be asked to wear masks in shops and on public transport as part of an easing of lockdown measures, a government adviser has suggested.Susan Michie, who sits on a subgroup of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), said that wearing face coverings could be ""helpful"" to protect workers in certain settings.She said: ""People working in shops or on public transport are likely to come into very frequent contact with people, some of whom may be infected.""Wearing masks in those situations would be to protect the driver or shopkeeper. I think there's certainly an argument there."" However, she insisted there is still ""no good evidence"" to suggest the general population should be wearing masks.The Sage committee met yesterday to discuss the issue.Speaking at last night's press conference, Matt Hancock indicated no decision had yet been made on whether to change official guidelines. The Health Secretary said he looked forward to hearing the findings from the Sage meeting, and insisted ministers would make ""decisions based on the science"".Jonathan Van-Tam, the Deputy Chief Medical Officer for England, said that the Government would not advocate wearing masks if it risked depleting critical supplies. He said: ""Sage places great value and prime importance on never jeopardising the supplies of PPE to our health and social care workers. That is a line we're not going to cross under any circumstances."" When Downing Street was asked about such fears, the Prime Minister's spokesman said: ""It doesn't take a scientist or a doctor to work out that it would be a very bad thing to happen.""Prof Michie, a professor of health psychology at University College London, echoed that sentiment. She insisted that any change in policy would need to be coupled with a ""very active campaign"", adding: ""There is a concern that people may feel too safe in them, raising concerns over whether they will practise social distancing and wash their hands properly.""The UK advice has remained in line with the World Health Organisation, but Dr David Nabarro, the group's special envoy, has said he believes that ""some form of facial protection is going to become the norm"" across society.",Newspaper
431,"UK urged to follow Europe's lead in expanding bike lanes to help with social distancing;Paris, Milan and Berlin among cities to introduce new bicycle lanes to help stop crowding on public transport","April 23, 2020 Thursday",International,telegraph.co.uk,671,671,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,"By Emma Gatten, environment editor","UK urged to follow Europe's lead in expanding bike lanes to help with social distancingParis, Milan and Berlin among cities to introduce new bicycle lanes to help stop crowding on public transport","The UK is being urged to follow in the footsteps of several European cities by expanding cycle and pedestrian networks to make it easier to move around during the pandemic. Cities are looking for ways to avoid public transport becoming crowded hotspots for the virus as people begin to go back to work. Paris has announced it will spend (EURO)300m (£260m) on a temporary network of bicycle lanes that roughly follow the capital's train lines to ease pressure on its metro as France lifts its lockdown from May 11. It follows an ambitious plan in Milan to reallocate 22 miles of its streets from car use to cycle and walking lanes. Meanwhile, Brussels has declared its city centre a pedestrian and cyclist priority zone, and Berlin has introduced 'pop-up' bike lanes. In the UK, the government has temporarily made it easier for local councils to close roads to car traffic, but so far there has been minimal take-up. Edinburgh and Glasgow have announced plans for temporary bike lanes, while Brighton has closed parts of its road space along the seafront to cars, and Cardiff has imposed a 20mph limit in one of the busier areas. Charity Cycling UK is writing to all council leaders to urge them to create more cycle lanes and close residential roads to cars to give people more space to stay safe. ""By and large they haven't been very imaginative, especially not like what we've seen in Europe,"" said Chris Todd, the director of Transport Action Network, which has threatened legal action against the government over its road-building plans. ""It doesn't seem like we've grasped the opportunity to help people.""Research has found that commuters on public transport are up to six times more likely to pick up an infection during a flu outbreak and the World Health Organisation recommends people ride a bike or walk ""whenever feasible"" to limit the spread of the virus. Cycling in the UK was up nearly 40 per cent last weekend compared to the six weeks before the lockdown, according to transport data analysts Vivacity, and Will Norman, London's walking and cycling commissioner, said there had been a significant increase in the number of people cycling for essential journeys. Mr Norman said the Greater London Authority was looking at its road network to see where more space could be made for bikes and pedestrians.Governments wary of gridlock and air pollution will also be keen to avoid replicating the surge in private car use seen in China since their lockdown eased, as residents avoid public transport. Several studies have shown a link between air pollution connected to car exhausts and respiratory illnesses that could exacerbate the impact of Covid-19.More than half of Brits have noticed the benefits of cleaner air as car use has dropped off, according to a survey by YouGov. Central London has seen a 40 per cent drop in nitrogen dioxide, the mayor's office said on Thursday. ""To maintain social distancing and not use public transport is basically a decision between private cars and active travel,"" said Adam Briggs, an associate clinical professor and honorary consultant in public health at Warwick Medical School. ""Cities will grind to a half if everyone gets in their car to go to work, not to mention the huge implications for air pollution and health, therefore walking and cycling has to be prioritised."" The pandemic may have accelerated a growing movement towards cycle and pedestrian-friendly cities, said Pierre Dornier, a clean air campaigner at Brussels-based NGO Transport and Environment. London already operates an ultra low emissions zone, while Brighton, York and Bristol are among other cities considering car-free areas. ""The soil was ready for this to happen. But this urban rearrangement couldn't have happened so quickly without the crisis,"" he said. Nick Chater, a professor of behavioural science at the University of Warwick said lockdown was an opportunity ""to think seriously about some rapid and radical changes to how roads are used-changes that would normally not be possible.""",Newspaper; Web Publication

The announcement on Thursday 16 April comes hours after Mr Raab chaired a Cobra meeting to discuss the current social restrictions in place.The extension has been put in place for ""at least"" three weeks which will take the UK to May 7, when we can expect a second review.Mr Raab, who is deputising for Boris Johnson, said the Government was being ""as open as we responsibly can at this stage"". ""It would not be responsible to prejudge the evidence that Sage will have and review in just a few weeks' time.""The Foreign Secretary said the Government carefully followed what is happening in other countries but ""we've got to do what is right for the British people based on the advice of our experts, grounded in the conditions prevailing here in the UK"".He said that measures put in place had been successful but that SAGE said that some settings were still seeing infections spreading.He warned that relaxing social restrictions now would damage economy in the longterm.•: How other countries are ending lockdown                     Is lockdown working?                     Less than 12 hours after the Prime Minister's historic address to the nation on March 23, the London Underground was jammed with commuters (see video below), while builders were seen eating together in communal canteens, making a mockery of the Government's rule that no more than two people can gather together in public.Professor Susan Michie, Director of the University College London's Centre for Behaviour Change, warned that some people would simply not be able to carry out the measures, even if they wanted to.""Five million self-employed people are being left potentially destitute by the Government failing to offer financial supportas they have done for directly employed workers,"" she said. ""Since [statutory sick pay of] £94 is not enough to pay rent, bills, food for a family etc, they will be forced to carry on as usual.""The British Transport Police is now on hand to make sure only            critical workers are using the London Underground. But such an inauspicious start to the lockdown suggests the virus will spread further than it would have, had stricter measures been implemented earlier,            as they have in other countries. And it means that the measures we do have are likely to be in place for longer to ""flatten the curve"" in a way that would prevent a second dangerous peak.In addition, on April 1 the Government revealed figures that suggested the lockdown was starting to fray as data showed an ""uptick""            in the number of people using transport.The number of those using their cars and public transport, which had been consistently dropping since strict social distancing measures were introduced, rose for the first time.It is feared that sunny weather will prompt more people to break the rules and go outside to socialise as boredom kicks in.•: Can I go for a drive during lockdown?How long will lockdown last?Mr Raab said the Government needed to be satisfied of five things before it would consider it safe to adjust any of the current measures:•Protect the NHS's ability to cope and be confident that the NHS is able to provide sufficient critical care across the UK.•See a sustained and consistent fall in daily death rates to be confident the UK is beyond the peak.•Reliable data from Sage showing rate of infection is decreasing to manageable levels across the board.•Confident that testing capacity and PPE are in hand with supply able to meet future demand.•Confident that any adjustments to the current measures would not risk a second peak in infections which would overwhelm the NHS.When the lockdown was first announced, Professor Mark Woolhouse, Professor of Infectious Disease Epidemiology, University of Edinburgh, said: ""We now enter a phase of careful monitoring. We are looking for indicators first that the epidemic is slowing down and then for numbers of new cases to start to fall. ""After three weeks we will have to decide whether the restrictions need to be continued, can be relaxed, or can be relaxed temporarily with the expectation of imposing them again later. ""We must also monitor the damage that the lockdown is doing; damage to the economy, to education, to psychological well-being and to health and social care provision in the community. The impacts of this epidemic are too far reaching for policy decisions to be driven by epidemiology alone.""Professor Sheila Bird said that more cases in coming weeks would make it easier for the Government to predict how the epidemic is responding to lockdown measures, which will inform how long they remain in place. ""Once an epidemic takes hold, as now in UK, the country's own data - properly reported and interpreted - take precedence over modelling as the data tell us the actual toll which the epidemic is exacting,"" she said.""A huge amount can be inferred about the immediately forthcoming weeks from these data directly, including whether further policy changes are needed to reinforce social-distancing; for example in particular age groups.""Some experts are still concerned that the current restrictions do not go far enough while others say the government has been hit by an ""epidemic of action"", and is now bringing in measures that have little rationale. Professor Robert Dingwall, Professor of Sociology, at Nottingham Trent University, wrote in The Telegraph: ""It is another triumph of populism over science, of a capitulation to the demand to 'do something'. ""We are still seeing some notion that 'the people' are selfish and must be bullied and disciplined. ""The people are not selfish; they have behaved in ways that are individually rational but have collectively irrational results.""However Dr Andrea Collins, Senior Clinical Lecturer in Respiratory Medicine at the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine (LSTM), said: ""I believe that they have not quite gone far enough. The 'absolutely' necessary to go to work is still being used by some when it is not required-I think we need permits across controlled areas to go to a workplace.""Recent modelling from the universities of Exeter, Bristol and Warwick suggested that without any measures at all, the epidemic would have peaked around 133 days after first person-to-person transmission in Britain, which happened around February 28. So the lockdown has the potential of curtailing the spread by around seven weeks. A welcome relief for people who could have been facing lockdown for most of the summer.",Newspaper; Web Publication
433,"Change thinking, save lives': can Rio's nudge unit halt coronavirus?;Behavioural science is being used to tackle some of Brazil's biggest challenges, from the pandemic to extreme weatherCoronavirus - latest updatesSee all our coronavirus coverage","April 24, 2020 Friday",International,The Guardian (London),1026,1026,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,Sarah Johnson,"Change thinking, save lives': can Rio's nudge unit halt coronavirus?Behavioural science is being used to tackle some of Brazil's biggest challenges, from the pandemic to extreme weatherCoronavirus - latest updatesSee all our coronavirus coverage","Brazil has been the Latin American country hardest-hit so far by the coronavirus pandemic, with many fearing that deaths from Covid-19 are rocketing well beyond the            2,588 officially recorded so far.  The situation is particularly dire for the millions of Brazilians living in densely populated favelas where physical distancing is almost impossible. But Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro            doesn't seem to be taking concerns over the           virus seriously, accusing the media of ""hysteria"". And he            has clashed with Rio de Janeiro's governor, Wilson Witzel, who has            ordered the state's 17 million citizens to stay at home - and off the city's beaches.Helping in the effort to keep people safe and away from public areas is NudgeRio, a department in Rio's city hall that uses behavioural science to influence people's decisions. The team has helped produce messages to encourage people to stay at home, including a photograph of Sugar Loaf mountain with accompanying text that reads: ""Rio's landscape gives the hint. Let's flatten the curve.""For the past week, city hall has been sending           drones around the city with audio messages, created by NudgeRio, to remind people to avoid crowded areas and to wash their hands. ""We have produced three messages so far, but will be doing more,"" says Jose Moulin Netto, who set up NudgeRio in 2018. The team is also involved in a project to combat growing domestic violence, a global problem exacerbated by lockdown situations. Moulin says the team is considering developing an app with a panic button for women, as well as one for men to deter them from committing acts of violence.The nudge theory was put forward in a 2008 book of the same name by economist Richard Thaler and political scientist Cass Sunstein. One of Thaler's insights is that people do not always behave in their own best interests. From this, he developed an argument that nuanced changes can trigger desirable shifts in behaviour for individuals and society.Former UK prime minister David Cameron was a fan and in 2010 set up the first nudge unit, the Cabinet Office behavioural insights team.            Its successes include sending letters to British GPs who were prescribing more than their peers, cutting unnecessary prescriptions by 3.3%.The UK government's early response to the pandemic was thought to be largely influenced by the behavioural insights team. But this was subsequently changed and, as Tony Yates, a former professor of economics at Birmingham University,            pointed out in early March, the UK strategy was an outlier: ""If the nudgers have got it right, why are so many other countries taking a very different view of the 'science'?""Before coronavirus took hold, the four permanent members of the Rio team were working onchanging messaging to tackle flooding. In April 2019, Rio de Janeiro recorded its worst level of rainfall in 22 years, with storms that left 10 people dead. Monsoon rains impact poorer communities worst, especially those in favelas on steep hillsides. This year alone,            about 150           Brazilians have been killed or are missing following heavy rains, landslides and flooding. Summer in the city is always ""problematic"", according to Thais Miguelino, a spokeswoman for the Rio operations centre that monitors traffic, accidents and weather and manages crisis situations, including the pandemic. ""We need to know how to communicate with people so they know what they need to do,"" she says. ""The idea is to change people's thinking so we can save lives.""The centre wants to work out how best to use its social media channels to communicate messages that will encourage people to stay put and avoid travel during a storm, or advise them how to get to a place of safety. To do this, NudgeRio has created different personas, including a mother with a baby and an older person, and seen how they might react to events such as flooding or a landslide.""The rain in Rio is unpredictable and varies according to which region of the city you're in,"" explains Rafaela Bastos, a member of the NudgeRio team. ""It's very important that the population knows how to take decisions in certain situations, to be prepared and reflect on what to do with the information available."" Other NudgeRio projects relate to tax collection, school registration and reducing jaywalking and have led to savings. But the team faces challenges getting people to take nudge seriously and proving the impact of projects. ""It's hard to convince people and to get employees involved,"" admits Moulin. Innovation in the public sector is always a challenge, he adds: ""The public sector has to abide by certain rules. There are very specific definitions of what you can do. It's so much harder.""There has also been criticism of the nudge approach. Sometimes it's seen as a sticking plaster for gaping holes in public services that need more investment. Rio's summer weather, for instance, has always been unpredictable, yet the same problems keep reappearing, suggesting a more structural approach is required. Moulin and the NudgeRio team acknowledge the pitfalls but remain excited by the potential impact. They cite a project with the city's education department as an example. Every two years, the Brazilian government holds a national exam to measure the academic performance of public school students aged 10-11 and 14-15, with a mock test a month beforehand. Last year NudgeRio was asked to try to increase participation and students' grades.On the eve of the mock exam, the department of education sent an inspirational message from the education secretary, for parents to pass on to their children the following morning. The result? On average, grades rose by 4.1%. ""I can't emphasise it enough,"" says Moulin. ""This message was sent at 7.30pm in the evening on the day before the exam and yet there was a significant increase in grades. I still get goosebumps when I think about it.""

He said: ""Neither of us have any problem in principle with the names being made public.""However, Sir Patrick has separately told MPs that disclosing the list of Sage members could leave them vulnerable to outside lobbying interests. The Daily Telegraph has found that a number of those on the committee and its sub-committees already have links to pharmaceutical firms that could be perceived as conflicts of interests.                     Who is on the SAGE committee?                   Those on the SAGE committee include Professor John Edmunds, an epidemiologist at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM) who sits on Sage as well as two of its sub-committees. His partner Jeanne Pimenta works for the pharmaceutical giant GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) and also holds shares in the company. Prof Edmunds said that his partner had recently resigned from GSK and was working out her notice.Others on Sage include Professor Graham Medley, also at LSHTM, Peter Horby, Professor of Emerging Infectious Diseases and Global Health at the University of Oxford, Neil Ferguson, mathematical modeller at Imperial College, Dr Jim McMenamin of Health Protection Scotland, Sharon Peacock, the director of the National Infection Service at Public Health England, and Ian Diamond, the head of the Government Statistical Service.•​Who is on the SAGE committeeSir Patrick claimed in a letter to MPs that the government does not disclose membership of Sage partly to protect ""them from lobbying and other forms of unwanted influence which may hinder their ability to give impartial advice.""Sir Patrick's warning was apparently intended as a defence of the Government's decision not to disclose the scientists' names, but it backfired on Friday as MPs warned that this was all the more reason for the list of members to be subjected to public scrutiny.Chi Onwurah, the Shadow Science Minister, said: ""There will already be lobbying going on and the response to lobbying is greater transparency, not less. We are calling for the people who make up Sage to be known and for Sage's advice to be shared with the Opposition.""Lord O'Donnell, the long-serving former Cabinet Secretary, told the BBC Today programme, ""We always used to publish membership of ministerial committees. I don't see any reason why we can't list the people [on Sage]. I've no idea if they've got the right amount of experts round the table.""Sir David King, the former Chief Scientific Adviser, added, ""I do not see or understand the secrecy around who the science adviser is getting advice from.""I think it would be so important to gain the trust of the public by acting openly. It's very simple, but at the moment we are not privy to the discussions.""I think I can't help feeling that the Chief Scientific Adviser and the Chief Medical Officer are under political pressure not to be frank with the public. I think that's the bottom line.""Professor Whitty told MPs on the Science and Technology select committee on Friday that he and Sir Patrick had no objection themselves to the names being released ""in principle"" but that the Centre for the Protection of National Infrastructure had said the names should not be disclosed.He said this was because some non Covid-19 meetings of Sage may occasionally involve matters of national security so ""the principle needed to be thought through quite carefully.""But the calls for transparency were echoed by several senior figures on Sage and its sub-committees - the very people the government claims it wants to ""protect"".They said it was ""counterproductive"" to keep their identities private, and that the Government should publish their names in order to shore up public trust.                     Threats from the public                   Professor Susan Michie, who has attended one Sage meeting and sits on the Scientific Pandemic Influenza Group on Behavioural Science, or ""SPI-B"" - one of four highly influential committees that feeds into SAGE, told the Telegraph that she has spoken out on the issue.""Given openness and transparency are important for trust and trust is important for adherence to Government advice, it makes sense to me to publish names and papers agreed by the committees in timely manner,"" she said.A few members told the Telegraph that they had faced threats from the public, and a couple said that as a result they preferred not to be named.However, others - such as Professor Robert Dingwall, who sits on the New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group (NERVTAG)-said they supported transparency regardless. ""I think as a matter of principle that membership of such advisory groups should be in the public domain.""Professor Whitty told the select committee y that ""all of the sub committees are extremely open.""But the Government has also repeatedly refused to disclose the membership of SPI-B or name the five members of the Covid-19 Clinical Information Network, another of the four sub-committees referred to as CO-CIN, which is kept so secret it is not even referred to on Sage's website.It does, however, publish the full membership of NERVTAG, along with register of interests.Prof Edmunds is one of those who fully disclosed his interests, including his partner's employment and shares, in the register when it was last updated in November 2018.It used to publish the membership of the Scientific Pandemic Influenza Group on Modelling - or SPI-M - but deleted the page three weeks ago.The lack of complete transparency has echoes of the way the World Health Organisation operated during the 2009 swine flu crisis, when it refused to disclose the names of the scientists it relied on for advice.At the time, critics raised fears that there may have been conflicts of interests that would have enabled pharmaceutical companies to influence decisions to buy up vast amounts of vaccines against the illness.However, WHO claimed that it had to keep the membership secret in order to protect them from undue pressure, and insisted that it had vetted them. In Britain, the Government spent more than £500million on supplies of two flu drugs-Tamiflu and Relenza - following WHO's recommendations, amid warnings that the UK death toll would reach 65,000. In the end it claimed around 450 lives.After the crisis was over, it emerged that five of the 15 scientists who sat on the emergency committee had previously received funding from pharmaceutical giants, or were linked to them through their research.Those specialists included Professor Neil Ferguson, the Imperial College modelling expert who sits on SAGE and two of its sub-committees, and whose coronavirus predictions led to the country's current lockdown.He had acted as a consultant for Roche, a drugs firm that manufactured Tamiflu, as well as Glaxo Smith Kline Biologicals until 2007.Another of the scientists named was Professor Maria Zambon, who now works for Public Health England and sits on NERVTAG.Her laboratory at the UK Health Protection Agency Centre for Infection had received funding from several vaccine makers, including Sanofi, Novartis, CSL, Baxter and GSK.The WHO said at the time that those interests ""do not give rise to a conflict of interest such that the experts concerned should be partially or totally excluded from participation in the Emergency Committee."" A government spokesperson said: ""During this crisis, the government has rightly consulted expert advisors with a wealth of academic, scientific, medical and private sector experience to tackle COVID-19 and save lives. It is wrong and unfair to those advisors to suggest that scientific knowledge and experience is being shared for any other reason than to aid the national effort to beat this virus.""The decision to not disclose SAGE membership is based upon advice from the Centre for the Protection of National Infrastructure and is in line with the standard procedure for COBR meetings, to which SAGE gives advice.""This is to safeguard individual members' personal security and protect them from lobbying and other forms of unwanted influence which may hinder their ability to give impartial advice. Of course, we do not stop individuals from revealing that they have attended SAGE.""A number 10 spokesperson said Mr Cummings had attended some SAGE meetings and listened to some meetings now they are all virtual.""He did this in order to understand better the scientific debates concerning this emergency and also to understand better the limits of how science and data can help government decisions.""SAGE provides independent scientific advice to the government. Political advisers have no role in this. ""From the start the government has tried hard to integrate scientific advice into its decision making in a sensible way. It will continue to do so.""",Newspaper; Web Publication
435,Case for transparency over Sage has never been clearer;Emergency response body could have moved quicker at beginning of pandemicRevealed: Cummings on secret Sage bodyWho's who on Sage?See all our coronavirus coverage,"April 24, 2020 Friday",International,The Guardian (London),644,644,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,Ian Sample Science editor,Case for transparency over Sage has never been clearerEmergency response body could have moved quicker at beginning of pandemicRevealed: Cummings on secret Sage bodyWho's who on Sage?See all our coronavirus coverage,"As the coronavirus epidemic spilled out of China and seeded outbreaks around the world, the British government looked to its Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) for guidance on how best to handle the crisis.The members of Sage are not a fixed group of wise academics that wait in their offices for the hotline to ring. The makeup of the group depends on the emergency at hand and is put together at the request of the Cabinet Office. At its best, it gives ministers direct access to the finest minds in the country as it navigates an unfolding emergency.                     Sage comprises two dozen or so experts. Today, two-thirds are men. Some members are there to share advice from more specialised sub-groups. During the coronavirus pandemic they include the Scientific Pandemic Influenza Group on Modelling, or SPI-M, made up of outbreak modellers from Imperial, Edinburgh and the London School of Hygiene and Tropic Medicine among others.Then there are the behavioural scientists who feed into Sage via the Scientific Pandemic Influenza Group on Behavioural Science, or SPI-B. Another group that has a representative on Sage is the New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group, or Nervtag, home to the virologists and respiratory disease specialists who study the pathogens and their effects on the body.The combined expertise, with senior medics, social scientists and outbreak specialists, is intended to ensure that all aspects of the unfolding pandemic, from the nature of the virus, to how people will react, are covered. Yet while Sage covers the academic bases, it is unclear whether it has the breadth of voices it needs. Could there have been more in the room, for example, who knew an emergency when they saw one?More than a month ago, Michael Ryan, the World Health Organization's head of emergencies, made it abundantly clear that governments had to act fast to beat the virus. ""The virus will always get you if you don't move quickly and you need to be prepared,"" he said. Speaking from experience with Ebola outbreaks, Ryan went on to add: ""Anyone who's involved in emergency response will know this.""Britain did not move fast and was not prepared. As Jeremy Farrar, director of the Wellcome Trust, one of the few members of Sage who is open about his membership, has warned, Britain            could have Europe's worst death toll.It is hard to look at the list and not feel it needs more mathematical modellers or more statisticians. Those disciplines are crucial for pulling in data and working out how the virus is spreading, who it is killing and in what numbers.They are crucial too for cautiously predicting the future course of the disease, which in turn is needed to work out plausible exit strategies and give early warning of a second peak.But what mattered at the start of the epidemic was to move fast, not wait until models revealed the spectacular death toll the country faced if sat on its hands.It is not the only area where expertise appears to be lacking. Sage is not responsible for all of the government's advice: it goes to Cobra where ministers weigh it up against other considerations.But beyond the clear failure to act fast, two areas that have defined Britain's ham-fisted response to the coronavirus pandemic are the inability to test at scale and devastating shortcomings in supplies of personal protective equipment (PPE).Where are the experts that could have organised companies to ramp up testing sooner, as is only now coming online? And who would have looked at the PPE stockpile and where the equipment had to go and seen a thorny problem that needed swift and decisive action?The members of Sage are impressive individuals. But with the government insisting it is following the science, as if science offers only one route through this, the case for transparency has never been clearer.",Newspaper

The inclusion of Downing Street advisers on Sage will raise questions about the independence of its scientific advice.There has been growing pressure on Downing Street in recent days to disclose more details about the group, which provides scientific advice to the upper echelons of government during emergencies. Both the membership of Sage and its advice to ministers on the Covid-19 outbreak is being kept secret.Warner, a data scientist, was reportedly recruited to Downing Street last year by Cummings after running the Conservative party's general election campaign model. He is also said to have worked closely with Cummings on the data modelling used in the Vote Leave campaign for the UK to leave the European Union.The government's former chief scientific adviser Sir David King said he was ""shocked"" to discover there were political advisers on Sage. ""If you are giving science advice, your advice should be free of any political bias,"" he said. ""That is just so critically important.""Told that Cummings was in the 23 March meeting, King replied: ""Oh my goodness. Isn't this maybe why they don't want us to know who was there?""King said political advisers were never on the equivalent committees of Sage when he chaired them and argued that Cummings, who is not a scientist, could report his own interpretation of Sage advice back to the prime minister.Other former members of Sage also said they could not recall political appointees being on previous committees. David Lidington, a former Cabinet Office minister and de facto deputy to Theresa May when she was prime minister, said: ""I'm not aware of any minister or special adviser, certainly not in Theresa May's time, ever having been involved in the scientific advisory panels.""In a statement provided by Downing Street, a government spokesperson said: ""Expert participants often vary for each meeting according to which expertise is required. A number of representatives from government departments and No 10 attend also.""Late on Friday, Downing Street released a second statement. ""It is not true that Mr Cummings or Dr Warner are 'on' or members of Sage. Mr Cummings and Dr Warner have attended some Sage meetings and listen to some meetings now they are all virtual. Occasionally they ask questions or offer help when scientists mention problems in Whitehall,"" a No 10 spokesman said.""Sage provides independent scientific advice to the government. Political advisers have no role in this,"" the spokesperson added. ""Public confidence in the media has collapsed during this emergency partly because of ludicrous stories such as this.""Downing Street declined to say how many Sage meetings Cummings and Warner attended, or whether any other political advisers took part.Sage participants told the Guardian the Downing Street advisers were not merely observing the advisory meetings, but actively participating in discussions about the formation of advice.In a letter to parliament this month, Sir Patrick Vallance, the UK government's chief scientific adviser, who chairs Sage, said the ""decision not to disclose"" membership of the committee was based on advice from the Centre for the Protection of National Infrastructure.""This contributes towards safeguarding individual members' personal security and protects them from lobbying and other forms of unwanted influence which may hinder their ability to give impartial advice,"" Vallance wrote. ""Of course, we do not stop individuals from revealing that they have attended Sage.""On Friday, England's chief medical officer, Prof Chris Whitty, appeared to signal a change in direction, saying the public had a right to know who sat on Sage. He told a Commons science select committee that while it was important to consider security concerns, there was ""absolutely no barrier"" from him or Vallance. Asked if in the current climate revealing the names of who was on the group would boost public confidence in the scientific advice being given, Whitty replied: ""Yes.""Several members on Sage, as well as scientists on its advisory subcommittees, are known to be frustrated at what they view as a culture of secrecy that risks straining public trust in the government's response to Covid-19.Since the outbreak, ministers have stuck to the script that their policies are guided by scientific advice, while declining to reveal where the advice is coming from or what exactly it contains.Other countries have been more open about the scientific evidence behind their decisions, and the UK's approach has raised eyebrows overseas.The New York Times reported on Thursday that Sage operates in ""a virtual black box"". ""Its list of members is secret, its meetings are closed, its recommendations are private and the minutes of its deliberations are published much later, if at all.""The Guardian understands that Sage first met for a precautionary meeting to discuss Covid-19 on 22 January, then again on 28 January. It met a further nine times in February, and 10 times in March. It is currently meeting around twice a week.It understood that while the chief medical officers and chief scientific advisers of the devolved administrations in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have been allowed to listen in on Sage meetings, they have been doing so as observers. Unlike Cummings and Warner, they were not allowed to ask questions, having to instead submit them in writing in advance.While core members of the committee, such as Whitty, attend all meetings, other clinical experts, scientists and epidemiologists do not attend every meeting, but can be asked in on a rotating basis to provide specific advice. Sage tends to be guided by specific questions that they are asked to consider by the Cabinet Office's emergency Cobra meetings.Other Sage participants at the 23 March meeting included Sharon Peacock, the director of the National Infection Service at Public Health England, and Ian Diamond, the head of the Government Statistical Service. Neil Ferguson, the Imperial College epidemiologist whose models have been central to government decision-making, was also present, along with fellow infectious disease specialists, Graham Medley and John Edmunds.Others attendees included Brooke Rogers, a professor of behavioural science at King's College - who also chairs the Cabinet Office's National Risk Assessment Behavioural Science Advisory Group - and James Rubin, also at King's, who chairs a Sage subcommittee that provides specific advice on behavioural science.However it is the inclusion of two Downing Street political advisers that will raise questions over whether the structure of the government's scientific advisory process is free from political interference.A source in Downing Street said that in March Cummings was playing a commanding role in responding to the Covid-19 outbreak. Cummings is understood to be close to Warner, whose brother, Marc, runs Faculty, an artificial intelligence company that the Guardian revealed is involved in an ""unprecedented"" data-mining operation as part of the government's response to the coronavirus outbreak.An accomplished data scientist, Ben Warner previously worked at his brother's AI company, which has teamed up with Palantir, the US data firm founded by the rightwing billionaire Peter Thiel, to consolidate UK government databases to help ministers respond to the pandemic.",Newspaper

Which is Latin for ""who lung-bleaches the lung bleachers?""The inquiry arises after Thursday's White House press conference, which saw Donald Trump offer his latest symposium on how to kill a country. ""I see the disinfectant where it knocks [the virus] out in a minute,"" he gibbered, live on national television. ""One minute! And is there a way we can do something like that, by injection inside, or almost a cleaning? ... So it'd be interesting to check that."" Wouldn't it? Let's pop it on the to-do list, right below ""staple our eyelids to the floor"". Another interesting thing to check would be the precise theoretical point at which deciding to ingest bleach becomes the tragically rational response to the fact that a sitting president is suggesting Americans ingest bleach. For now, though, let's just include the presidential caveat. Pointing to his head, Trump went on: ""I'm not a doctor. But I'm, like, a person that has a good you-know-what.""There we are, then. In the lockdown era, we've all been making do with long-forgotten tinned food and whatnot that we've found around the house. So it makes sense that the United States president would be coming up with the sort of stuff that Sauron or  Gwyneth Paltrow  would pull if they only had access to the cupboard under their kitchen sink.Even so, it is increasingly impossible to see Trump himself as anything other than a diagnostic agent, a sort of barium meal run through the system to test the strength of the US checks and balances. They are ... how to put this sufficiently plainly? ... failing. Indeed, the word failing itself feels like it's failing, given the sheer weight of deficiency and dereliction it is currently being required to bear.On Twitter, the platform to which Trump's you-know-what is fused, the news is panned daily for suggestions that someone - anyone - in anything approaching a position of power gets this. Every day brings another series of clips of public health officials, whose thousand-yard stares are turning into million-yard stares, and who are presumably too busy trying to protect a pandemic-stricken nation from the attentions of a quarterwit to source a Claus           von Stauffenberg costume. The Republican establishment - many of whom would have something serviceable already hanging in their locked closet - have long preferred to wear the mark of Cain.As have certain Trump media cheerleaders, who were apparently fine with all the racism and the pussy-grabbing, but today seem to have judged the Dettol chronicles the bit that might finally cause blowback to their own personages. I'm afraid all we can say to this is: DO ME A FAVOUR. Only grifters who spent years going ""Trump will surprise people"" are surprised by this. This is on them, too. Change sides now, by all means - better late than never - but do be aware that the historical record is always very clear on such switcheroos. Or to put it another way: Mussolini was, at all stages on his journey, a complete shit. You're Mussolini.In any case, Trump's handling of the Covid-19 crisis was always predictable pathologically. You're asking a man who got to the Oval Office by going viral to disavow a virus. It's not very surprising that Trump can't bring himself to. You have to think he recognises something of a kindred spirit in the disease, which is indifferent to all human suffering, impacts disproportionately on ethnic minorities and is horrifyingly resistant to therapy.In terms of behavioural science, then, perhaps the best way to encourage Trump to defeat the virus would be to make him professionally jealous of it. At present he just regards it as a supporting cast member, occupying the Apprentice boardroom-sidekick chair once held by that other disease particle, Don Jr. Or as the president put it this week in reference to his nightly press conferences that should ideally be guiding Americans on how not to die: ""I've had great 'ratings' my whole life, there's nothing unusual about that for me. The White House News Conference ratings are 'through the roof' (Monday Night Football, Bachelor Finale) ..."" Congratulations to the star, showrunner and executive producer for having the vision to deliver this thing. Then again, shows with high body counts have always rated highly on US TV.Back on our own shores, meanwhile, the one useful moment in the Trump press conference was the bit where he imparted some - any - information about Boris Johnson, who remains off games. As you may recall, Britain has not had a working prime minister for some weeks now, in a moment of maximum crisis. But there is a sense - fostered by some of the most obnoxious people on Earth - that it would somehow be uncouth to dwell on how or even if decisions are being made. Instead, we are led by a cabinet            rat king, with Dominic Raab's tail entwined with those of Matt Hancock, Michael Gove and Rishi Sunak. Eventually one of them - probably Sunak - will manage to bite off their own appendage to set themselves free. For now, the factions nip at each other off the record - and sometimes, at Johnson. ""The prime minister is in a funny place,"" ran            one kindly monstering a few days ago. ""I think he's quite frightened."" I bet you do.The one entity everyone wants you to think is in charge, though, is The Science. Of all the seven phrases of magnetic fridge poetry that are rearranged each day to fashion a 5pm briefing, the most ominous is surely "" We have, at all times, been led by the science."" This is untrue, no matter how many times they say it. We have, at all times, been led by the government, whose job it is to take the scientific advice and make political decisions based on it. The ministers do not, in fact, all work for ""The Science"", the most suspiciously shadowy overlord since            Keyser Söze.""The Science"" is not some monolithic stone tablet that gets handed to Raab to read out to the masses - and all scientists themselves know this. The claim that government would be ""led by the science"" was reassuring many weeks ago, at the start of all this. But now, through suspicious overuse to the exclusion of all other considerations, it has become troubling. Whenever some politician standing next to him says it these days, my overactive imagination fancies it sees a flicker behind the eyes of Chris Whitty. Is he realising that they are fitting him up to be the guy who needs at least 36 changes of shirt for the inevitable public inquiry? This week, some scientists advising the government told Buzzfeed they feared they will be used by ministers as ""human shields"" at such an event.Will they? You certainly wouldn't rule out Dominic Cummings's Downing Street believing they've alighted on the perfect way to insulate themselves from blame - using scientists as a prophylactic. Call it a nerd immunity strategy, and pour yourself a celebratory disinfectant. Marina Hyde is a Guardian columnist",Newspaper
439,"For this next phase, the government must give us more than a three-word mantra","April 24, 2020 Friday",International,telegraph.co.uk,1080,1080,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,By David Hunter,"For this next phase, the government must give us more than a three-word mantra","One does not have to be a scientist to understand there will be no single moment the lockdown ends. Most of us will still be susceptible to infection, waves of local lockdowns may be needed to prevent the hard-won gains being lost, and testing and contact tracing will have to be ramped up. There will be no quick return to business as usual. The latest YouGov poll shows that the public already understands this with 74% of people favouring a gradual loosening of restrictions. Surveys also show that we have been much more compliant with the lockdown than behavioral scientists and the politicians predicted.Having rightly decided that we should not see the NHS overwhelmed, there are only two possible futures until there is an effective treatment or vaccine. The first is to let the virus smoulder along, with the NHS able to cope with the resulting hospitalizations and deaths at a level compatible with resuming treatment of all the other health conditions; local flare-ups will need to be stamped out. The second is to go further and attempt to eliminate the virus in the UK, recognizing that permitting any international travel will result in at least occasional small outbreaks. Loosening the restrictions will be far more difficult than imposing them. Most people who can work from home should continue to do so. Those working in the most essential jobs where physical distancing is possible should go back to work first. People in less essential jobs where physical distancing is not possible may need to wait much longer. Children and teachers may have to maintain distance at school, with obvious implications for class size, play breaks, and methods of instruction. Temperatures will be checked at the factory gates or office entrance. Face coverings will be a new normal. Virus testing and contact tracing may be a condition of going to work. Congregating in pubs and restaurants, theatres and cinemas will be greatly limited. Mass gatherings will remain banned. Some of these steps will create economic winners and losers and risk social cohesion. However, these steps will lead to the first future. To get to elimination we will need to add saturation testing and isolation, and quarantine of international arrivals.Who will determine what happens next? We are told the government is ""following the science"". Was it the scientists that told us mass gatherings should go ahead, that shaking hands is fine, and that it was too late for testing and contact tracing? Or did the Government not take the scientists' advice? We cannot know because the background documents and recommendations of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (SAGE)            will be kept secret until after the pandemic.In an case, confronted with a new virus, it is unreasonably to pretend that even the best scientists can provide more than educated guesses. At this point in the pandemic the best guide for policies will be the experience of China, South Korea, Taiwan, Australia, New Zealand and other countries that appear to have contained the initial virus surge.What matters now are the decisions going forward, and communicating them to the public in a persuasive and factual manner. The first rule of public health communication in an epidemic is that maintaining the trust of the public is paramount. This was the hard-won lesson of the Ebola epidemics - when we ask people to change long-held social norms we have to do it through a process of community engagement and consultation, and explain the rationale for these measures in plain terms with transparent motivations. Transparency includes communicating the uncertainty involved in the scientific predictions.In the US, President Trump's daily ramblings make the UK briefings look like models of cogency. The leader who has been giving a masterclass in public health communications has been Andrew Cuomo, Governor of New York State. Similarly to the UK leadership he was caught short with a crisis that threatened to overwhelm the hospitals, but since then he has kept on the front foot.Now in his sixth week of consecutive daily press conferences, Cuomo lays out the facts, mixes in empathy and occasional humour, and has not shied away from looking ahead. He acknowledges the strengths and weaknesses of statistical models.More than a week ago he started preparing his audience for a staggered return to work based on job description and workplace risk. He realized that perfect scientific information can be the enemy of the good and ordered mandatory face covering when social distancing is not possible. On Thursday this week he revealed and interpreted the first results of antibody testing within a day of the tests. Most importantly, he prefers persuasion to proscription, and acknowledges that preparing the public takes time. The UK Government successfully galvanized us around the slogan ""Protect our NHS"". The next weeks and months will be much more difficult, and not so easily reduced to a three word mantra. Communities, and individuals, will be asked to maintain the lockdown while they see others partially released. There will be setbacks. People will only go along with this if they feel they are stakeholders in the larger enterprise, and they will do so voluntarily only if the logic, including the uncertainty, is transparent. If the slow initial response was partly due to a fear of looking like a ""Nanny State"", this is no time to treat us like infants who can't be trusted with the facts. Apparently, the Scots have a greater ability to absorb complex information, and Nicola Sturgeon has admirably shared her framework for decision making.As we approach the ""end of the beginning"" our Government needs to radically improve its communications strategy. In this first phase, one size fits all edicts have worked. As we ask people to change their lives in nuanced and variable ways, public debate, community representation, the experience of public health professionals, events in other countries, and transparency of decision-making must be given equal standing to SAGE. Uncertainty needs to be acknowledged. The messaging needs to move from beleaguered and proscriptive to candid and flexible. If not, we will lose the public trust, the advice will not be followed, and we will delay the ""beginning of the end"".                     David J.

Less than 12 hours after the Prime Minister's historic address to the nation on March 23, the London Underground was jammed with commuters (see video below), while builders were seen eating together in communal canteens, making a mockery of the Government's rule that no more than two people can gather together in public.Professor Susan Michie, Director of the University College London's Centre for Behaviour Change, warned that some people would simply not be able to carry out the measures, even if they wanted to.""Five million self-employed people are being left potentially destitute by the Government failing to offer financial supportas they have done for directly employed workers,"" she said. ""Since [statutory sick pay of] £94 is not enough to pay rent, bills, food for a family etc, they will be forced to carry on as usual.""The British Transport Police is now on hand to make sure only            critical workers are using the London Underground. But such an inauspicious start to the lockdown suggests the virus will spread further than it would have, had stricter measures been implemented earlier,            as they have in other countries. And it means that the measures we do have are likely to be in place for longer to ""flatten the curve"" in a way that would prevent a second dangerous peak.In addition, on April 1 the Government revealed figures that suggested the lockdown was starting to fray as data showed an ""uptick""            in the number of people using transport.The number of those using their cars and public transport, which had been consistently dropping since strict social distancing measures were introduced, rose for the first time.It is feared that sunny weather will prompt more people to break the rules and go outside to socialise as boredom kicks in.•: Can I go for a drive during lockdown?How long will lockdown last?Mr Raab said the Government needed to be satisfied of five things before it would consider it safe to adjust any of the current measures:•Protect the NHS's ability to cope and be confident that the NHS is able to provide sufficient critical care across the UK.•See a sustained and consistent fall in daily death rates to be confident the UK is beyond the peak.•Reliable data from Sage showing rate of infection is decreasing to manageable levels across the board.•Confident that testing capacity and PPE are in hand with supply able to meet future demand.•Confident that any adjustments to the current measures would not risk a second peak in infections which would overwhelm the NHS.When the lockdown was first announced, Professor Mark Woolhouse, Professor of Infectious Disease Epidemiology, University of Edinburgh, said: ""We now enter a phase of careful monitoring. We are looking for indicators first that the epidemic is slowing down and then for numbers of new cases to start to fall. ""After three weeks we will have to decide whether the restrictions need to be continued, can be relaxed, or can be relaxed temporarily with the expectation of imposing them again later. ""We must also monitor the damage that the lockdown is doing; damage to the economy, to education, to psychological well-being and to health and social care provision in the community. The impacts of this epidemic are too far reaching for policy decisions to be driven by epidemiology alone.""Professor Sheila Bird said that more cases in coming weeks would make it easier for the Government to predict how the epidemic is responding to lockdown measures, which will inform how long they remain in place. ""Once an epidemic takes hold, as now in UK, the country's own data - properly reported and interpreted - take precedence over modelling as the data tell us the actual toll which the epidemic is exacting,"" she said.""A huge amount can be inferred about the immediately forthcoming weeks from these data directly, including whether further policy changes are needed to reinforce social-distancing; for example in particular age groups.""Some experts are still concerned that the current restrictions do not go far enough while others say the government has been hit by an ""epidemic of action"", and is now bringing in measures that have little rationale. Professor Robert Dingwall, Professor of Sociology, at Nottingham Trent University, wrote in The Telegraph: ""It is another triumph of populism over science, of a capitulation to the demand to 'do something'. ""We are still seeing some notion that 'the people' are selfish and must be bullied and disciplined. ""The people are not selfish; they have behaved in ways that are individually rational but have collectively irrational results.""However Dr Andrea Collins, Senior Clinical Lecturer in Respiratory Medicine at the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine (LSTM), said: ""I believe that they have not quite gone far enough. The 'absolutely' necessary to go to work is still being used by some when it is not required-I think we need permits across controlled areas to go to a workplace.""Recent modelling from the universities of Exeter, Bristol and Warwick suggested that without any measures at all, the epidemic would have peaked around 133 days after first person-to-person transmission in Britain, which happened around February 28. So the lockdown has the potential of curtailing the spread by around seven weeks. A welcome relief for people who could have been facing lockdown for most of the summer.",Newspaper; Web Publication
441,"The way out of lockdown: the strategies evaluated;As other countries begin to ease restrictions, we look at the ways of doing so and analyse how each strategy could work for the UK","April 24, 2020 Friday",International,telegraph.co.uk,2867,2867,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,By Jessica Carpani and Amy Jones and Mike Wright,"The way out of lockdown: the strategies evaluatedAs other countries begin to ease restrictions, we look at the ways of doing so and analyse how each strategy could work for the UK","Countries across the world have been battling coronavirus from behind closed doors, with scientists advising governments on the best ways to ease their populations out of lockdown without setting off            a ""second wave"" of coronavirus but before risking economic collapse. Various strategies are being implemented by countries at different points on the trajectory of the virus, giving the UK the opportunity to learn from their policies. Following the extension of Britain's lockdown until May 7, there will be a review to decide whether restrictions remain in place or can be lifted. On Thursday, the Health Secretary, Matt Hancock, announced the beginning of Britain's strategy to            ""test, track and trace"", which he said could enable ""heavier"" social distancing measures to be eased.The Telegraph has spoken to experts in each field to ask how other countries are working their way out of lockdown and analyse how each strategy could work for the UK.                      Herd immunity and immunity passports                   On Monday, Government officials in Chile announced that they would issue the world's first ""immunity passports"", with comprehensive plans expected to be detailed next week. Physical or digital cards will be given to those who have tested positive for coronavirus but have recovered and are likely to have built up antibodies. Those eligible will be free to return to both work and wider society. Dr Rifat Atun, professor of Global Health Systems at Harvard University, has advised Chile on health policy for more than 25 years and said antibody tests can help governments assess the ""prevalence of the infections"", particularly in asymptomatic people. But he added that the tests still cannot tell us whether a person has developed immunity, how long they are immune for or the extent of the immunity - just that they have had the virus and recovered. The only way of knowing if such ""herd immunity"" has built up is by mass testing, while reducing restrictions in one area to see if people continue to get infected. ""You can check the infection levels to see if mixing leads to higher levels of infections,"" Dr Atun said. ""If you have a large number of people that are infected and we're not getting new infections, that suggests that there should be some kind of immunity because the virus is not being transmitted, so transmission between person to person is interrupted."" In Westminster, ""herd immunity"" has become a dirty term. The attempt to achieve it involved allowing ""enough of us who are going to get mild illness to become immune"", Sir Patrick Vallance, the chief scientific adviser, explained on March 13.But after data from Imperial College London showed how badly hospitals would be overwhelmed, the UK reversed course - and it seems there is no going back.•: When will UK lockdown end?Professor Neil Ferguson, of Imperial College, who sits on the Government's Sage advisory committee, said it was likely that only five percent of the UK population had been infected with the virus. ""There is almost no herd immunity and a very large risk of a second peak if we relax current measures without something to put in their place,"" he said.Even the most hawkish of backbenchers understands that ""herd immunity"" is over as a concept. One Conservative MP said: ""Even if privately many backbenchers wish we had pursued a policy similar to Sweden, it is understood that it is no longer possible.""There are also fears among some advisers that it could blur the rules of the lockdown and encourage others to take the restrictions less seriously.                     Social distancing                    Strict social distancing measures initially proved successful in China, which is at a more advanced stage of the pandemic. During the country's peak, in early February, there were between 2,000 and 4,000 new confirmed coronavirus cases per day. But leading up to March 23, it had            no new confirmed cases caused by local transmission for five consecutive days. One report, by the the MRC Centre for Global Infectious Disease Analysis and the Abdul Latif Jameel Institute for Disease and Emergency Analytics at Imperial College London, concluded that social distancing measures in China have led to control of Covid-19. Professor Christl Donnelly, Associate Director of the MRC Centre, said: ""At this difficult time, these results suggest that, after containment, a carefully managed and monitored relaxation of effective large-scale lockdowns may be possible even before an effective vaccine is available.""There is now debate at the top of the Government over how hard and fast the UK's lockdown measures should be eased. Cabinet hawks fear the devastation of the economy and are calling for an easing, while doves, including Boris Johnson and Mr Hancock, do not want to risk a second peak.One insider told The Telegraph: ""There's growing concern on the Tory backbenches about a lack of action, but the fear extends to the Cabinet too. Boris and Hancock have put the issue on the back burner. Ultimately a decision has to be taken, and it has to be done in a way that makes it look like the Government is in control rather than being chased by the opposition.""While there is an ongoing argument over how to ease measures, it is inevitable that some kind of social distancing will be with us for some time. One Whitehall source said: ""Until there is a vaccine or an effective drug, people will be asked to maintain a level of social distancing. Britons could have to get used to a very different way of life. Measures aren't going to be lifted overnight - they will be phased.""The chief medical officer, Professor Chris Whitty, this week told the country to brace itself for another year of ""disruptive"" measures. He said ministers would have to devise the ""optimal combination"" of social distancing to control the virus until a vaccine became available.This could mean workplaces are adapted to ensure colleagues keep a two-metre distance, but one source said: ""The real hope is that many people will continue to work from home - having that flexibility will be key.""One of the biggest challenges is thought to be maintaining social distancing on public transport, and a Whitehall source said: ""There is thought going into how to spread the rush hour, and businesses will be required to be more flexible when setting working patterns to try and keep people travelling at different times.""Grant Shapps, the Transport Secretary, has said businesses should be asking themselves why everybody has to travel in the rush hour.Sport and cultural activities could also look very different and there is also consideration as to whether theatres could open if every other seat is left empty, it is understood.Schools have long been thought of as one of the first institutions that could reopen as part of any easing. However, Geoff Barton, the general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders (ASCL), suggested June 1 is the earliest date on which they are likely to be able to do so.When schools are re-opened, a leading Government adviser has said they ""must do better"" at promoting good hygiene. Susan Michie, a professor of health psychology at University College London, said: ""School toilets can be pretty dismal places - that is an area that needs improvement.""                     Human contact tracing                   This strategy has been used in countries in the Far East including Singapore and, more successfully, Hong Kong. It involves trained contact tracing teams piecing together a Covid-19 patient's movements and potential contacts during the time that the person is infectious. Close contacts are then investigated and quarantined where necessary. Professor Li Yang, who heads the infectious diseases programme at the National University of Singapore's Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, said: ""When exiting lockdown, once people are able to move around more freely this becomes even more important as a way of quickly containing potential clusters of Covid-19.Prof Li warned that the method takes manpower and is ""time-intensive"", saying: ""Singapore's Ministry of Health had to rapidly expand its contact tracing team and tap on support from the police and military as the number of cases surged. Therefore, it is ideal to combine human contact tracing with other technological applications in order to reduce the manpower and time required."" In an updated paper seen by The Telegraph and initially published in the BMJ, experts estimate that, in order for the UK to replicate the Far East's success, it would need between 150,000 and 550,000 total volunteers. The co-authors of the paper, Dr Cam Bowie, retired director of public health, Somerset, and professor of community health, Malawi, and Dr Tony Hill, independent public health consultant and health strategist and retired director of public health, Lincolnshire, said: ""At the end of the day, control will only be achieved by case identification, isolation and contact tracing, and that can only be done at the local level.""It is not complicated - it can be re-commenced immediately without disruption to other efforts. It does not need demonstration sites. It is working in the Far East with Covid-19 right now."" The report says that, in order for contact tracing to be efficient, it needs to managed by local authorities, with an average of 2.8 full time local staff and trained volunteers to cope with each new case. Each new case will require 58 hours of time to trace 90 contacts and test 6.3 symptomatic contacts, a third of whom will have Covid-19. Between 800 and 3,000 volunteers will be needed two weeks after peak deaths in the averaged sized local authority, according to the report, which says training using local authority resources would take a single day. The system of contact tracing should, they said, be up and running in five working days, and local authorities would be able to relax physical distancing measures to get schools reopened two weeks after peak deaths. Mr Hancock announced on Thursday that he would be hiring 18,000 people to start testing and tracing for the virus in the community, including public health specialists and 3,000 clinicians. He gave no date for when the process would begin, but said the Government would be ""training up contact tracers over coming weeks"".However, Dr Bowie called the numbers ""paltry"" and said ""getting the volunteers is not a problem"", adding: ""The key point is that the numbers required and the methods used means this cannot be done centrally or regionally but only at local authority level. ""The number Public Health England think they need suggests they need to remember that we have not one homogenous epidemic but a myriad of small ones, dotting up in different places at different times, requiring different ways of curtailment. You simply cannot do that from London."" It is understood that council staff and civil servants are among those who will be drafted in. However, on Thursday the Local Government Authority (LGA) cast doubt on the plans by insisting that central Government should foot the bill as councils are already struggling with staff shortages because of coronavirus.Cllr Ian Hudspeth, the chairman of the LGA's community wellbeing board, said the extra demand on existing services ""would need to be met by additional resources and funding"".There has been some disquiet among Conservative backbenchers that the Government ever stopped contact tracing. A senior MP said: ""A lot of people thought abandoning contact tracing was a bad idea. While some regions were difficult to keep on top of, other areas have seen relatively low levels. Testing could have easily been focused in those areas.""The Prime Minister's official spokesman said: ""We'll make sure that we have whatever number of staff it is that we need.""While 18,000 people are being recruited ""initially"", the spokesman said that ""capacity will be quickly scaled up if that's needed"". He was unable to give a start date on when the contact tracing scheme will begin, but said work is ""progressing well"".                     Digital contact tracing                    Digital contact tracing is one of the few ways in which the authorities can keep pace with rapid real-time spread of coronavirus. The model the UK is looking to adopt sees people download an app that logs other mobile phones that come into close contact with it via Bluetooth connections. When a user comes down with coronavirus, an alert can be sent to all the people they had contact with, telling them to self-isolate. This system could get people self-isolating before they even show symptoms - a period when they are still infectious and most likely to unwittingly spread the virus.Digital contract tracing needs a large proportion of a population to take part for it to be effective. Even then, it is still just one element of a successful virus containment strategy and needs to be deployed alongside mass testing to be successful. Without millions of people using the app properly, alongside a mass testing regime, digital contract tracing is unlikely to halt the virus.South Korea and Singapore have both used data from the mobile phones of people diagnosed with Covid-19 to trace the people with whom they have come into contact.The authorities in South Korea have successfully used GPS data to help human contact tracing teams, and on Wednesday reported only eight new confirmed coronavirus cases. Singapore has used apps that track other phones that come into close range via Bluetooth connections. The shortcomings of the system can be seen in Singapore which, despite early successes in containing the virus, now has a rising rate of infection, with total cases topping 8,000 this week. This has partly been attributed to the spread in crowded government-built dormitories for migrant workers, where social distancing is difficult to maintain. Professor Li warned that digital tracing is not effective without mass take-up and if social distancing is not adhered to. He said: ""Generally, the majority of the population will need to have installed such apps before they become truly useful.""A study by Oxford University last week found that if 56 percent of the population were to use a contact tracing app, it would effectively stop the spread of the virus before a vaccine or cure is found. To achieve this in practice, the NHS will have to get its app working efficiently and downloaded by around 30 million people by the time the lockdown eases.                     Vaccine treatment                   A coronavirus vaccine has been long-hailed as the weapon that will defeat Covid-19 and unlock society, and this week the UK joined the US - which currently has two studies - and China, in beginning human trials for a vaccine. Yet Mr Johnson and his Cabinet are only too aware that a preventative jab is unlikely to be forthcoming in this calendar year and, acting on evidence provided by its scientific advisers, the Government now appears to have set sail for a lengthy lockdown.""There is a real fear at the top about a second peak,"" one Whitehall insider said. ""Sage are warning that there will need to be fairly strict lockdown measures until a vaccine is found. Unfortunately, this may take some time.""Mr Hancock this week confirmed that two leading vaccine developments - Oxford University and Imperial College London - would receive a total of £42.5 million to support their clinical trials, saying that the UK ""is at the forefront of the global effort"".Professor Robin Shattock, the head of mucosal infection and immunity at Imperial College London, who is leading its team in developing a vaccine, said: ""The timelines for rolling out a vaccine for the whole of the UK are too long to stay on total lockdown, but early availability of vaccines that have demonstrable efficacy and safety pre-gaining a marketing license could be used to protect key groups - health care workers, care home staff, providing part of the strategy to relaxing the lockdown."" He agreed that, considering the time it would take to develop a vaccine and make it widely available, ""any nationwide campaign is unlikely to take place before the end of the year"". Dr Sheuli Porkess, the director of research, medical and innovation at the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry, said: ""Vaccination has saved more lives and prevented more serious diseases than any advance in recent medical history. ""Any vaccine for Covid-19 must be thoroughly tested to make sure it's safe and effective, and that is what companies and organisations around the world are working on now.""Professor Adam Finn, professor of paediatrics at the University of Bristol, said: ""Epidemics are controlled by generating sufficient population immunity that transmission drops away. Vaccines are the only tool we have to do this aside from just letting everyone get the disease or stopping normal life."" Earlier this week, ministers refused to confirm whether UK taxpayers would be first in the queue to receive a successful vaccine. However, it is understood that, if the Oxford or Imperial trials prove successful, Britons will have priority.",Newspaper; Web Publication

An expert in the modelling and analysis of disease spread, he and his team designed a trial to establish the value of the new Ebola vaccine. As a result he was awarded an OBE in 2016 for his services to infectious disease control.                     Professor Neil Ferguson                   Vice dean, faculty of medicine, Imperial College, London, and co-founder of the MRC Centre for Global Infectious Disease Analysis.One of the longest serving SAGE attendees, Neil Ferguson first came to prominence through his work combating the foot and mouth outbreak in 2001. His modelling of the spread of the disease saw him awarded an OBE but also proved controversial, with other academics claiming it resulted in the unnecessary deaths of millions of animals. He also played a prominent role in producing mathematical models for the swine flu pandemic in 2009 and the Ebola outbreak in 2014.                     Professor Jonathan Van-Tam, deputy chief medical officerAn expert in influenza, he has a long history as both an academic and also working for the pharmaceutical industry having held senior positions with Roche, SmithKline Beecham (now GSK) and Aventis Pasteur MSD. Took up the position of the government's deputy chief medical officer in 2017 and also sits on the New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group which is a sub-committee to SAGE.

Some are known to have attended a number of Sage meetings dealing with the Covid-19 crisis, others attended less often, perhaps only a single meeting.Mr Cummings is understood to have attended several meetings, including the one on March 23, the day Boris Johnson announced the lockdown following scientific advice on the need for stringent measures to limit deaths.The Government has so far refused to name any of those on Sage but pressure on it to do so increased yesterday. Adding his own voice to the call for openness, Prof Chris Whitty, the Chief Medical Officer, said his colleague Sir Patrick Vallance, the Chief Scientific Adviser, felt the same. ""Neither of us have any problem in principle with the names being made public,"" he said.However, Sir Patrick has separately told MPs that disclosing the list of Sage members could leave them vulnerable to outside lobbying interests. A number of those on the committee and its sub-committees already have links to pharmaceutical firms that could be perceived as conflicts of interests.Those on the Sage committee include Prof John Edmunds, an epidemiologist at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM) who sits on Sage as well as two of its subcommittees. His partner, Jeanne Pimenta, works for the pharmaceutical giant GLAXOSMITHKLINE (GSK) and also holds shares in the company. Prof Edmunds said that his partner had recently resigned from GSK and was working out her notice.Others on Sage include Prof Graham Medley, also at LSHTM, Peter Horby, Professor of Emerging Infectious Diseases and Global Health at Oxford University, Neil Ferguson, mathematical Continued on Page 4 Continued from Page 1 modeller at Imperial College, Dr Jim McMenamin of Health Protection Scotland, Sharon Peacock, director of the National Infection Service at Public Health England, and Ian Diamond, head of the Government Statistical Service.Sir Patrick claimed in a letter to MPs that the Government does not disclose membership of Sage partly to protect ""them from lobbying and other forms of unwanted influence which may hinder their ability to give impartial advice"".Chi Onwurah, the shadow science minister, said: ""There will already be lobbying going on and the response to lobbying is greater transparency, not less.""Lord O'Donnell, the long-serving former cabinet secretary, told the BBC Today programme: ""We always used to publish membership of ministerial committees. I don't see any reason why we can't list the people [on Sage].""Sir David King, the former chief scientific adviser, added: ""I do not see or understand the secrecy around who the science adviser is getting advice from. I think it would be so important to gain the trust of the public by acting openly. It's very simple, but at the moment we are not privy to the discussions.""Prof Whitty told MPs on the science and technology select committee yesterday that he and Sir Patrick had no objection themselves to the names being released ""in principle"" but that the Centre for the Protection of National Infrastructure had said the names should not be disclosed.He said this was because some non Covid-19 meetings of Sage may occasionally involve matters of national security so ""the principle needed to be thought through quite carefully."" But the calls for transparency were echoed by several senior figures on Sage and its sub-committees - the very people the Government claims it wants to ""protect"". They said it was ""counterproductive"" to keep their identities private, and that the Government should publish their names in order to shoreup public trust.Prof Susan Michie, who has attended one Sage meeting and sits on the Scientific Pandemic Influenza Group on Behavioural Science, or ""SPI-B"" - one of four highly influential committees that feeds into Sage, told The Telegraph that she has spoken out on the issue.""Given openness and transparency are important for trust, and trust is important for adherence to Government advice, it makes sense to me to publish names and papers agreed by the committees in a timely manner,"" she said.A few Sage members told The Telegraph that they had faced threats from the public and a couple said that as a result they preferred not to be named.However, others - such as Prof Robert Dingwall, who sits on the New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group (NERVTAG) - said they supported transparency regardless. ""I think, as a matter of principle, that membership of such advisory groups should be in the public domain.""The Government has repeatedly refused to disclose the membership of SPI-B or name the five members of the Covid-19 Clinical Information Network, another of the four sub-committees referred to as CO-CIN, which is kept so secret it is not even referred to on Sage's website. It does, however, publish the full membership of NERVTAG, along with register of interests.Prof Edmunds is one of those who fully disclosed his interests, including his partner's employment and shares, in the register when it was last updated in November 2018. It used to publish the membership of the Scientific Pandemic Influenza Group on Modelling (SPI-M) but deleted the page three weeks ago.The lack of complete transparency has echoes of the way the World Health Organisation (WHO) operated during the 2009 swine flu crisis, when it refused to disclose the names of the scientists it relied on for advice.At the time, critics raised fears that there may have been conflicts of interests that would have enabled pharmaceutical companies to influence decisions to buy up vast amounts of vaccine against the illness.However, WHO claimed that it had to keep the membership secret in order to protect them from undue pressure, and insisted that it had vetted them.A Government spokesman said: ""During this crisis, the Government has rightly consulted expert advisers with a wealth of academic, scientific, medical and private sector experience to tackle Covid-19 and save lives.""It is wrong and unfair to those advisers to suggest that scientific knowledge and experience is being shared for any other reason than to aid the national effort to beat this virus.""The decision to not disclose Sage membership is based upon advice from the Centre for the Protection of National Infrastructure and is in line with the standard procedure for COBR [Cobra] meetings, to which Sage gives advice. This is to safeguard individual members' personal security and protect them from lobbying and other forms of unwanted influence which may hinder their ability to give impartial advice.""",Newspaper
444,"The happiness professor's guide to looking after your wellbeing in lockdown;Paul Dolan says we can redesign our lives for maximum happiness, even in the most challenging of circumstances","April 25, 2020 Saturday",International,telegraph.co.uk,3284,3284,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,By Boudicca Fox-Leonard,"The happiness professor's guide to looking after your wellbeing in lockdownPaul Dolan says we can redesign our lives for maximum happiness, even in the most challenging of circumstances","Paul Dolan is as ebullient over the phone as he is in real life. Lockdown, on the surface, has not dulled the spirits of the man nicknamed the ""           Professor of Happiness"".A government adviser on wellbeing and author of two books, Happiness by Design and Happy Ever After, Dolan, a professor of behavioural science at the London School of Economics, has long argued that we can redesign our lives for maximum happiness. That's why I've phoned him, to glean any insights he might have as we enter week seven (or is that week six? or week eight?) of lockdown. The honeymoon period, if there ever was one, is waning and, with ­sourdough starters languishing in ­cupboards across the nation, and the novelty of Zoom chats having well and truly worn off, I wondered whether he might have some words to gee us all up. What I'd forgotten is that Dolan isn't a ""happiness guru"". He's an evidence-based, serious academic who during his time as a visiting scholar at Princeton worked closely with the Nobel ­laureate psychologist and economist Daniel Kahneman (he wrote the foreword to Dolan's first book). And so he tells me: ""There's this idea that you can just bounce around and find things that are going to make you happy, but it's OK to have acceptance of the situation, the sense that it's OK to feel a bit s---.""Not quite what I expected, but it's bluntly what we all need right now. As the stabs at self-improvement slough away to reveal a deep craving for ­certainty, and as many of us struggle financially and emotionally, we can't help but agonise over what the new normal might look like once this is all over. You might even be the one in need. The happiness we gain by helping ­others has been well established, the so-called selfishness of selflessness, but maybe right now, you might be the one in receipt of a little altruism. In other words, it's OK to have an unhappy lockdown. ""You can be honest that life's not as good as it was,"" says Dolan.In Happiness By Design, published in 2014, Dolan encouraged us to listen more to our real feelings of happiness than to our reflections on how happy we think we are or ought to be. It makes sense that we might be struggling to put a brave face on things right now. His own happiness levels, something he's not usually that keen to talk about (""It's the hardest question to answer""), aren't currently zinging out of the park.And he's one of the lucky ones. He's got a lovely garden at his home in Brighton, and enough rooms in the house for himself, his wife, 12-year-old daughter and son, 10, to each enjoy their own space. But what is happiness? In Happiness by Design, he said it was the flow of ­experiences of pleasure and purpose over time. No one-size-fits-all method, but a framework around which all our personal differences can fit. With pubs, galleries and national parks shut right now, our various pleasures have been severely restricted. Meanwhile, purpose, particularly for those furloughed, has been stripped away. As we try to rebuild what gives us pleasure and ­purpose from home, some of us will cope better than others. ""Introverts are finally having their moment in the sun,"" says Dolan, then laughs, ""or not, because they're not ­allowed to sunbathe.""Meanwhile as an ""extreme extrovert"" he's realised that he's geared up for the outside world, which is no longer available on tap. ""It's one of the reasons I'm struggling."" He talks wistfully about when things might get back to normal. For him, there will be a decent haircut (curr­ently home-dyed pink and self-chopped), resumption of his gym sessions five times a week, and take­away coffees where he enjoys bantering with the barista. Even the things that have always given him pleasure aren't quite the same in lockdown. He's been lifting weights in his garden but has realised that it's not purely about the weights. ""It's about going to the gym and doing it. It's my mindfulness. Doing an activity with flow.""                     : How to look after your mental health in lockdownMy journalist colleagues and I have been responsible for a plethora of ­articles extolling the virtues of new lockdown hobbies and how this might be your chance for self-transformation, but he's unconvinced we can use this caesura to tick off those long-harboured ambitious projects.""First of all, we're lazy. We don't really change much about ourselves very often and if we are going to, we need to have a plan, we need to create habits, we need to invest effort into it,"" he says.If you do want to make the most of your time in lockdown, it's about what academics call the implementation of intentions. ""You don't suddenly start writing a book,"" says Dolan. ""There's a series of steps that you take in order for you to pick the pen up in the proverbial sense. It's about designing it into your life. You're not going to do it by simply ­saying you've got the intention to.""And before that implementation, ask yourself if it's something you actually want to do, or whether it's something you think you ought to do because it's what is expected of you if, say, you're a journalist like myself. ""When you don't write the book, is it because you've been lazy and haven't planned to do it properly? Or is that you actually deep down don't want to do it?""Suddenly, I feel very seen. And happier for being let off the hook. Yet lockdown does provide an avenue for change in a really positive way. It's an opportunity to break out of our habit system, comparable to moving house or starting a new job. Now is an opportunity to establish new, positive habits that, if we do them with enough regularity, might just stick with us post-lockdown.Trying new things, a challenge in the current climate, is proven to be good for us. Even when we don't want to try new things because we think we won't like them. Dolan has joined a few ­informal socials online with colleagues, despite dreading it, and: ""I have to say, I have quite enjoyed them, much more than I anticipated I would.""As a society, lockdown is challenging our preconceived notions about what makes us happy. In his second book, Happy Ever After, published last year, Dolan addressed the social narrative traps that people fall into: that finding everlasting love, or being rich and successful, will make us happy. He urged us not to sweat the big stuff, that freeing ourselves from the myth of the perfect life might make us happier.To that end, the Thursday Clap has fascinated him. While he doesn't expect the world to change and start paying nurses and shop assistants huge amounts of money, it's highlighted how those people who occupy generally low status and low-paid positions are who we truly rely upon right now. ""A lot of the jobs that we have ­aspirations for, we just don't need,"" he says. ""They're just not valuable at a time of crisis.""Might we see people re-evaluating the value of those big-salaried jobs? One of the major lessons of Happy Ever After is that we need to learn to say ""just enough"" rather than ""more please"". Lockdown has shown us that, but will we remember to consume less once it's over?Dolan is unconvinced: ""It's like every time you're sick you say you'll ­remember how this felt, and as soon as you're well again you forget.""Still, he is careful to preface any ­discussion of happiness and income by saying that poverty makes people ­miserable. ""It's attention-seeking. If you pay attention to something that makes you feel good, you'll be happy. If you pay attention to something that makes you feel bad, it's going to make you miserable. If your attention is being drawn to how you're going to pay the bills, the rent, feed the kids, then that will make you miserable,"" he says, adding: ""It's incumbent on us as a society to take care of the worst-off.""And if you are someone who is privileged enough to be waiting out the crisis with few financial worries, a stable and safe home life, then appreciating your privilege is important. He worries about the children sent home from school trapped in dysfunctional home lives, the women and men in abusive relationships, and those in poorer countries where the health systems are unable to cope with the crisis. ""Rather than looking upwards all the time, remind yourself that most of us haven't got it that bad, even now."" Invoking the need to practise gratitude makes him sound awfully like a self-help guru...""I often shy away from saying that, as it might sound glib coming from my privileged position, but there's good robust, academic evidence on that,"" laughs Dolan. ""Good studies have shown gratitude to be significant in ­improving happiness.""                     Work                    For those of us privileged enough to still have jobs that we can do at home, the challenge is finding the distinction between work time and leisure time, which was much more obvious when we had more set hours. Arrange to have a drink online with a friend at the end of the day. Make a commitment that you stick to.  Perceived control and autonomy makes us feel happy. If you feel like you're master of your destiny you are happier than if you feel like you're facing a life full of constraints. Lockdown has imposed constraints on everybody, so what we need to do in order to be happy as individuals is to try to find a little bubble of volition within that. So far as it is possible, choose different work hours to suit you. You might be someone who likes to work late or get up early. Change your office day to those hours and it makes you feel like you're a bit more in control.  It's almost certain that most people will be working from home more after this. Universities have spent 20 years saying why it is not possible to teach online, but we all learnt to do it in a week. I've given lectures on Zoom, and the good thing for me now is that I can see the students' names come up on the screen. I'm engaging with them more on a first-name basis than when I was face to face with them.                      Exercise                    Now is an opportunity for people who wanted to do a little bit more exercise to get up in the morning and have a go. If the lockdown continues, then there has been enough time for something to become a bit more automatic. It takes time to embed some of those behaviours we start under lockdown into habits.  Right now speaks to people who always say they don't have time to do things. It's not that you don't have time, it's that you don't make time. People often ask me how I go to the gym five times a week, and I did that for 20 years until these last couple of weeks. It's because it's in my diary. It's planned, it's organised because it matters to me and it's important. There are things that you can do to take back control in this current situation so you have little pockets of autonomy, even if the rest of it feels constrained.                     Family                    When we go on holiday, the things we remember are never how long you were away for. It was that moment when you saw a site that you all loved, or a sunset. It is a moment. That's what we encode in our memories. You can't engineer these things; if you try to create memories they become inauthentic, but insofar as we can remind ourselves, it's useful to know it is the small unexpected moments that will form our future memories.  We don't watch much television together, but one thing we have started doing as a family together is watch Modern Family from the beginning. It's just-about age appropriate and it's nice to have that as a shared experience. They're 20-minutes episodes, so you can duck in, do one and disappear again. I like watching Modern Family with the kids, but I don't want to be with them all the time. Any honest parent knows that time, especially with young kids, is really hard. There are moments of joy and long periods of misery. That acceptance of being able to say that; maybe that's something we can be a bit more honest about now.                      Food                    In previous recessions mental health problems increased, but physical health improved. That was until the last recession, when people started buying more takeaways and cheap processed foods that are quicker to consume. In previous recessions the reason was that people had more time and they prepared healthier meals that take longer. That's something those that enjoy cooking, and even those who don't, can do right now. Plan a meal, cook it together and listen to music while you do it.                      Relationships                    In Wuhan, people were rushing to separate the moment lockdown was lifted. The divorce rate in this country is bound to increase significantly after lockdown.Normally I say to people, ""If in doubt, get out"", but context matters so much that you might not want to do that the moment lockdown ends. There might not be anything fundamentally wrong with the relationship. You might want to wait a few more weeks to see if you can actually tolerate this person when you don't have to spend every minute with them.  We're not very good at understanding the impact of context generally. We imagine ourselves and other people as these consistent and coherent creatures. We consider a relationship as either strong or weak, regardless of the environment we find ourselves in. I think all good, functioning relationships work well when you're not together. No one's supposed to spend six weeks with the same person all the time.I never need to be on my own, whereas my wife craves time on her own, so both of us are alert to that difference, and we manage it in a way that suits us both to some extent.  If you have unrealistic expectations of a blissful relationship, you're going to be sadly let down. Your loved one might start to get on your nerves, and that's OK. Maybe you can tell them that and they can tell you. We don't want to be honest, because it's harmful to people, but a little less skating around the subject might be helpful right now.                      Paul's tips for staying happy                                                               1. Accept that things are messed up                                        It's good to think positively, but be realistic. Many people are afraid of Covid-19 and the policy responses affect us all. Happiness levels will fall and the disruption to normal life is difficult to deal with. If we accept this, though, a lot of the pressure to be happy will be lifted and, counter-intuitively perhaps, we will be happier as a result. Insofar as you want to change anything, it will also make effective behaviour change more likely. The various types of therapy out there share a common initial emphasis on accepting who we are, and from this behaviour change becomes possible.                                             2. Have realistic expectations about what you will change                                        I have heard lots of people say that they are going to use the time at home in ways they have never used before, such as reading more books. Many of these same people have been saying something similar every new year or summer holiday for years. But past behaviours predict future actions much more accurately than do intentions, and so most of us won't do in the next few weeks things we have not got around to in the past 20 years. So, set yourself realistic expectations about what you will change, by how much and when.                                             3. Find a balance between pleasure and purpose                                        Happiness is best conceptualised as the flow of pleasure and purpose over time. We need a balance between activities we find relatively fun on the one hand and relatively fulfilling on the other. My balance may be different to yours (you might be happier with more purpose than fun) and what we find pleasurable and purposeful might also differ (I love the gym, you might hate it). So, think about what makes you happy and in what ways. Right now, you might want to focus more on purpose, since many sources of pleasure have been removed. However, the small pleasures are now more precious.                                             4. Design your environment to make it easier to do what you want to                                        Willpower can only get you so far (and intentions hardly anywhere at all). The heavy lifting of behaviour change is done by design power. In other words, we are more likely to change what we do in response to the cues and triggers around us than by simply urging ourselves to change. If you want to read a certain book, make a commitment to your friends that you will do so by the time that the lockdown is over. If you want to go for a run in the morning, create a norm by enlisting your spouse or housemate.                                            5. Help others                                         One of the most beneficial activities you can engage in is to help someone else. Once you have established that your donation of time or money is in their best interests, not only do they benefit, but you do too. Even if we don't do it for external recognition, helping others makes us feel better about ourselves. Social distancing has made helping others a little more challenging, but it is still possible to volunteer or to donate to charities. Alternatively, reach out to someone in your friendship group who might feel lonely or vulnerable. The need for support has rarely been so acute.                                            6. Create new habits                                         Your brain is lazy and creates habit loops to save you from thinking too hard. Those habit loops (for example, checking emails on your commute) get broken when the environment changes. A lockdown is a great opportunity to reboot what you do. If you've always wanted to exercise when you wake up, now you can. It might just stick when lockdown ends.                                            7. Plan your days                                         The idea of no routine is enticing, but it's a recipe for either doing nothing or doing too much of one thing, such as working long hours. Without a plan, we take the path of least resistance. To get some work and/or exercise done and find an optimal work-life balance, do key activities (e.g. showering, getting ready for work and exercising) at the same time each day.                                             8. Go outdoors                                         While there is no one-size-fits-all approach to happiness, there are some activities that are good for all of us. Going outdoors is one of these. Thankfully, the lockdown recognises this and does not preclude us from venturing outside. Take the opportunity for some fresh air (and the air will be fresher wherever you live due to the reduction in pollution).                                            9. Listen to music with other people                                         Listening to music is the only activity that stimulates the whole brain and we are all happier when we are with people whose company we enjoy. So, the lockdown is the ideal time to get a few friends with similar music tastes together online and listen to some tunes that you all like.                                            10. Ask for help                                        Many people's lives are being adversely affected by the lockdown. Accepting that might only get you so far. You might also need some help from other people and support networks. Look to get that support if you require it. There is no shame in doing so. And remember, you are making someone else happy by asking for their help.",Newspaper; Web Publication

If your attention is being drawn to how you're going to pay the bills, the rent, feed the kids, then that will make you miserable,"" he says, adding: ""It's incumbent on us as a society to take care of the worst-off.""And if you are someone who is privileged enough to be waiting out the crisis with few financial worries, a stable and safe home life, then appreciating your privilege is important.He worries about the children sent home from school trapped in dysfunctional home lives, the women and men in abusive relationships, and those in poorer countries where the health systems are unable to cope with the crisis. ""Rather than looking upwards all the time, remind yourself that most of us haven't got it that bad, even now.""Invoking the need to practise gratitude makes him sound awfully like a self-help guru… ""I often shy away from saying that, as it might sound glib coming from my privileged position, but there's good robust, academic evidence on that,"" laughs Dolan. ""Good studies have shown gratitude to be significant in improving happiness.""Boudicca Fox-Leonard For those of us privileged enough to still have jobs that we can do at home, the challenge is finding the distinction between work time and leisure time, which was much more obvious when we had more set hours. Arrange to have a drink online with a friend at the end of the day. Make a commitment that you stick to.Perceived control and autonomy makes us feel happy. If you feel like destiny you are happier than if you feel like you're facing a life full of constraints. Lockdown has imposed constraints on everybody, so what we need to do in order to be happy as individuals is to try to find a little bubble of volition within that. So far as it is possible, choose different work hours to suit you. You might be someone who likes to work late or get up early. Change your office day to those hours and it makes you feel like you're a bit more in control.It's almost certain most people will be working from home more after this.Universities have spent 20 years saying why it not possible to teach online, but we all learnt to do it in a week.I've given lectures on Zoom, and the good thing for me now is can see the students' names come up on the screen. I'm engaging with them more on a first-name basis than when I was face to face Now is an opportunity for people who wanted do a little bit more exercise to get up in the morning and have a go.the lockdown continues for six weeks, then that is enough time for something to become a bit more automatic. It takes time embed some of those behaviours we start under lockdown into habits.Right now speaks to people who always say they don't have time to do things. It's not that you don't have time, it's that you don't make time. People often ask me how I go to the gym five times a week, and I did that for 20 years until these last couple of weeks. It's because it's in my diary. It's planned, it's organised because it matters to me and it's important. There are things that you can do to take back control in this current situation so you have little pockets of autonomy, even if the rest of it feels constrained.FAMILY When we go on holiday, the things we remember are never how long you were away for. It was that moment when you saw a site that you all loved, or a sunset. It is a moment. That's what we encode in our memories. You can't engineer these things; if you try to create memories they become inauthentic, but insofar as we can remind ourselves, it's useful to know it is the small unexpected moments that will form our future memories.We don't watch much television together, but one thing we have started doing as a family together is watch Modern Family from the beginning. It's justabout age appropriate and it's nice to have that as a shared experience. They're 20-minutes episodes, so you can duck in, do one and disappear again.I like watching Modern Family with the kids, but I don't want to be with them all the time. Any honest parent knows that time, especially with young kids, is really hard. There are moments of joy and long periods of misery. That acceptance of being able to say that; maybe that's something we can be a bit more honest about now.FOOD In previous recessions mental health problems increased, but physical health improved. That was until the last recession, when people started buying more takeaways and cheap processed foods that are quicker to consume. In previous recessions the reason was that people had more time and they prepared healthier meals that take longer. That's something those that enjoy cooking, and even those who don't, can do right now. Plan a meal, cook it together and listen to music while you do it.RELATIONSHIPS In Wuhan, people were rushing to separate the moment lockdown was lifted. The divorce rate in this country is bound to increase significantly after lockdown. Normally I say to people, If in doubt, get out"", but context matters so much that you might not want do that the moment lockdown ends. There might not be anything fundamentally wrong with the relationship. You might want to wait a few more weeks to see if you can actually tolerate this person when you don't have to spend every minute with them.to We're not very good at understanding the impact of context generally. We imagine ourselves and other people as these consistent and coherent creatures. We consider a relationship as either strong or weak, regardless of the environment we find ourselves in. I think all good, functioning relationships work well when you're not www.together.No one's supposed to spend six weeks with the same person all the time. I never need to be on my own, whereas my wife craves time on her own, so both of us are alert to that difference, and we manage it in a way that suits us both to some extent.If you have unrealistic expectations of a blissful relationship, you're going to be sadly let down. Your loved one might start to on your nerves, and that's OK. Maybe you can tell them that and they can you. We don't want to be honest, because it's harmful to people, but a little less skating around the subject might be helpful right PAUL'S TEN TIPS FOR STAYING HAPPY 1 Accept that things are messed up It's good to think positively, but be realistic. Many people are afraid of Covid-19 and the policy responses affect us all. Happiness levels will fall and the disruption to normal life is difficult to deal with. If we accept this, though, a lot of the pressure to be happy will be lifted and, counter-intuitively perhaps, we will be happier as a result. Insofar as you want to change anything, it will also make effective behaviour change more likely. The various types of therapy out there share a common initial emphasis on accepting who we are, and from this behaviour 2 Have realistic expectations about what you will change I have heard lots of people say that they are going to use the time at home in ways they have never used before, such as reading more books. Many of these same people have been saying something similar every new year or summer holiday for years. But past behaviours predict future actions much more accurately than do intentions, and so most of us won't do in the next few weeks things we have not got around to in the past 20 years. So, set yourself realistic expectations about what you will change, by 3 Find a balance between pleasure and purpose Happiness is best conceptualised as the flow of pleasure and purpose over time. We need a balance between activities we find relatively fun on the one hand and relatively fulfilling on the other. My balance may be different to yours (you might be happier with more purpose than fun) and what we find pleasurable and purposeful might also differ (I love the gym, you might hate it). So, think about what makes you happy and in what ways. Right now, you might want to focus more on purpose, since many sources of pleasure have been removed. However, the small pleasures are now more precious.4 Design your environment to make it easier to do what you want to Willpower can only get you so far (and intentions hardly anywhere at all). The heavy lifting of behaviour change is done by design power. In other words, we are more likely to change what we do in response to the cues and triggers around us than by simply urging ourselves to change. If you want to read a certain book, make a commitment to your friends that you will do so by the time that the lockdown is over. If you want to go for a run in the morning, create a norm by enlisting your spouse or housemate.5 Help others One of the most beneficial activities you can engage in is to help someone else. Once you have established that your donation of time or money is in their best interests, not only do they benefit, but you do too. Even if we don't do it for external recognition, helping others makes us feel better about ourselves. Social distancing has made helping others a little more challenging, but it is still possible to volunteer or to donate to charities. Alternatively, reach out to someone in your friendship group who might feel lonely or vulnerable. The need for support has rarely been so acute.6 Create new habits Your brain is lazy and creates habit loops to save you from thinking too hard. Those habit loops (for example, checking emails on your commute) get broken when the environment changes. A lockdown a great opportunity to reboot what you do. If you've always wanted to exercise when you wake now you can. It might just stick when lockdown ends.7 Plan your days The idea of no routine is enticing, but it's a recipe for either doing nothing or doing too much of one thing, such as working long hours. Without a plan, we take the path of least resistance. To get some work and/or exercise done and find an optimal work-life balance, do key activities (e.g. showering, getting ready for work and exercising) at the same time each day.8 Go outdoors While there is no one-size-fits-all approach to happiness, there are some activities that are good for all of us. Going outdoors is one of these. Thankfully, the lockdown recognises this and does not preclude us from venturing outside. Take the opportunity for some fresh air (and the air will be fresher wherever you live due to the reduction in pollution).9 Listen to music with other people Listening to music is the only activity that stimulates the whole brain and we are all happier when we are with people whose company we enjoy. So, the lockdown is the ideal time to get a few friends with similar music tastes together online and listen to some tunes that you all like.10 Ask for help Many people's lives are being adversely affected by the lockdown. Accepting that might only get you so far. You might also need some help from other people and support networks. Look to get that support if you require it. There is no shame in doing so. And remember, you are making someone else happy by asking for their help.'Rather than looking upwards, remind yourself most of us haven't got it that bad, even now'as it is possible, choose different work hours to suit youspeaks to people who always say they don't have time to do things'Arrange to have a drink online with a friend at the end of the day.",Newspaper

""We must realise that some people are responding to what they are being asked to do, they are not flouting the rules.""It is very, very difficult when we are getting mixed messages from the government - on the one hand stay at home, on the other hand go into non-essential work.""Ms Michie said people had ""a powerful influence"" on each other, telling Sky News: ""It may be that people then think, 'well they are out and about, I think I will go out and about too'. We have a real problem there.""The comments are significant because the professor is a member of the Covid-19 behavioural science advisory group as well as Sage, the scientific advisory group for emergencies.They come as a debate rages in the government and the Conservative Party about when and how to relax restrictions, ahead of Boris Johnson's expected to return to work on Monday.Traffic levels on the roads have begun creeping up this week and there have been scenes of sizeable crowds in shopping centres and parks in recent days.Motor vehicle use was recorded at 38 per cent of pre-lockdown levels during the first three days of last week - but rose to 41 per cent from Monday to Wednesday this week.But the criticism was rejected by Ms Patel, at the daily Downing Street press conference, who said: ""The government message has been clear and consistent from day one about staying at home.""We have also been clear that, if you can't work from home, you can go to work. There are no mixed messages. We have been clear, the police have been clear.""The clash came as the home secretary played down hopes of an early easing of the lockdown as the death toll in hospitals passed 20,000.She called it a ""deeply tragic and moving moment"", warning ""we are not out of the woods yet"" - and telling people to stick to social distancing instructions.""The government has been abundantly clear about the five specific things that have to be satisfied - this is not optional - so that we can consider with the scientific advisers when it will be safe to adjust the current measures.""Quite frankly that is not right now. It is clear that it is not right now.""",Newspaper; Web Publication
447,Balanced budgets are so old hat,"April 25, 2020 Saturday",International,thetimes.co.uk,939,939,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,Irwin Stelzer,Balanced budgets are so old hat,"Out with the new, in with the old is the political rule as two septuagenarians - old white guys in blue suits, as voters unhappy with the choice put it - face off for the presidency of the United States. Out with the old, in with the new is the economic policy rule.Start with fiscal policy. When Joseph reigned supreme in Egypt and John Maynard Keynes reigned supreme in policy circles, the strategy was to run deficits in lean years. What seemed sensible then, at least to economists who believed a lack of demand was the cause of recessions and depressions, is now thought excessively growth-restricting, at least to adherents of modern monetary theory, or MMT. After all, what are a central bank's printing presses for?Down with fusty old Milton Friedman, up with Stephanie Kelton, the Stony Brook University economist and adviser to Bernie Sanders who, if not the sole creator of MMT, is certainly its most evangelical enthusiast.Budget balancers are not only obsolete, but dangerous. Limiting fiscal policy to black ink in fear of inflation stifles growth. Recent experience with buckets of red ink proves that deficits do not produce inflation. Better to run large deficits, reaping the benefits of rapid growth, until inflation rears its unlovely head, and then raise taxes to nip that inflation in the proverbial bud.Worry not that this year's budget deficit is set to clock in at about $4 trillion, perhaps 20% of GDP, and the accumulated federal debt to top 100% of GDP. Economic policy is now driven by MMT, which is called ""ludicrous ... fallacious at multiple levels ... [and from] fringe economists"" by Larry Summers, former Treasury secretary to a liberal president and the intellectual darling of the centre-left.With the supply side of the economy likely to remain in intensive care for quite a while, the central bank's ability to produce paper money will exceed the economy's ability to produce stuff people want to buy with those dollars.With too much money chasing too few goods - Friedman's formulation - prices will start to rise and the politicians will be challenged to gird their loins and do as the MMTers assume they will: raise taxes. We will then know whether the theory will survive that clash with reality. Or whether, instead, politicians prefer inflation to tax rises, in which case interest rates will soar as lenders demand to be compensated for the risk of being repaid in depreciated dollars. Those interest payments will consume so large a portion of the government's budget as to be unsustainable.Along with MMT, the new policy alphabet soup includes UBI, or universal basic income. Traditionalist economists and policymakers believe the incentive to earn and spend drives people from the couch into the workplace, or into the lab in search of life-changing innovations. This is supplemented by what Adam Smith taught and, lately, behavioural economists teach: man is more than homo economicus. The regard of others, empathy with the poor, and religious belief all affect behaviour.But replacing the need to toil with a government that is somewhere between Lady Bountiful and the Tooth Fairy will reduce the incentives that make people work and capitalists' animal spirits soar. Capitalism will have to develop new incentives.UBI advocates dismiss any worries that it would be a disincentive to productive effort. Covid-19 has revealed that many Americans live on the edge of penury, among them workers we now realise are ""essential"" to the provision and delivery of the stuff on which we depend. Rather than fiddling with the programmes that in combination we call ""the welfare state"", give Americans money, conjured from thin air by the central bank rather than paid for with taxes (see MMT, above).Prisoners of old theories, among them a few Republican legislators, worry that when such payments exceed the wages offered by, say, Amazon and Walmart, seeking 175,000 and 150,000 new staff, respectively, the unemployed have an incentive to remain work-free. The newly enlightened UBI proponents believe that a guaranteed basic income would relieve poverty and uncertainty without increasing the number of citizens preferring a government cheque to working. It would free people to pursue more satisfying life choices, to ""prefer the good to the useful ... and cultivate ... the art of life itself and ... not sell themselves for the means of life"", as Keynes put it some 90 years ago.Another policy that has moved from both the left and right fringes of American economics to centre stage is managed trade. China has never worried about such minor matters as the efficient use of the world's resources, preferring a trade policy aimed at creating a nation rich enough to challenge America's global leadership position. And, in the process, eviscerate America's industrial base and decimate many communities.Exit that old standby, free trade, and its cousin, globalisation. We are all Chinese now, although with less malevolent intent. Enter tariffs, higher subsidies to pharmaceutical companies searching for ways to cope with the coronavirus, government intervention to build redundancy into the healthcare system. And, by paying all medical costs of virus victims, whether or not insured, take a step closer to another novel idea, Bernie Sanders' Medicare for All.In sum, policies to balance budgets, maximise incentives to work and take risk, preserve free trade and rely on the existing healthcare system are so yesterday. MMT, UBI, managed trade and de facto healthcare for all are, well, so today.irwin@irwinstelzer.com                   Irwin Stelzer is a business adviser                 ",Web Publication

The announcement on Thursday 16 April comes hours after Mr Raab chaired a Cobra meeting to discuss the current social restrictions in place.The extension has been put in place for ""at least"" three weeks which will take the UK to May 7, when we can expect a second review.Mr Raab, who is deputising for Boris Johnson, said the Government was being ""as open as we responsibly can at this stage"". ""It would not be responsible to prejudge the evidence that Sage will have and review in just a few weeks' time.""The Foreign Secretary said the Government carefully followed what is happening in other countries but ""we've got to do what is right for the British people based on the advice of our experts, grounded in the conditions prevailing here in the UK"".He said that measures put in place had been successful but that SAGE said that some settings were still seeing infections spreading.He warned that relaxing social restrictions now would damage economy in the longterm.•: How other countries are ending lockdown                     Is lockdown working?                     Less than 12 hours after the Prime Minister's historic address to the nation on March 23, the London Underground was jammed with commuters (see video below), while builders were seen eating together in communal canteens, making a mockery of the Government's rule that no more than two people can gather together in public.Professor Susan Michie, Director of the University College London's Centre for Behaviour Change, warned that some people would simply not be able to carry out the measures, even if they wanted to.""Five million self-employed people are being left potentially destitute by the Government failing to offer financial supportas they have done for directly employed workers,"" she said. ""Since [statutory sick pay of] £94 is not enough to pay rent, bills, food for a family etc, they will be forced to carry on as usual.""The British Transport Police is now on hand to make sure only            critical workers are using the London Underground. But such an inauspicious start to the lockdown suggests the virus will spread further than it would have, had stricter measures been implemented earlier,            as they have in other countries. And it means that the measures we do have are likely to be in place for longer to ""flatten the curve"" in a way that would prevent a second dangerous peak.In addition, on April 1 the Government revealed figures that suggested the lockdown was starting to fray as data showed an ""uptick""            in the number of people using transport.The number of those using their cars and public transport, which had been consistently dropping since strict social distancing measures were introduced, rose for the first time.It is feared that sunny weather will prompt more people to break the rules and go outside to socialise as boredom kicks in.•: Can I go for a drive during lockdown?How long will lockdown last?Mr Raab said the Government needed to be satisfied of five things before it would consider it safe to adjust any of the current measures:•Protect the NHS's ability to cope and be confident that the NHS is able to provide sufficient critical care across the UK.•See a sustained and consistent fall in daily death rates to be confident the UK is beyond the peak.•Reliable data from Sage showing rate of infection is decreasing to manageable levels across the board.•Confident that testing capacity and PPE are in hand with supply able to meet future demand.•Confident that any adjustments to the current measures would not risk a second peak in infections which would overwhelm the NHS.When the lockdown was first announced, Professor Mark Woolhouse, Professor of Infectious Disease Epidemiology, University of Edinburgh, said: ""We now enter a phase of careful monitoring. We are looking for indicators first that the epidemic is slowing down and then for numbers of new cases to start to fall. ""After three weeks we will have to decide whether the restrictions need to be continued, can be relaxed, or can be relaxed temporarily with the expectation of imposing them again later. ""We must also monitor the damage that the lockdown is doing; damage to the economy, to education, to psychological well-being and to health and social care provision in the community. The impacts of this epidemic are too far reaching for policy decisions to be driven by epidemiology alone.""Professor Sheila Bird said that more cases in coming weeks would make it easier for the Government to predict how the epidemic is responding to lockdown measures, which will inform how long they remain in place. ""Once an epidemic takes hold, as now in UK, the country's own data - properly reported and interpreted - take precedence over modelling as the data tell us the actual toll which the epidemic is exacting,"" she said.""A huge amount can be inferred about the immediately forthcoming weeks from these data directly, including whether further policy changes are needed to reinforce social-distancing; for example in particular age groups.""Some experts are still concerned that the current restrictions do not go far enough while others say the government has been hit by an ""epidemic of action"", and is now bringing in measures that have little rationale. Professor Robert Dingwall, Professor of Sociology, at Nottingham Trent University, wrote in The Telegraph: ""It is another triumph of populism over science, of a capitulation to the demand to 'do something'. ""We are still seeing some notion that 'the people' are selfish and must be bullied and disciplined. ""The people are not selfish; they have behaved in ways that are individually rational but have collectively irrational results.""However Dr Andrea Collins, Senior Clinical Lecturer in Respiratory Medicine at the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine (LSTM), said: ""I believe that they have not quite gone far enough. The 'absolutely' necessary to go to work is still being used by some when it is not required-I think we need permits across controlled areas to go to a workplace.""Recent modelling from the universities of Exeter, Bristol and Warwick suggested that without any measures at all, the epidemic would have peaked around 133 days after first person-to-person transmission in Britain, which happened around February 28. So the lockdown has the potential of curtailing the spread by around seven weeks. A welcome relief for people who could have been facing lockdown for most of the summer.",Newspaper; Web Publication
449,Nudge theory is a poor substitute for hard science in matters of life or death;Behavioural economics is being abused by politicians as a justification for flawed policies over the coronavirus outbreak,"April 26, 2020 Sunday",International,The Observer (London),1223,1223,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,Sonia Sodha,Nudge theory is a poor substitute for hard science in matters of life or deathBehavioural economics is being abused by politicians as a justification for flawed policies over the coronavirus outbreak,"I first came across ""nudge"" - the concept many consider to be the pinnacle of behavioural economics - at a thinktank seminar a little over 10 years ago. We were all handed a mock wine menu and asked what we'd order.This was supposed to illustrate that most price-aware diners order the second-cheapest bottle to avoid looking tight and that restaurateurs use this to nudge us towards the bottle with the highest markup. I remember thinking it an interesting insight, but that these sorts of nudges were nowhere near as likely to transform the world as their enthusiastic proponent claimed.Lots of far more eminent people disagreed with me. Behavioural economics looks at how people make decisions in the real world - warts, irrational biases and all - and applies this to public policy. Its signature policy is set out in the 2008 book Nudge, by Cass Sunstein and Richard Thaler. The central insight is that changing the way choices are presented to people can have a huge impact. Make saving for retirement or donating your organs an opt-out rather than opt-in and watch as people suddenly adopt more socially responsible behaviour. Coming just as the financial crisis hit, Nudge was perfectly timed to achieve maximum traction by offering politicians the chance to reap savings through low-cost policy. Sunstein was quickly appointed to a senior job in the Obama administration, while David Cameron set up the behavioural insights team, dubbed the ""nudge unit"", led by psychologist turned policy wonk David Halpern.The nudge unit has since had a mixed track record: there have been some real successes on pensions and            tax payments but in other areas it's been a bit of a damp squib. So I was surprised when Halpern popped up to talk about the government's pandemic strategy in the press in early March. It was he who first publicly mentioned the idea of            ""herd immunity"" as part of an effective response to Covid-19 (the government has since denied this was ever the strategy). And it's clear from            the briefing he gave journalists that he favoured delaying a lockdown because of the risk of ""behavioural fatigue"", the idea that people will stick with restrictions for only so long, making it better to save social distancing for when more people are infected. ""If you go too early and tell people to take a week off work when they are very unlikely to have coronavirus, and then a couple of weeks later they have another cough, it's likely they'll say 'come on already',"" he told one reporter.Halpern is reportedly on Sage, the government's scientific advisory committee for emergencies, and he is also the government's What Works national adviser, responsible for helping it apply evidence to public policy. So one might expect there to be something substantial behind the idea of behavioural fatigue.But evidence presented to government by the Sage behavioural subcommittee on 4 March, representing the views of a wider group of experts, was non-committal on the behavioural impact of a lockdown, noting that the empirical evidence on behavioural interventions in a pandemic is limited. Shortly after Halpern's interviews, more than 600 behavioural economists wrote            a letter questioning the evidence base for behavioural fatigue.Rightly so: a rapid evidence review of behavioural science as it relates to pandemics only fleetingly refers to evidence that extending a lockdown might increase non-compliance, but this turns out to be a study about            extending deployment in the armed forces. ""Behavioural fatigue is a nebulous concept,"" the review's authors            later concluded in the Irish Times.This is a common critique of behavioural economics: some (not all) members of the discipline have a tendency to overclaim and overgeneralise, based on small studies carried out in a very different context, often on university students in academic settings. It's extraordinary that Halpern was briefing on what essentially looks like his opinion as if it were science. We won't know how influential it was in the government's decision to            delay lockdown until a post-hoc inquiry, but there's no reason to suppose Boris Johnson wasn't listening to his ""what works"" adviser. ""The behavioural psychologists say that if you don't shake somebody's hand, that sends an important message... [about]            washing your hands,"" he said on 9 March.It's less extraordinary, though, when you understand that the Behavioural Insights Team is a multimillion-pound profitable company, which pays Halpern,            who owns 7.5% of its shares,            a bigger salary than the prime minister. Here lies the potential conflict of interest: someone who contributes to Sage also has a significant financial incentive to sell his wares. It perhaps explains BIT's bombastic claims - ""it's no longer a matter of supposition... we can now say with a high degree of confidence these models give you best policy,""            Halpern claimed in 2018. And: ""We make much of the            simplicity of our interventions... but if properly implemented, they can have a powerful impact on even our biggest societal challenges."" (It is worth noting that Sir Patrick Vallance, the government's chief scientific adviser, says that one reason the composition of Sage has been kept private is to protect scientists from ""           lobbying and other forms of unwanted influence which may hinder their ability to give impartial advice"".)This hubris has led some behavioural scientists to push their approach way beyond those realms such as consumer policy, where it has the potential to be most effective. My jaw dropped on reading a recent 70-page BIT report on applying behavioural insights to domestic abuse that included not one survivor's voice and in which the word ""trauma"" appeared only once. It describes domestic abuse as a ""phenomenon made up of multiple behaviours undertaken by different actors at different points in time"". Its recommendations are that strange mix of common sense dressed up as behavioural revelation and jarring suggestions that tend to characterise behavioural science when it overreaches itself.Little wonder that a House of Lords committee was highly critical of government tendencies to emphasise nudges at the expense of other effective policy solutions in 2011. Nudges undoubtedly have their place, but they're not going to eradicate domestic violence or end catastrophic climate change.The problem with all forms of expertise in public policy is that it is often the most formidable salespeople who claim greater certainty than the evidence allows who are invited to jet around the world advising governments. But the irony for behavioural scientists is that this is a product of them trading off, and falling prey to, the very biases they have made their names calling out.I can only imagine how easy it might have been for Johnson to succumb to confirmation bias in looking for reasons to delay a lockdown: what prime minister wants to shut down the economy?

450,Confusion over travel has become a real problem',"April 26, 2020 Sunday",International,The Independent (United Kingdom),396,396,England & Wales,ROB MERRICK,Confusion over travel has become a real problem',"A government adviser has accused ministers of confusing people by urging them to ""stay at home"" while also quietly allowing more staff back to their workplaces.Aides to Priti Patel, the home secretary, have issued a stinging warning that police could be given beefed-up powers to enforce lockdown measures, claiming a ""small minority"" are flouting the travel ban.But Susan Michie, a health psychologist who sits on the advisory Sage committee, said ministers were creating ""a real problem"" with their ""mixed messages"".In recent days, the government has sanctioned a growing numbers of businesses, including DIY stores, construction firms and takeaway food chains, to reopen - requiring their workers to travel, she said.""What we have seen this last week is that many employers are opening up business again,"" said the professor at University College London. ""We must realise that some people are responding to what they are being asked to do, they are not flouting the rules. It is very, very difficult when we are getting mixed messages from the government - on the one hand stay at home, on the other hand go into non-essential work.""Ms Michie said people had ""a powerful influence"" on each other, telling Sky News: ""It may be that people then think, 'well they are out and about, I think I will go out and about too'. We have a real problem there.""The comments are significant because the professor is a member of the Covid-19 behavioural science advisory group as well as Sage, the scientific advisory group for emergencies.They come as a debate rages in the government and the Conservative Party about when and how to relax restrictions, ahead of Boris Johnson's expected to return to work tomorrow.Traffic levels on the roads have begun creeping up this week and there have been scenes of sizeable crowds in shopping centres and parks in recent days. Motor vehicle use was recorded at 38 per cent of pre-lockdown levels during the first three days of last week - but rose to 41 per cent from Monday to Wednesday this week.But the criticism was rejected by Ms Patel, at yesterday's Downing Street press conference, who said: ""The government message has been clear and consistent from day one about staying at home. We have also been clear that, if you can't work from home, you can go to work. There are no mixed messages. We have been clear, the police have been clear.""",Newspaper

453,"How long will the UK coronavirus lockdown last?;Dominic Raab has extended UK lockdown for a further three weeks and said restrictions will not be lifted until changes can be ""safely"" made","April 26, 2020 Sunday",International,telegraph.co.uk,1100,1100,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,"By Sarah Knapton, Science Editor","How long will the UK coronavirus lockdown last?Dominic Raab has extended UK lockdown for a further three weeks and said restrictions will not be lifted until changes can be ""safely"" made","The Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab has extended UK lockdown measures for a further three weeks to prevent the spread of Covid-19. The announcement on Thursday 16 April comes hours after Mr Raab chaired a Cobra meeting to discuss the current social restrictions in place.The extension has been put in place for ""at least"" three weeks which will take the UK to May 7, when we can expect a second review.Mr Raab, who is deputising for Boris Johnson, said the Government was being ""as open as we responsibly can at this stage"". ""It would not be responsible to prejudge the evidence that Sage will have and review in just a few weeks' time.""The Foreign Secretary said the Government carefully followed what is happening in other countries but ""we've got to do what is right for the British people based on the advice of our experts, grounded in the conditions prevailing here in the UK"".He said that measures put in place had been successful but that SAGE said that some settings were still seeing infections spreading.He warned that relaxing social restrictions now would damage economy in the longterm.•: How other countries are ending lockdown                     Is lockdown working?                     Less than 12 hours after the Prime Minister's historic address to the nation on March 23, the London Underground was jammed with commuters (see video below), while builders were seen eating together in communal canteens, making a mockery of the Government's rule that no more than two people can gather together in public.Professor Susan Michie, Director of the University College London's Centre for Behaviour Change, warned that some people would simply not be able to carry out the measures, even if they wanted to.""Five million self-employed people are being left potentially destitute by the Government failing to offer financial supportas they have done for directly employed workers,"" she said. ""Since [statutory sick pay of] £94 is not enough to pay rent, bills, food for a family etc, they will be forced to carry on as usual.""The British Transport Police is now on hand to make sure only            critical workers are using the London Underground. But such an inauspicious start to the lockdown suggests the virus will spread further than it would have, had stricter measures been implemented earlier,            as they have in other countries. And it means that the measures we do have are likely to be in place for longer to ""flatten the curve"" in a way that would prevent a second dangerous peak.In addition, on April 1 the Government revealed figures that suggested the lockdown was starting to fray as data showed an ""uptick""            in the number of people using transport.The number of those using their cars and public transport, which had been consistently dropping since strict social distancing measures were introduced, rose for the first time.It is feared that sunny weather will prompt more people to break the rules and go outside to socialise as boredom kicks in.•: Can I go for a drive during lockdown?How long will lockdown last?Mr Raab said the Government needed to be satisfied of five things before it would consider it safe to adjust any of the current measures:•Protect the NHS's ability to cope and be confident that the NHS is able to provide sufficient critical care across the UK.•See a sustained and consistent fall in daily death rates to be confident the UK is beyond the peak.•Reliable data from Sage showing rate of infection is decreasing to manageable levels across the board.•Confident that testing capacity and PPE are in hand with supply able to meet future demand.•Confident that any adjustments to the current measures would not risk a second peak in infections which would overwhelm the NHS.When the lockdown was first announced, Professor Mark Woolhouse, Professor of Infectious Disease Epidemiology, University of Edinburgh, said: ""We now enter a phase of careful monitoring. We are looking for indicators first that the epidemic is slowing down and then for numbers of new cases to start to fall. ""After three weeks we will have to decide whether the restrictions need to be continued, can be relaxed, or can be relaxed temporarily with the expectation of imposing them again later. ""We must also monitor the damage that the lockdown is doing; damage to the economy, to education, to psychological well-being and to health and social care provision in the community. The impacts of this epidemic are too far reaching for policy decisions to be driven by epidemiology alone.""Professor Sheila Bird said that more cases in coming weeks would make it easier for the Government to predict how the epidemic is responding to lockdown measures, which will inform how long they remain in place. ""Once an epidemic takes hold, as now in UK, the country's own data - properly reported and interpreted - take precedence over modelling as the data tell us the actual toll which the epidemic is exacting,"" she said.""A huge amount can be inferred about the immediately forthcoming weeks from these data directly, including whether further policy changes are needed to reinforce social-distancing; for example in particular age groups.""Some experts are still concerned that the current restrictions do not go far enough while others say the government has been hit by an ""epidemic of action"", and is now bringing in measures that have little rationale. Professor Robert Dingwall, Professor of Sociology, at Nottingham Trent University, wrote in The Telegraph: ""It is another triumph of populism over science, of a capitulation to the demand to 'do something'. ""We are still seeing some notion that 'the people' are selfish and must be bullied and disciplined. ""The people are not selfish; they have behaved in ways that are individually rational but have collectively irrational results.""However Dr Andrea Collins, Senior Clinical Lecturer in Respiratory Medicine at the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine (LSTM), said: ""I believe that they have not quite gone far enough. The 'absolutely' necessary to go to work is still being used by some when it is not required-I think we need permits across controlled areas to go to a workplace.""Recent modelling from the universities of Exeter, Bristol and Warwick suggested that without any measures at all, the epidemic would have peaked around 133 days after first person-to-person transmission in Britain, which happened around February 28. So the lockdown has the potential of curtailing the spread by around seven weeks. A welcome relief for people who could have been facing lockdown for most of the summer.",Newspaper; Web Publication
454,"Easing UK lockdown would require tough rules, says adviser;Economist says strict measures needed to avoid pubs and shops getting too busyCoronavirus - latest updatesSee all our coronavirus coverage","April 27, 2020 Monday",International,The Guardian (London),835,835,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,Luke Harding,"Easing UK lockdown would require tough rules, says adviserEconomist says strict measures needed to avoid pubs and shops getting too busyCoronavirus - latest updatesSee all our coronavirus coverage","An economist who has been advising the government over how to ease the national lockdown has said pubs, shops and restaurants could reopen as long as there was mandatory physical distancing and fines for those abusing the rules.Speaking to the Guardian, Eyal Winter said ministers could allow a broader resumption of activity, but only if it was accompanied by a stricter level of enforcement.Winter said the Cabinet Office was deeply concerned that some people would behave inappropriately as soon as lockdown was ended. One fear was that pubs would get very full. ""People are starving for pubs. They are an important part of British culture,"" he said.Winter, an economist at Lancaster University, is part of a team of behavioural experts who have been advising the government since April.His views have been shared with the cabinet office as ministers consider a range of options for how the UK might emerge from the coronavirus crisis.Winter said he opposed opening up the UK economy sector by sector. He has argued his blueprint would be more equitable than a gradual easing of restrictions, which could fuel resentment among those still unable to work.He said the government should follow a German-style approach, with clear dates and targets. ""One of the most important things is to have a programme, to say, 'in two weeks we will do such and such',"" he said. ""You need to make the rules crystal clear, and to explain to the public the rationale behind each one of them.""He was sceptical that official ""nudge"" warnings would keep people out of bars, putting them at risk of getting the virus or unwittingly passing it to others. One solution would be for landlords to ration how much beer they serve, to two or three pints, he said. Customers would then be politely asked to go home.Landlords and shop owners should be tasked with enforcing these new rules and to monitoring customer numbers, he said.He envisaged theatres and cinemas would also reopen but sell half as many tickets as before, with gaps in seating. Prices could be raised to cover revenue shortfalls.A similar empty ""middle-seat"" policy was likely to be introduced on planes, he said. Travel would restart with a ""low version of social distancing"". Winter was dismissive of Michael O'Leary, the boss of Ryanair, who last week said he wouldn't bother flying his planes in this ""idiotic"" scenario. Winter pointed to the recent collapse in the global oil price. Restrictions ""wouldn't be for eternity"", he stressed.Some changes, such as the use of Zoom and other homeworking technologies, were good, he said. Overall, Winter said he was confident the world would eventually return to its pre-virus state. This would probably take two years, assuming the planet avoided future pandemics.""Some people have an apocalyptic view of this. I'm old enough to remember 9/11. We had exactly the same impression afterwards then. We thought: 'It's over. We will lock ourselves in shelters. We will stop flying.' It never happened,"" he pointed out. He added: ""It will take a lot of time to move back to January 2020. But we will get there.""Winter - who is also a professor at the Hebrew University's centre for the study of rationality - was speaking from his home between Jerusalem and Tel Aviv. He has also been advising the government in Israel, where the death toll from coronavirus has been significantly lower than in the UK. He is due to hold further discussions on Tuesday with the Cabinet Office's behavioural science group. The group feeds policy ideas to government. Not all are accepted, Winter said.Another prominent adviser to the Cabinet Office is Daniel Kahneman, the Israeli-American economist and Nobel laureate, celebrated for his work on the psychology of judgement and decision making. Kahneman declined to comment.Winter said that the group had discussed the gruelling psychological toll that lockdown was having on individuals. Some were ""taking more risks"". Others were experiencing high levels of anxiety, which left them open to being scammed or to going on irrational spending sprees.He predicted that crime and violence were likely to jump once the lockdown was over. He also anticipated a period of social division, with grievances among those who felt they had suffered more than others. Branding some workers essential and others superfluous was unwise. This could leave citizens feeling they had been treated unfairly, he said.The Cabinet Office confirmed its team had spoken to Winter about exit lockdown strategy. It said the government sought advice from a wide range of experts including academics, healthcare professionals and business leaders.Boris Johnson has been reluctant to explain his thinking on how the lockdown might end. This is causing frustration among some Tory MPs, as well as to millions of workers who have seen their incomes evaporate. The UK's position is increasingly anomalous: other European countries            have revealed timetable s for the reopening of schools and non-essential businesses.",Newspaper

However, a scientist on a sub-committee of the Government's Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) board, has called for ""more reformed and nuanced"" guidance. Susan Michie, professor of health psychology and sirector of the Centre for Behaviour Change at UCL, said: ""The guidance is based on averages, and as we know there's huge individual differences for every average.""So there are many 70 and 80-year-olds that are much fitter and healthier than those who are a lot younger. I think the problem is that if people don't perceive the guidance to be proportionate to their own situation there will be problems with adherence, and we now know more about who is at risk and the whole progress of the disease."" Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Prof Michie said ""individual data"" based on age, gender and underlying health conditions could help people find out how much additional risk they are exposed to should they contract the virus. ""Communities and people do want to be involved in decision-making,"" she said. ""I think this is incredibly important going forward for this issue, but also for all issues, that communities are properly consulted, properly engaged, properly involved in decision-making about how we go forward in what's going to be a very complicated terrain of [easing] restrictions.""Last week, The Telegraph reported that ministers are looking to restart the economy using a ""traffic light"" system, with the over-70s ""stuck on red for months"" - potentially up to a year - until a mass-produced vaccine is available. Prof Michie, whose research focuses on developing the science of behaviour change interventions and applying behavioural science to those interventions, said that, when the Government reviews its guidance, it should ""take this on board and make sure people are given the information to make sensible decisions about their own lives"". She added: ""One of the great things about the progress of medicine is that we have so many fit and active, young at heart 70 and 80-year-olds, and I think that that must be recognised. We have much more information now than we had when the guidance was originally given out, and I think it could become more reformed and nuanced now.""Caroline Abrahams, the charity director at Age UK, said: ""When it comes old age, there is definitely no one size that fits all. There are enormous differences in the health of the older population. We all know fortunate individuals who seem as fit as many half their age, while others really struggle when many of their contemporaries continue to do well. ""A long period of lockdown would have enormous practical implications for older people, including the rising numbers who want or need to keep working, and all who care for their grandchildren too. There are also the potentially devastating mental health consequences to take into account if older people are advised to stay apart from family and friends for many months - a recipe for misery and loneliness.""Government decisions about the lockdown that impact on all older people above a certain age on a compulsory basis, regarding of their health status, are unlikely to be acceptable or, it seems, particularly helpful in helping the country to transition back to a more normal way of life. ""Older people should be able to make up their own minds, armed with best information and the clearest evidence-based advice the Government is able to provide.""The Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) has been contacted for comment.

456,"Why shouldn't Dominic Cummings attend science advisers' coronavirus meetings?;There has been outrage and unease over the PM's chief adviser, but he's hardly a unique case, writes Sean O'Grady","April 27, 2020 Monday",International,The Independent (United Kingdom),635,635,England & Wales,Sean O'Grady,"Why shouldn't Dominic Cummings attend science advisers' coronavirus meetings?There has been outrage and unease over the PM's chief adviser, but he's hardly a unique case, writes Sean O'Grady","                     Dominic Cummings, officially the prime minister's chief adviser, semi-official chief misfit and unofficial Svengali, provokes strong feelings. As the man who, arguably, won the EU referendum for Leave, this is inevitable. David Cameron, who experienced his disruptive ways first-hand when Cummings worked for Michael Gove at the education department, called him a serial psychopath. Theresa May banished him from Whitehall. Boris Johnson has embraced him, to the unease of many, even in Tory circles. So the revelation that this inquisitive, brooding, menacing figure, plus a sidekick named Ben Warner, had been attending meetings of the Scientific Advisory Group on Emergencies (Sage) was bound to cause a stir. The argument runs that he may have had a chilling effect on free discussion, and that full members of Sage - Cummings was only an attendee - found it worrying that he was parked in on their proceedings. The allegation is that Cummings's interventions sometimes inappropriately influenced what is supposed to be impartial independent advice. In Cummings's defence, he and the PM may have been hugely better informed about the pandemic as a result. Indeed the eventual imposition of a partial lock down last month - which has thus far worked - is said to have been down to a ""Domescene"" moment of realisation when the Sage discussed Imperial College's terrifying estimates of potential casualty levels. Does anyone care? Certainly the issue is what Westminster calls ""process"" rather than substance. While it is true that advisers such as Cummings have rarely if ever attended such specialist committees, that does not necessarily make it a bad thing. Moreover, prime ministerial aides do not have to sit on any particular body to exert influence, benign or otherwise. For example, various enquiries into the lead-up to the Iraq war of 2003 demonstrated how figures such Alastair Campbell and Jonathan Powell interacted with the intelligence apparatus, because of their close relationship with Tony Blair.                      Would it be better or worse if Cummings had little or no role in the process of decision-making? Is that even realistic? Prime ministers going back to David Lloyd George have always had their own experts, mavericks, cronies and weirdos populating kitchen cabinets, and all interfering with the formal processes of cabinet government, provoking periodic rows and resignations. The matter has, though, acquired an additional cloak and dagger aspect because of the spurious attempt to keep the membership of Sage quiet; it is not secret, but it is unpublished. The members such as Chris Whitty, chief medical officer, don't care who knows they serve on it, but it is not their job to reveal the names. By contrast we know who is on the Cobra group they advise. We also know who is on Nervtag (the New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group) that reports to Sage; but the membership of two other Sage sub-groups is not public. We don't know who sits on SPI-B, the behavioural science group (Independent Scientific Pandemic Influenza Group on Behaviours). Nor is it known who is on the SPI-M, the Scientific Pandemic Influenza Group on Modelling. The policy of naming the shifting membership of these groups is inconsistent, and invites suspicion. In truth, this alphabet soup of geeks and boffins is probably of little interest to the public - so long as they are getting things right, or leastways more right than wrong. Thus far, and despite some unforgivable failures, the worst case scenarios for Covid-19 have not materialised. The hospitals did not run out of intensive care beds or ventilators, nor were they overwhelmed. A peak of infections and deaths has been passed. For now, who sits on what committee feels like a secondary issue. ",Newspaper; Web Publication

A proportion of these may not have had Covid-19 themselves, but could have died because of effects of the lockdown, such as reduced access to medical facilities.Sir Patrick was speaking after some of the names on the Scientific Advisory Group on Emergencies (Sage) were leaked to                    The Guardian                   , amid criticism that Boris Johnson was claiming to ""follow the science"" while being opaque about the source of that science.He promised to release the names of around 100 scientists who are guiding the government's coronavirus response but defended the secrecy around Sage, saying it was vital that people can speak their minds.Those revealed to be sitting on the committee included Brooke Rogers, a behavioural scientist, John Edmunds and Graham Medley, disease specialists, as well as Dominic Cummings, Mr Johnson's chief political advisor,                    The Guardian                   reported. The inclusion of Mr Cummings was heavily criticised over the weekend.Sir David King, himself a former chief scientific advisor, said that he was ""shocked"" by Mr Cummings's inclusion. However, speaking to reporters both Sir Patrick and Sir Mark Walport, another former chief scientific advisor, said that it was entirely normal to have political appointees present, and that Sir David's tenure preceded the creation of Sage.""We also have officials from Whitehall who listen in to the meetings and can ask questions if they wish,"" said Sir Patrick. ""And yes, that does include people from Number 10.""Sage is not a fixed committee. Instead, it draws on expertise relevant to the particular emergency. In the case of coronavirus, it is fed by a number of smaller committees, looking at, among other things, mathematical modelling and virology. Sir Patrick said that he intends to release the names of those on any of the committees, provided that they consent.""The usual practice with Sage is that the names of the scientists involved are published after the emergency is over,"" he said. ""We were very strongly advised that that needed to be the case here for a number of reasons, including the fact that this is an issue of independence and people being influenced, but also for personal security reasons . . . but we will be publishing names of those that are happy to have their names published."" He said he that expected there to be around 100.This may not assuage critics. Tracey Brown is director Sense About Science, a charity that campaigns for openness in data and science. ""I don't see a case for anonymity,"" she said. ""An unpleasant post bag is standard fare when you serve on a powerful committee. Looked at in the context of how blurred the line is between scientific advice and political responsibility, it's hard not to conclude that this is more about government wanting to avoid awkward conversations about their reasoning than about threats to scientists.""She also argued that it was counterproductive. ""The secrecy is utterly patronising to the public. Government is effectively saying: 'You must follow our rules, we're led by science, but you can't know whose science or which scientists are included in that.' Not surprisingly, it has done more for conspiracy mongering than David Icke could ever do.""Sir Patrick resisted calls to release the group's minutes, however. ""One of the difficult roles of giving science advice in government of course is you have to be able to give that advice directly to ministers, so that they will have a chance to make the decisions that they need to make.""It's very difficult to do that if everything we're discussing immediately is public, and immediately gets visibility before anyone is able to make a decision. That's the nature of scientific advice.""",Newspaper; Web Publication
458,"The government's secret science group has a shocking lack of expertise;Sage has no molecular virologists, immunologists or intensive care experts. This could have cost thousands of lives","April 27, 2020 Monday",International,The Guardian (London),986,986,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,Anthony Costello,"The government's secret science group has a shocking lack of expertiseSage has no molecular virologists, immunologists or intensive care experts. This could have cost thousands of lives","The success of any advisory group of scientists surely depends on a culture of openness, independence and diversity of opinion. Unfortunately this culture of openness has been conspicuous by its absence when it comes to the government's Scientific Advisory Group on Emergencies. It's only through the persistence of Guardian journalists that we can now identify           23 participants in Sage. Of these, 13 are paid government employees, working as ministerial, health or civil service advisers. As such, the presence of their bosses, Patrick Vallance and Chris Whitty, to say nothing of the prime ministers's most senior adviser, Dominic Cummings, might well influence their ability to speak freely.Beyond that, what does the membership of this committee actually tell us? We've learned from the list of attendees at a crucial Sage meeting on 23 March, leaked to the Guardian, that the group includes seven clinical academics, three microbiologists, seven modellers, two behavioural scientists with backgrounds in disasters and terrorism, one geneticist, one civil servant and two political advisers, one of which is the most powerful prime ministerial lieutenant in recent memory.The makeup of Sage reflects an oddly skewed and overwhelmingly medical view of science. Indeed, there are many other perspectives that could bring value to a pandemic crisis team. Did Sage consult public health epidemiologists at the frontline of the response to coronavirus in China or Hong Kong, such as Prof Gabriel Leung? Did the group get input from infectious experts at the World Health Organization, such as the epidemiologist Mike Ryan, who leads the team responsible for containing of Covid-19 across the world?The group includes no molecular virologists who could explain detailed pathogenic differences between Covid-19 and influenza, not one intensive care expert or nursing leader, and no immunologist to examine whether this virus produces lasting and protective immunity. There are no social scientists who could work on community engagement, nor a logistician, who would have expertise in planning for the delivery of supplies and resources during a pandemic. A balanced scientific advisory group would at the minimum include experts working at the frontline of the pandemic, such as those in public health, primary care and intensive care.As to other measures of diversity, the gender balance of Sage is predictably skewed, with 16 men to seven women and only one ethnic minority person. Given that coronavirus has been shown to disproportionately affect people from black and ethnic minority communities, the comparative lack of black and ethnic minority experts seems a troubling omission.In the absence of meeting minutes, we may never know whether, despite these deficiencies, a culture of openness exists within Sage. The lack of a paper trail also makes two of the group's most important decisions particularly difficult to understand. At its first meeting on 28 January, Sage didn't ask its mathematical modellers to model a community testing programme. Community testing and contact tracing reportedly wasn't included as a possible strategy in the original modelling because not enough tests were available.  The UK had been among the first countries to develop a Covid-19 test in mid-January, approved by the WHO, and has an exceptional national research infrastructure. Yet our national capacity to respond to a pandemic challenge appears to have been ignored. The basic principles of public health, and the daily mantra of the WHO - to find the virus, test, trace and isolate, to promote social distancing, and to do it all at speed - appear to have been effectively disregarded.Whatever was discussed by Sage during February led to an alternative strategy, laid out by Boris Johnson, Vallance and Whitty at the beginning of March: to move from containing the virus to delaying its spread, allowing it to move through the population so that we eventually acquire ""herd immunity"" at a delayed speed.So at a moment when the UK had fewer than 10 deaths from Covid-19 and less than 500 confirmed cases of coronavirus, the government, informed by Sage, decided to stop all community testing and tracing. The public health community were perplexed. It is difficult to think of other severe viral epidemics managed in this way, apart from influenza, which differs from coronvirus in important ways.Six weeks later, the approach favoured by the WHO - testing, tracing and isolating the virus - is ostensibly back on the agenda. Matt Hancock has pledged that the UK will deliver 100,000 tests a day by the end of this week, with the army, Deloitte, Serco and Boots setting up test centres across the country. Health workers and their families can sign up for tests immediately. All hospital patients will be tested. Yet the government is bypassing the local authority public health teams and GPs who are at the forefront of routine screening and testing in the NHS and local communities. Its strategy still appears to be about flattening the curve, rather than finding every case of coronavirus.Without testing, tracing those who have come into contact with infected people and isolating these clusters, the virus will flare up again. Future lockdowns will be necessary, and economic recovery extremely difficult. In a month's time, we could be heading towards 60,000 deaths or more. It's impossible to tell whether things would have played out differently had Sage included people from public health and primary care backgrounds. But had its membership and details of its decisions been revealed earlier, there would have been a chance for the wider scientific community to offer constructive criticism, maybe in time to save thousands of lives.

461,UK to name scientists on coronavirus advisory group Sage;Makeup of group to be made public after political advisers revealed to be in attendanceCoronavirus - latest updatesSee all our coronavirus coverage,"April 27, 2020 Monday",International,The Guardian (London),991,991,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,"Ian Sample, Severin Carrell and David Pegg",UK to name scientists on coronavirus advisory group SageMakeup of group to be made public after political advisers revealed to be in attendanceCoronavirus - latest updatesSee all our coronavirus coverage,"The names of scientists advising ministers on the coronavirus epidemic are to be made public this week in an effort to boost transparency around the government's decision-making process.The UK government's chief scientific adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance, who chairs the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), made the announcement on Monday, shortly before Scotland's first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, said there had been a ""deficiency"" in the system providing scientific advice.Sturgeon said she had been unhappy since the start of the coronavirus crisis that the chief scientist for the Scottish government did not have full participation rights in Sage meetings.Vallance said membership of Sage and the subcommittees that fed into it would be published shortly, although individual members could ask to remain anonymous. The Guardian understands scientific advisers were emailed over the weekend and given the chance to ""opt out"" of being named in public.The makeup of the largely secretive advisory group has come under intense scrutiny amid concerns that ministers have fumbled critical aspects of Britain's pandemic response while insisting that they are following ""the best science"".Last week, the Guardian revealed that the prime minister's chief political adviser, Dominic Cummings, and a data scientist he worked with on the Vote Leave campaign for Brexit, have been participating in Sage meetings. Downing Street has played down their involvement, saying they are largely silent observers.However, others on Sage have said they were shocked, concerned and worried about the impartiality of advice when they discovered No 10 political advisers would be taking part.Vallance told journalists on Monday he was strongly advised to keep the Sage membership secret to ensure the independence and personal security of the scientists on the group. The membership of Sage differs for each emergency and has varied from meeting to meeting during the coronavirus outbreak.Historically, the names of the advisers had been published after a crisis had ended, he said, adding it was unclear when that point would be reached in dealing with the coronavirus. ""I believe we should be more prepared to publish names sooner, and intend to do so shortly,"" he said. ""We will be publishing the names of those that are happy to have their names published.""The number of named advisers is expected to reach 100 individuals. Twenty or so sit on Sage, with the rest participating in formal sub-groups or ad hoc teams set up to investigate particular issues.The sub-groups include 45 people on the Scientific Pandemic Influenza Group on Modelling (Spi-M) and 18 on the Scientific Pandemic Influenza Group on Behaviours (Spi-B). Others come from the Covid-19 clinical information network and the New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group (Nervtag).Vallance said Sage had met 28 times since its first meeting on 22 January, with early meetings flagging the need to increase testing and the potential for the virus to spread through hospitals and care homes. Vallance said there was interest in the Sage meetings across Whitehall from early on. Many people were listening in from ""various departments"", but they were not part of the general discussion. ""That does include people from No 10 and, yes, occasionally they ask questions.""Political advisers from Downing Street have never attended Sage meetings before, according to a review of all publicly available minutes of meetings over the last decade.Sir David King, a former chief scientific adviser, said he would not have allowed political advisers to attend his advisory meetings.""Dominic Cummings has the ear of the prime minister, so who is informing the prime minister about scientific advice?"" he asked. ""Is it Cummings or is it the chief scientific adviser? Suddenly you get a confusion. There must be a single voice taking the view of the scientific community to the prime minister, that is the most important thing.""Vallance said he had ""no way of knowing"" whether Cummings was sharing his own interpretations of Sage discussions with Johnson. ""All I'm worried about is that the prime minister hears Sage advice from me. I can't tell who else he is hearing scientific advice from.""At a briefing in Edinburgh, Sturgeon said the exclusion of scientists from the devolved administrations from Sage had prompted her to set up her own panel of advisers. The Scottish, Welsh and Northern Irish governments do not have full membership of Sage.Sturgeon said she felt some time ago this policy meant she was unable to directly question or test the scientific and technical advice being presented, undermining her ability to find the right policies for Scotland.That situation improved, she said, when she appointed Prof Andrew Morris, a Sage member and a medical data scientist at the University of Edinburgh, to lead a Scottish science advisory group that reports directly to her. Morriswas formerly the part-time chief scientific adviser to the Scottish government's health department.""We now have a situation where the chair of the advisory group here in Scotland does participate fully in Sage, and that has helped to, I think, deal with a deficiency that I certainly felt was there at the outset,"" Sturgeon said during her daily coronavirus briefing.She said the new advisory group allowed her to ""augment"" the high quality and ""very helpful"" advice from Sage. Sturgeon said she had to have the ""ability as first minister, as the chief decision-maker in the Scottish government, to interrogate directly some of that advice and to have somebody that I could ask questions of, so that my understanding of it is as it needs to be, and that wasn't, I felt, the case earlier on with Sage."" This article was amended on 7 May 2020 because an earlier version said that Morris is the part-time chief scientific adviser to the Scottish government's health department. He formerly held that role.",Newspaper
462,"Government advisers divided on how to handle key aspects of coronavirus crisis, Sage chairman says;Sir Patrick Vallance, chairman of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies, said there had been 'heated and prolonged' discussions","April 27, 2020 Monday",International,telegraph.co.uk,899,899,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,"By Laura Donnelly, Health Editor","Government advisers divided on how to handle key aspects of coronavirus crisis, Sage chairman saysSir Patrick Vallance, chairman of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies, said there had been 'heated and prolonged' discussions","The Government's advisers are divided on how best to handle key aspects of the coronavirus crisis, the chairman of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) has said. Sir Patrick Vallance said there had been ""heated and prolonged"" discussions-in particular about the scientific evidence about whether the public should wear face masks, with Government advice still awaited. He also cast doubt on ministers' hopes that it will be possible to issue members of the public with ""immunity passports"" showing they were protected against the virus.Ministers have repeatedly said that their response to coronavirus-and the use of social distancing measures-is ""led by science"".But Sir Patrick, the Government's chief scientific adviser, suggested that there is limited consensus among more than 100 scientists informing the Government's response. He also promised to publish a list of those on the Government's Sage committee, and its subgroups, amid growing concerns about a lack of transparency over its operations.Last week it emerged that its meetings have been attended by Dominic Cummings, the Prime Minister's senior aide, prompting concern that the committee might be being subjected to political pressure.On Monday, Sir Patrick said Whitehall officials were able to ""listen in"" to meetings and ask questions, but insisted they were ""not part of the general discussion"".He said that while the identities of experts advising Government were not normally disclosed until after an emergency is over, he intended to be more transparent. ""I believe that we should be more prepared to publish names sooner, and intend to do so shortly. So we will be publishing names of those that are happy to have their names published."" He said the group would also release a list of any papers it had considered, eventually publishing the research itself.Sir Patrick also defended Sage's record, saying that following its first meeting, back in January, the committee urged ministers to ramp up testing.Yet in March, routine testing was abandoned and restricted largely to hospital cases.An expansion of testing to staff and key workers was only introduced in recent weeks, after the Health Secretary pledged to ensure 100,000 tests a day were carried out by the end of thismonth. Sir Patrick revealed fierce debate between scientists about policies to tackle the spread of the virus.In a briefing on Monday, he said: ""The weaker the evidence and the more controversial it is the more heated and prolonged the discussions are, and the more opinion becomes the dominant feature.""""The challenge is not to allow the dominant voices to become the ones that necessarily win the argument on that,"" he said, ""because it has to be one that's based on evidence as far as we can"".He described recent discussions about the scientific evidence to support face-mask wearing by the general public as a ""classic example"" of such debate. ""We had several meetings to discuss the evidence; the evidence is quite difficult to interpret because it's not very strong.""""We've given advice to ministers for them to make policy decisions on the back of it, and ... we've also been really clear where the uncertainty lies,"" he said, saying it was down to ministers to make a judgement.Sir Patrick said it was ""absolutely clear"" that the use of ""high-grade"" medical face masks was crucial in healthcare settings, and must not be compromised by any decision to suggest the public could benefit from any kind of facial covering. He said: ""There are certain types of face masks that actually are much simpler to procure to use which could be beneficial but, we've given our thoughts on that, then ministers will make decisions on what they would like to do.""He also said there was uncertainty among scientists about the strength of people's immunity following infection. Last week, the World Health Organisation said there is currently ""no evidence that people who have recovered from Covid-19 and have antibodies are protected from a second infection"".But Sir Patrick suggested there was broad agreement among Sage's advisers that some immunity is likely to be conferred-though not enough to be confident that immunity passports could be issued, as ministers have suggested. ""There is quite a strong consensus that most people get antibodies, and those antibodies are likely to be protective in some form, although we can't be sure to the exact degree,"" he said. The scientist suggested that the debate swung from ""thinking nobody becomes immune"" to ""thinking that you've got something as clear and straightforward as an immunity passport that everyone could just go around waving"" when the truth was likely to fall between the two.On Monday, Prof Susan Michie, a member of one of Sage's sub committees, suggested that blanket advice to over 70s to stay at home could not be maintained when restrictions are eased.Prof Michie, professor of health psychology at University College London, called for ""more reformed and nuanced"" guidance to take account of differences within age groups. She said: ""There are many 70 and 80-year-olds that are much fitter and healthier than those who are a lot younger. I think the problem is that if people don't perceive the guidance to be proportionate to their own situation there will be problems with adherence, and we now know more about who is at risk and the whole progress of the disease.""

The announcement on Thursday 16 April comes hours after Mr Raab chaired a Cobra meeting to discuss the current social restrictions in place.The extension has been put in place for ""at least"" three weeks which will take the UK to May 7, when we can expect a second review.Mr Raab, who deputised for Boris Johnson, said the Government was being ""as open as we responsibly can at this stage"". ""It would not be responsible to prejudge the evidence that Sage will have and review in just a few weeks' time.""The Foreign Secretary said the Government carefully followed what is happening in other countries but ""we've got to do what is right for the British people based on the advice of our experts, grounded in the conditions prevailing here in the UK"".He said that measures put in place had been successful but that SAGE said that some settings were still seeing infections spreading.He warned that relaxing social restrictions now would damage economy in the longterm.•: How other countries are ending lockdown                     Is lockdown working?                     Less than 12 hours after the Prime Minister's historic address to the nation on March 23, the London Underground was jammed with commuters (see video below), while builders were seen eating together in communal canteens, making a mockery of the Government's rule that no more than two people can gather together in public.Professor Susan Michie, Director of the University College London's Centre for Behaviour Change, warned that some people would simply not be able to carry out the measures, even if they wanted to.""Five million self-employed people are being left potentially destitute by the Government failing to offer financial supportas they have done for directly employed workers,"" she said. ""Since [statutory sick pay of] £94 is not enough to pay rent, bills, food for a family etc, they will be forced to carry on as usual.""The British Transport Police is now on hand to make sure only            critical workers are using the London Underground. But such an inauspicious start to the lockdown suggests the virus will spread further than it would have, had stricter measures been implemented earlier,            as they have in other countries. And it means that the measures we do have are likely to be in place for longer to ""flatten the curve"" in a way that would prevent a second dangerous peak.In addition, on April 1 the Government revealed figures that suggested the lockdown was starting to fray as data showed an ""uptick""            in the number of people using transport.The number of those using their cars and public transport, which had been consistently dropping since strict social distancing measures were introduced, rose for the first time.It is feared that sunny weather will prompt more people to break the rules and go outside to socialise as boredom kicks in.•: Can I go for a drive during lockdown?How long will lockdown last?Mr Raab said the Government needed to be satisfied of five things before it would consider it safe to adjust any of the current measures:•Protect the NHS's ability to cope and be confident that the NHS is able to provide sufficient critical care across the UK.•See a sustained and consistent fall in daily death rates to be confident the UK is beyond the peak.•Reliable data from Sage showing rate of infection is decreasing to manageable levels across the board.•Confident that testing capacity and PPE are in hand with supply able to meet future demand.•Confident that any adjustments to the current measures would not risk a second peak in infections which would overwhelm the NHS.When the lockdown was first announced, Professor Mark Woolhouse, Professor of Infectious Disease Epidemiology, University of Edinburgh, said: ""We now enter a phase of careful monitoring. We are looking for indicators first that the epidemic is slowing down and then for numbers of new cases to start to fall. ""After three weeks we will have to decide whether the restrictions need to be continued, can be relaxed, or can be relaxed temporarily with the expectation of imposing them again later. ""We must also monitor the damage that the lockdown is doing; damage to the economy, to education, to psychological well-being and to health and social care provision in the community. The impacts of this epidemic are too far reaching for policy decisions to be driven by epidemiology alone.""Professor Sheila Bird said that more cases in coming weeks would make it easier for the Government to predict how the epidemic is responding to lockdown measures, which will inform how long they remain in place. ""Once an epidemic takes hold, as now in UK, the country's own data - properly reported and interpreted - take precedence over modelling as the data tell us the actual toll which the epidemic is exacting,"" she said.""A huge amount can be inferred about the immediately forthcoming weeks from these data directly, including whether further policy changes are needed to reinforce social-distancing; for example in particular age groups.""Some experts are still concerned that the current restrictions do not go far enough while others say the government has been hit by an ""epidemic of action"", and is now bringing in measures that have little rationale. Professor Robert Dingwall, Professor of Sociology, at Nottingham Trent University, wrote in The Telegraph: ""It is another triumph of populism over science, of a capitulation to the demand to 'do something'. ""We are still seeing some notion that 'the people' are selfish and must be bullied and disciplined. ""The people are not selfish; they have behaved in ways that are individually rational but have collectively irrational results.""However Dr Andrea Collins, Senior Clinical Lecturer in Respiratory Medicine at the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine (LSTM), said: ""I believe that they have not quite gone far enough. The 'absolutely' necessary to go to work is still being used by some when it is not required-I think we need permits across controlled areas to go to a workplace.""Recent modelling from the universities of Exeter, Bristol and Warwick suggested that without any measures at all, the epidemic would have peaked around 133 days after first person-to-person transmission in Britain, which happened around February 28. So the lockdown has the potential of curtailing the spread by around seven weeks. A welcome relief for people who could have been facing lockdown for most of the summer.",Newspaper; Web Publication

Urging ministers to ""address inconsistencies head on"", Prof Michie suggested the Government should do more to engage people in discussion about possible ways out of lockdown.She told MPs on the Science and Technology Committee that some attempts to communicate with the public had ""been received as mixed messages"".In some cases, this was because ""different ministers are saying slightly different things"", Prof Michie said, even if they intended to convey the same point. ""Once people get confused by messages, then people get anxious and distrustful and it can get into a vicious circle,"" she said. In recent weeks, ministers have given their own interpretations of Government advice, with Michael Gove at one point suggesting a daily run should last no more than 30 minutes and a walk no more than an hour, although official guidance does not set time limits on daily exercise. Ministers have said only ""essential"" travel can be justified, while guidance issued by the Crown Prosecution Service says people are able to drive to the countryside for a walk but only if that walk is longer than the drive.Prof Michie, professor of health psychology at University College London, sits on Sage's sub-committee on behaviours. She said apparent conflicts between different aspects of advice were also undermining the Government's messages.""On the one hand, people are being told to stay at home because we must have no transmission - you can't even see your children or grandchildren,"" she added.She said that, on the other hand, there are ""thousands of people coming in through airports every day without screening, alongside what is seen as non-essential work, building work - building luxury hotels... selling a whole variety of products that aren't deemed as essential.""Prof Michie suggested seeds of distrust were sown if the public thought the policy ""doesn't add up"" and warned that such reactions - and a perception that policies were unfair - could undermine adherence to demands to maintain social distancing.However, she stressed that the public's adherence to social distancing measures has been better than anticipated.She said: ""I think it's been phenomenal, I think it's been more than most people expected, I think it's a tribute to the British public.""Once people see the seriousness of the situation, and when there is an appeal to collective solidarity - which I think has been done very effectively - I think people rise to that occasion.""The messages that have been especially about protecting people, protecting the NHS, have really had a big impact. There has been a great degree of altruism, which I think has been really heartwarming.""The psychologist has previously suggested that, when the lockdown is lifted, blanket advice to over-70s to stay at home should not be maintained.She said that when there were ""grey areas"" to address, such as whether a healthy and fit person in their 70s might have less risk than an unhealthier younger person, and it was better for the Government to set out the principles behind its thinking. Prof Michie added that ""one can't start too early"" in engaging the public in discussion about future policies, calling for ""good communication well in advance"" of any shifts in advice. Danny Altmann, professor of immunology at Imperial College London, told the committee he would be ""terribly worried"" about lifting lockdown measures with limited knowledge of the population's immunity to coronavirus.He said: ""As an immunologist, and knowing how desperately lethal this virus can be, I'd be very worried about any assumptions on those grounds - terribly worried. For a virus we've known about since January, it's been a very steep learning curve.""Prof Altmann said a better understanding of immunity in the population could help ease the current restrictions on leaving the home and told MPs: ""Without really good antibody testing and seroprevalence in the population, we're flying blind.""We haven't got a clue who's had it, how many have had it, where they've had it, or where we stand for the future for second waves, so I can't emphasise sufficiently how desperately we need that data and how widely we need that data.""",Newspaper; Web Publication
465,Why shouldn't Cummings attend Sage meetings?,"April 28, 2020 Tuesday",International,The Independent (United Kingdom),626,626,England & Wales,SEAN O'GRADY,Why shouldn't Cummings attend Sage meetings?,"Dominic Cummings, officially the prime minister's chief adviser, semi-official chief misfit and unofficial Svengali, provokes strong feelings. As the man who, arguably, won the EU referendum for Leave, this is inevitable. David Cameron, who experienced his disruptive ways first-hand when Cummings worked for Michael Gove at the education department, called him a serial psychopath. Theresa May banished him from Whitehall. Boris Johnson has embraced him, to the unease of many, even in Tory circles.So the revelation that this inquisitive, brooding, menacing figure, plus a sidekick named Ben Warren, had been attending meetings of the Scientific Advisory Group on Emergencies (Sage) was bound to cause a stir. The argument runs that he may have had a chilling effect on free discussion, and that full members of Sage - Cummings was only an attendee - found it worrying that he was parked in on their proceedings. The allegation is that Cummings's interventions sometimes inappropriately influenced what is supposed to be impartial independent advice.In Cummings's defence, he and the PM may have been hugely better informed about the pandemic as a result. Indeed the eventual imposition of a partial lock down last month - which has thus far worked - is said to have been down to a ""Domescene"" moment of realisation when the Sage discussed Imperial College's terrifying estimates of potential casualty levels.Does anyone care? Certainly the issue is what Westminster calls ""process"" rather than substance. While it is true that advisers such as Cummings have rarely if ever attended such specialists committees, that does not necessarily make it a bad thing. Moreover, prime ministerial aides do not have to sit on any particular body to exert influence, benign or otherwise. For example, various enquiries into the lead-up to the Iraq war of 2003 demonstrated how figures such Alastair Campbell and Jonathan Powell interacted with the intelligence apparatus, because of their close relationship with Tony Blair.Would it be better or worse if Cummings had little or no role in the process of decision-making? Is that even realistic? Prime ministers going back to David Lloyd George have always had their own experts, mavericks, cronies, weirdos populating kitchen cabinets, and all interfering with the formal processes of cabinet government, provoking periodic rows and resignations.The matter has, though, acquired an additional cloak and dagger aspect because in the spurious attempt to keep the membership of Sage quiet; it is not secret, but it is unpublished. The members such as Chris Whitty, chief medical officer, don't care who knows they serve on it, but it is not their job to reveal the names. By contrast we know who is on the Cobra group they advise. We also know who is on Nervetag (the New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group) that reports to Sage; but the membership of two other Sage sub-groups is not public. We don't know who sits on SPI-B, the behavioural science group (Independent Scientific Pandemic Influenza Group on Behaviours). Nor is it known who is on the SPI-M, the Scientific Pandemic Influenza Group on Modelling. The policy of naming the shifting membership of these groups is inconsistent, and invites suspicion.In truth, this alphabet soup of geeks and boffins is probably of little interest to the public - so long as they are getting things right, or leastways more right than wrong. Thus far, and despite some unforgivable failures, the worst case scenarios for Covid-19 have not materialised. The hospitals did not run out of intensive care beds nor ventilators nor became overwhelmed. A peak of infections and deaths has been passed. For now, who sits on what committee feels like a secondary issue.",Newspaper

467,"There's no such thing as just 'following the science' - coronavirus advice is political;As we're seeing in this pandemic, politicians tend to favour the evidence that supports their argument Coronavirus - latest updatesSee all our coronavirus coverage","April 28, 2020 Tuesday",International,The Guardian (London),1101,1101,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,Jana Bacevic,"There's no such thing as just 'following the science' - coronavirus advice is politicalAs we're seeing in this pandemic, politicians tend to favour the evidence that supports their argument Coronavirus - latest updatesSee all our coronavirus coverage","At this stage in the coronavirus crisis, the government seems to have made error after error. The UK was slow to enforce a lockdown that seemed inevitable, shortages of personal protective equipment contributed to unnecessary deaths and it seems doubtful the government will meet its self-imposed target of 100,000 tests per day by the end of this week. While other European leaders have laid out roadmaps for how they plan to lift the lockdown,            explaining the science informing their respective approaches, the UK's own exit strategy remains unclear. Until the identities of 23 members of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage)            were revealed by the Guardian, they were shrouded in secrecy.There is no such thing as the 'best science available'. Scientists regularly disagreeYet at every turn, the government has told us that it is ""following the science"". Its strategy, we are told, is informed by the "" best science available "". Though scientific evidence can be a sound justification for government action (or inaction), the relationship between science, politics and society is far more complex than the government would have us believe.To begin with, there is no such thing as the ""best science available"". Scientists regularly disagree about different issues, from theoretical approaches to methodologies and findings, and decisions about what kind of scientific advice is taken into account are highly political. The individuals, disciplines and institutions that are invited to the table reflect the distribution of research funds, prestige and influence, as well as the values and objectives of politicians and policymakers. When it came to austerity, for example, the former coalition government ignored the warnings of many macroeconomists in favour of evidence that supported its worldview. If there is no ""magic money tree"", there is certainly no magic ""best science"" tree either.The purpose of scientific advisory committees such as Sage is to distil existing scientific research so it can inform policy. But the remit of such advice is limited by the questions that politicians ask in the first place. In emergency situations, these questions sound less like ""What is the best science on [X]?"" and more like ""What kind of intervention is likely to prevent [Y]?"" What policymakers choose to prioritise at these moments is a matter of political judgment. Is it the lives of the elderly and the ill? Is it the economy? Or is it political approval ratings? These decisions matter. It also matters what questions politicians don't ask, such as whether coronavirus will disproportionately affect people from black and ethnic minority communities, or whether the effects of lockdown will be worse for            women.Politicians tend to favour the kind of science that aligns with their existing preferences. In the worst case, this can lead to cherrypicking data, pejoratively called ""policy-based evidence"". But it needn't be that extreme. For instance, studies suggesting a very high transmission rate for Covid-19 have been coming out of China since January, and Neil Ferguson, whose team was behind the study cited as precipitating Britain's change of course in managing the pandemic, first sent his report to a Cobra meeting            on 24 January. In February, studies suggesting that a substantial proportion of Covid-19 cases may be asymptomatic appeared in scientific journals. Evidence supporting general social distancing was already there. It took a political change of direction for this kind of data to be presented as "" the science"".This tells us something important about the social nature of scientific knowledge. Scientific models are estimates, not oracles. Scientists can tell politicians the conditions under which their models are likely to work, but they are not responsible for creating those conditions. Blaming epidemiologists for the consequences of the government's Covid-19 strategy is like blaming climate scientists for not preventing the climate crisis. Scientists can provide evidence, but acting on that evidence requires political will.When it comes to policymaking, economic and political considerations tend to take precedence. Britain's delay in enforcing a lockdown was at least in part due to the desire to postpone, if not avoid, an economic recession. The government's decision to keep schools open was motivated by its desire to allow people to keep working. The refusal to join the EU PPE procurement scheme was probably intended to favour local suppliers, as well as to avoid being seen as not ""delivering"" Brexit.The one kind of ""science"" whose role in the government's response isn't clear is the science of surveying and shaping public opinion. The evidence list of SPI-B, the Sage subcommittee on behavioural and social interventions, lists 16 polls and surveys conducted between January and March, tracking risk awareness, perception, and public approval for different kinds of governmental interventions. Of course, it is possible to argue public approval is necessary for measures to be effective: if people disagree with certain measures they are more likely to evade them. But this ignores one important aspect about the relationship between science, politics and public opinion:  people's opinions about science are shaped by how facts are presented in official guidelines and in the media.In this sense, public health advice - which, throughout most of March, focused on handwashing and isolation of symptomatic cases - might have led to a self-fulfilling prophecy: if people believed the official guidelines, it is not surprising they would have been reluctant to support stricter lockdown and social distancing. It was only after a number of independent experts, including the editor of the Lancet           , Richard Horton, started openly questioning the government's strategy, that public opinion overwhelmingly shifted in favour of a lockdown.As long as both the results of these surveys and the Sage and Cobra minutes remain confidential, there is no way to tell exactly how the perception of public approval for different kinds of measures shaped the government's strategy. But focusing attention only on one element in this chain - ""the science"" - eschews questions of political responsibility. How science is turned into policy depends upon political and economic calculations, as well as on the moral and ideological commitments of politicians, political parties and policy advisers. It's rarely, if ever, just about the ""science"". Jana Bacevic is a sociologist at the University of Cambridge ",Newspaper
468,"Coronavirus tracing app developed by NHS could be ready in next fortnight;However, the app will not be ready before next week's review of the lockdown","April 28, 2020 Tuesday",International,The Independent (United Kingdom),544,544,England & Wales,Kate Devlin,"Coronavirus tracing app developed by NHS could be ready in next fortnightHowever, the app will not be ready before next week's review of the lockdown","A coronavirus app being developed by the NHS could be ready in a fortnight, its creators have said. Matthew Gould, CEO of the NHSX digital arm, said the contact tracing technology would be ready in ""two to three weeks"". The app, backed by Matt Hancock, the health secretary, is a key plank of ministers' plans to prevent a second peak in coronavirus cases. However, it will not be finished before 7 May, when ministers are legally bound to review the lockdown.Once downloaded, the app will detect when two smartphones are within 2m of each other, and for how long. Users would receive an amber warning if the corresponding user shows symptoms or a red warning if they test positive. Other countries such as Singapore and Iceland have already developed similar apps. Giving evidence to MPs on the Commons Science and Technology Committee, Mr Gould played down the idea that the app would initially be rolled out nationwide. Instead, it was likely to be tested in a number of ""small"" geographical areas, he said. He told MPs: ""I would expect it technically to be ready for wider deployment in two to three weeks. Whether it is then deployed depends on the wider strategy.""That strategy includes other restrictions imposed by the government, he said, including whether or not social distancing measures were still in place. He also predicted that, in order for the app to gain enough users to be successful, ministers would have to send a tough message to the public. Experts believe between 60 and 80 per cent of smartphone users would have to download the app to successfully slow the spread of the disease. Even then, users would have to obey strict rules and self-isolate if they received a message that they had been in contact with someone who was infected. Mr Gould admitted that it would be ""tough"" to get 80 per cent of smartphone users to install the contact-tracing app. Urging individuals to use the technology had to be part of the government's ""core message"" around Covid-19, he said. He said: ""The message needs to be: if you want to keep your family and yourselves safe, if you want to protect the NHS and stop it being overwhelmed and at the same time get the country back and get the economy moving, the app is going to be an essential part of the strategy for doing that.""The move prompted concerns from senior MPs over privacy and human rights concerns.Harriet Harman, chair of the joint committee on human rights, wrote to Mr Hancock to call for time limits and transparency on use of people's personal data.She said MP were supportive of efforts to banish the virus but said it was vital that ""such measures only interfere with human rights to the extent necessary"".Earlier, Professor Susan Michie, from University College London, who sits on a subcommittee of the Sage group, which advises the government, dismissed the idea that those who have already had coronavirus would be able to secure an immunity ""passport"". Her criticism was shared by Danny Altmann, professor of immunology at Imperial College London, who warned that scientists won't know for up to a year how long immunity to Covid-19 lasts. He told MPs that scientists ""haven't the foggiest notion"" of what a positive test for a past case of Covid-19 would mean for future immunity. ",Newspaper; Web Publication

The announcement on Thursday 16 April comes hours after Mr Raab chaired a Cobra meeting to discuss the current social restrictions in place.The extension has been put in place for ""at least"" three weeks which will take the UK to May 7, when we can expect a second review.Mr Raab, who deputised for Boris Johnson, said the Government was being ""as open as we responsibly can at this stage"". ""It would not be responsible to prejudge the evidence that Sage will have and review in just a few weeks' time.""The Foreign Secretary said the Government carefully followed what is happening in other countries but ""we've got to do what is right for the British people based on the advice of our experts, grounded in the conditions prevailing here in the UK"".He said that measures put in place had been successful but that SAGE said that some settings were still seeing infections spreading.He warned that relaxing social restrictions now would damage economy in the longterm.•: How other countries are ending lockdown                     Is lockdown working?                     Less than 12 hours after the Prime Minister's historic address to the nation on March 23, the London Underground was jammed with commuters (see video below), while builders were seen eating together in communal canteens, making a mockery of the Government's rule that no more than two people can gather together in public.Professor Susan Michie, Director of the University College London's Centre for Behaviour Change, warned that some people would simply not be able to carry out the measures, even if they wanted to.""Five million self-employed people are being left potentially destitute by the Government failing to offer financial supportas they have done for directly employed workers,"" she said. ""Since [statutory sick pay of] £94 is not enough to pay rent, bills, food for a family etc, they will be forced to carry on as usual.""The British Transport Police is now on hand to make sure only            critical workers are using the London Underground. But such an inauspicious start to the lockdown suggests the virus will spread further than it would have, had stricter measures been implemented earlier,            as they have in other countries. And it means that the measures we do have are likely to be in place for longer to ""flatten the curve"" in a way that would prevent a second dangerous peak.In addition, on April 1 the Government revealed figures that suggested the lockdown was starting to fray as data showed an ""uptick""            in the number of people using transport.The number of those using their cars and public transport, which had been consistently dropping since strict social distancing measures were introduced, rose for the first time.It is feared that sunny weather will prompt more people to break the rules and go outside to socialise as boredom kicks in.•: Can I go for a drive during lockdown?How long will lockdown last?Mr Raab said the Government needed to be satisfied of five things before it would consider it safe to adjust any of the current measures:•Protect the NHS's ability to cope and be confident that the NHS is able to provide sufficient critical care across the UK.•See a sustained and consistent fall in daily death rates to be confident the UK is beyond the peak.•Reliable data from Sage showing rate of infection is decreasing to manageable levels across the board.•Confident that testing capacity and PPE are in hand with supply able to meet future demand.•Confident that any adjustments to the current measures would not risk a second peak in infections which would overwhelm the NHS.When the lockdown was first announced, Professor Mark Woolhouse, Professor of Infectious Disease Epidemiology, University of Edinburgh, said: ""We now enter a phase of careful monitoring. We are looking for indicators first that the epidemic is slowing down and then for numbers of new cases to start to fall. ""After three weeks we will have to decide whether the restrictions need to be continued, can be relaxed, or can be relaxed temporarily with the expectation of imposing them again later. ""We must also monitor the damage that the lockdown is doing; damage to the economy, to education, to psychological well-being and to health and social care provision in the community. The impacts of this epidemic are too far reaching for policy decisions to be driven by epidemiology alone.""Professor Sheila Bird said that more cases in coming weeks would make it easier for the Government to predict how the epidemic is responding to lockdown measures, which will inform how long they remain in place. ""Once an epidemic takes hold, as now in UK, the country's own data - properly reported and interpreted - take precedence over modelling as the data tell us the actual toll which the epidemic is exacting,"" she said.""A huge amount can be inferred about the immediately forthcoming weeks from these data directly, including whether further policy changes are needed to reinforce social-distancing; for example in particular age groups.""Some experts are still concerned that the current restrictions do not go far enough while others say the government has been hit by an ""epidemic of action"", and is now bringing in measures that have little rationale. Professor Robert Dingwall, Professor of Sociology, at Nottingham Trent University, wrote in The Telegraph: ""It is another triumph of populism over science, of a capitulation to the demand to 'do something'. ""We are still seeing some notion that 'the people' are selfish and must be bullied and disciplined. ""The people are not selfish; they have behaved in ways that are individually rational but have collectively irrational results.""However Dr Andrea Collins, Senior Clinical Lecturer in Respiratory Medicine at the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine (LSTM), said: ""I believe that they have not quite gone far enough. The 'absolutely' necessary to go to work is still being used by some when it is not required-I think we need permits across controlled areas to go to a workplace.""Recent modelling from the universities of Exeter, Bristol and Warwick suggested that without any measures at all, the epidemic would have peaked around 133 days after first person-to-person transmission in Britain, which happened around February 28. So the lockdown has the potential of curtailing the spread by around seven weeks. A welcome relief for people who could have been facing lockdown for most of the summer.",Newspaper; Web Publication

Matt Hancock has ended the day as he started it-by dodging a request for an apology.During this evening's press conference the Health Secretary was asked to say sorry for leaving care home residents and staff unprotected, but said the question was not reasonable. The daily briefing was dominated with questions about care homes, after Mr Hancock confirmed asymptomatic residents and staff would now be able to get a coronavirus test. It caps a challenging day for the minister, who this morning was asked to apologise for failings over PPE by the son of a doctor who died earlier this month.

Downing Street is increasingly looking like an outlier-as it was at the start of the outbreak-only this time it's the question of an exit strategy. The Government's advice on face masks is unchanged, Matt Hancock made clear tonight.But Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has recommended people start wearing them in certain environments, while French PM Edouard Philippe also included face masks as part of his exit plan. France has also gone further than the UK has in terms of setting out its roadmap out of the lockdown, as the PM's spokesman downplayed suggestions that Boris Johnson might do likewise this week.

But she says she doesn't have an answer. Matt Hancock says the Government is still looking at it. There was huge benefit to introducing lockdown as one country, despite London and West Midlands having more cases. It's not just about the level, it's also about the slope of the curve-if it goes above one anywhere it would lead to an exponential rise. The slope has been remarkably similar across the country, which argues for continuing to do things as one country.                     28 Apr 2020-05:47PM BST                                        Care home closures late because of 'positive impact' on residents                   The issue of care homes continues to dominate, with a question about why they were not told to ban visitors until 16 March.""That was based on clinical advice,"" the Health Secretary says.Matt Hancock said:                     ""Before there was a widespread incidence of coronavirus across the community as a whole, the critical thing is that in a care home having visitors also has a positive impact against the loneliness of residents and for their longevity and mental health.""There are no easy recommendations to make...

Sage has put so much effort into looking at this question, the deputy chief scientific adviser adds. Matt Hancock-we are guided by the science, the UK Government position hasnt changed not least because the most important thing we can do is social distancing""That is our absolute priority,"" says Mr Hancock. ""Social distancing is the number one thing saving lives"". 28 Apr 2020-05:31PM BSTMany care home residents asymptomatic: Testing tzarTesting tzar John Newton says testing within care homes is a focus. He says the presence of symptoms wasn't a good marker-there were many residents who didn't have symptoms who did have the virus. The testing regime announced by Matt Hancock will really make a difference, Mr Newton adds. Asked about the proportion of deaths, Mr Hancock says the number is changing, and stresses care homes are an absolute focus. Mr Hancock bristles at a question implying that the Government has not done enough to protect the sector, insisting that support including testing was there from the start. The journalist asks: ""Testing in care homes was inadequate. PPE was inadequate. This seems to have taken you be surprise. Will you apologise for leaving people unprotected?""Hancock says he does not think that is reasonable as a question.He adds that the Government knew care home residents would be particularly at risk and ensuring they had the support they need was ""absolutely front of minds"" as early as January. The first thing we knew about this virus was that it was very dangerous for older people, he says. Mr Newton echoes the Health Secretary's comments, saying it would be wrong to suggest testing hasn't happened, but it will get better thanks to improved capacity.28 Apr 2020-05:26PM BSTHancock: PPE system getting strongerTurning to journalists questions, Matt Hancock is asked about PPE, which he says the Government is ""moving heaven and earth"" to do. The system is getting stronger, he adds.Asked about the BBC's own report, he says he is ""not sure they were a fair and objective journalistic assessment"".We are constantly needing to buy more from abroad and make more at home, he says. 28 Apr 2020-05:24PM BSTHancock: Most vulnerable must remain shieldedThe mother of a boy with cystic fibrosis and autism asks what provision is being made for vulnerable children. Matt Hancock says medical needs have to come first, so for those who are being shielded that remains the safest thing to do.But the education plan makes allowance for children with special health needsThe Government is working on measures to support vulnerable children where possible, and ""incredibly hard"" on a vaccine. 28 Apr 2020-05:22PM BSTHancock: No decision on childcare while daily deaths stay highAmanda from Hull asks what the Government is planning to do for childcare when it comes to lifting the lockdown. Matt Hancock says it is still too early to say when schools will go back because there are still too many deaths each day and the five tests haven't been met. As a parent of three children he says he understands the ""yearning"", but he can't give her an answer because the rate of infections isn't yet safe to reopen schools. ""We haven't been able to make that decision yet"". 28 Apr 2020-05:18PM BSTDaily death rates falling for a fortnight: McLeanDeputy chief scientific adviser Angela McLean is going through the slidesNew positive tests in hospitals are in blue, while additional testing for key workers is in orange, she says. The blue line has now stabilised and is starting to fall, but because the number of tests is rising overall we are stil getting the same number in the UK. The number of people in hospital has fallen by 14 per cent in the last week, a particularly dramatic fall in London, says Prof McLean. Occupancy of critical care beds is also beginning to fall as a percentage. In terms of daily deaths in hospital, that number has been falling for two weeks. The slide with UK deaths in hospitals shows the country tracking France, Italy and Spain. But once you include all settings that line is much higher. 28 Apr 2020-05:10PM BSTHancock: Tests rolled out to all over-65 and anyone who works outside their homeWe will not be changing lockdown measures until all five tests are met, Matt Hancock stresses. He turns to testing, with the Government ""ramping up"" its effort to meet his 100,000 target by Thursday's deadline. There are now 41 drive through centres and home testing has been expanded, from 5,000 last Friday to 25,000 by the end of the week. Mobile units will increase to more than 70.Capacity has risen to 73,400, he says, while 43,453 were carried out yesterday. Testing of asymptomatic residents and staff in care homes in England, and patients and staff in the NHS, will begin so anyone can have access to a test regardless of whether they have symptoms or not. Testing will also be available to all over-65s and their families with symptoms and any workers who have to leave home to go to work, including construction and manufacturing.28 Apr 2020-05:07PM BSTHancock: Daily death figures will include care homesMatt Hancock kicks off the press conference praising the ""nation's fallen heroes""-NHS staff and care workers-who were honoured this morning during the minute's silence. ""Every day we are working through our plan to protect life and protect the NHS,"" he says.Mr Hancock confirms that 21,678 people have now died in hospital, and increase of 586 on the previous day. From tomorrow, the Government figures will include care settings, he confirms 28 Apr 2020-04:59PM BSTMore countries reveal exit strategiesGreece and Serbia have joined the growing number of countries setting out plans to lift their lockdowns. Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis has just announced a gradual easing of coronavirus lockdown rules from 4 May, but said implementation would be monitored on a daily basis.""Having contained the first wave of the virus, we are now ready to move to the second phase, the gradual de-escalation of (lockdown) measures,"" Mr Mitsotakis said in a televised address.Meanwhile Serbia's restaurants and cafes will reopen next week, with flights resuming in mid-May.""Starting from Monday, restaurants and cafes will reopen with social distance respected and all other safety measures taken,"" Branislav Tiodorovic of the government's team of experts told reporters.Inter-city trains, long-distance buses and city public transport will also restart next week, while shopping centres will open on May 8 and air traffic will resume on 18 May, he said.Daycare for children up to 12 years old will reopen on 11 May so parents can go back to work, Mr Tiodorovic said.French Prime Minister Edouard Philippe set out his plan earlier today (3:15pm). But President Vladimir Putin said Russia had not yet reached the peak of coronavirus infections and would only start looking at the possibility of lifting quarantines from 12 May.28 Apr 2020-04:48PM BSTTwo pints of larger and an exit strategy, pleaseCould pub landlords be asked to ration beer to a couple of pints as part of the Government's exit strategy. Eyal Winter, part of a team of behavioural experts who have been advising the government since April, has told the Guardian he believes Downing Street should follow this path instead of ""nudge"" warnings aimed at keeping people out of pubs and bars. Mr Winter also told the paper that the Government should follow a German-style approach, with clear dates and targets.""One of the most important things is to have a programme, to say, 'in two weeks we will do such and such',"" he said. ""You need to make the rules crystal clear, and to explain to the public the rationale behind each one of them.""28 Apr 2020-04:30PM BSTNumber crunching: Did sporting events spread coronavirus?Questions are increasingly being asked about whether the Government was wrong to allow certain sporting events to take place after coronavirus was spreading within the UK. We heard Matt Hancock give his response to a concerned resident of Cheltenham earlier today (see 8:19am) and on previous days we have seen advisers acknowledge that it was an ""interesting hypothesis"" that the Champions League game between Liverpool and Atletico Madrid could have spread the disease further. My data viz colleagues have been crunching the numbers to see if they stack up.28 Apr 2020-04:17PM BSTVirtual history as MP gives first remote maiden speechA female MP has just become the first to make a maiden speech outside the Commons.Deputy Speaker Nigel Evans declared it was ""history in the making"" as Sara Britcliffe, the Conservative MP for Hyndburn, spoke from her constituency in Lancashire on videoconferencing software. She told the chamber: ""I always said I got into politics to serve the community that I love and have lived in all of my life.""And I always said I'd somehow redefine what it meant to be a constituency MP, so along with making history as the first female MP for the area, and the youngest Conservative MP in the country, I'm the first Member of Parliament ever to make their maiden speech remotely from their own home.""I do this as I wanted to stay here, rooted into my community, to rise to the challenges we face because, I've always said, we're stronger together.""Ms Britcliffe said her main aim is to boost funding for the north, telling MPs it cannot just be a ""one-off response"" to an election result. She promised to be a ""bloody difficult woman"", quoting Ken Clarke's words about Theresa May. 28 Apr 2020-04:02PM BSTExclusive: Priti Patel cleared of claims that she bullied staff after investigation by Cabinet secretaryHere's a fresh breaking story from one of my lobby colleagues: Priti Patel has been cleared of bullying members of her staff after an official investigation.The report into the Home Secretary was presented to Prime Minister Boris Johnson after he returned to work on Monday and is expected to be made public tomorrow. Charles Hymas has got the story here. 28 Apr 2020-03:33PM BSTPictures of Chris Whitty and youWe are not expecting to see chief medical officer Chris Whitty at today's Downing Street briefing-so instead here are some depictions of the Prof that have been drawn, painted or even sculpted in deference to the senior adviser. I hope it's not unkind to suggest some are better than others.  Here's some more  Even comedian Joe Lycett has had a go... 28 Apr 2020-03:25PM BSTMore detail on French exit strategyThe detail coming out of Paris makes for interesting reading, considering the UK's own shuffle towards relaxing restrictions. Among the measures announced by Prime Minister Edouard Philippe just now is the plan to carry out 700,000 coronavirus tests a week-equal to Downing Street's own aim of 100,000 a day (which we are still far off reaching-see 1:27pm)Those who test positive must be isolated for 14 days either at home or in special accommodation. Everyone who has been able to work from home should continue to do so, Mr Philippe said. And there is bad news for small businesses who might be looking for a positive precedent-bars, restaurants and cinemas remain closed.Small museums will reopen on 11 May, but larger ones will stay shut. Nurseries will reopen, but with a maximum of 10 children in each groupMasks will be made compulsory in some sectors, for example on the metro and in colleges, although junior school children will not have to wear them. That will put further pressure on the Government to follow suit, after Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon changed the advice coming out of Holyrood. 28 Apr 2020-03:15PM BSTFrench football ban continues as Paris begins to lift lockdownFrench Prime Minister Edouard Philippe has just set out the new rules for lifting the country's lockdowns, which includes masks for school children and a continued ban of sporting events. From 11 May French citizens will no longer require a form to go out, unless people are travelling more than 100km. Over-65s were told to remain ""cautious"". Football games will not be allowed to take place until this autumn, Mr Philippe has said just now. Gatherings of more than 10 people will continue to be banned. French beaches will continue to be shut until JuneMatt Hancock suggested this m
rning (8:22am) that the Premier League could open soon, although he shied away from putting a date on it. 28 Apr 2020-02:55PM BSTWatch: Nicola Sturgeon changes face mask adviceIf you missed First Minister Nicola Sturgeon's briefing earlier today, you can see it again on the video below. The PM's spokesman appeared to be caught off guard by the change of advice (at least, he said he hadn't seen it). Will Matt Hancock have a response in this evening's press briefing? We've been told to expect two questions from members of the public after yesterday's launch-have you submitted yours yet?28 Apr 2020-02:49PM BSTNumber crunching: Is the UK flattening the curve?It's arguably the most important question at the minute, and will play a huge factor in the Government's decision when to lift the lockdown. Where are we on the peak? We've been told we are at the peak. We've been told we are passing through the peak. We've been told there is light at the end of the tunnel But what does that actually mean?As always, my data viz colleagues are on hand to crunch the numbers.28 Apr 2020-02:42PM BSTLockdown has given abusers 'greater control;Theresa May says coronavirus lockdown has given perpetrators of domestic abuse ""greater control"" because they can take their victims' mobiles away and stop them from walking out the door. Ms May urges the Government to remind people they can leave their homes to avoid harm, and seek the support they need.But it is much harder for them to leave, to report abuse, she says. The former Prime Minister suggests deploying a similar approach to the NYPD, including the random contact of homes where there are known perpetrators. And she urges Government to consider the impact of relaxing lockdown not just on the NHS but also on overall health and wellbeing as a nation, including domestic abuse and mental health. 28 Apr 2020-02:37PM BSTGovernment's daily death toll figures late (again)The Government's daily death toll figures are running late again. The UK-wide figures are currently just for deaths of hospital patients who have tested positive for coronavirus.ONS figures show that this number is coming down as a proportion of the total-accounting for just over three quarters of Covid-19 deaths as of last week. It's likely the Health Secretary will be asked about this during the press conference today, as ministers have said they want to get to a point where they can include care home deaths.UPDATE on            #COVIDー19 testing in the UK:Today's figures will be published later this afternoon.We are working hard to provide you with the latest information and will tweet this out as soon as possible- Department of Health and Social Care (@DHSCgovuk)            April 28, 2020 Either way, the Government figures are still essential for understanding where we are in the peak.28 Apr 2020-02:29PM BSTLockdown has 'produced the conditions' for increase in domestic abuseThe Domestic Abuse Bill is being debated in the Commons and some grim figures have just been given by Nick Thomas-Symonds, who notes that coronavirus is giving rise to a worrying increase in child abuse. ""The lockdown has changed patterns of crime,"" the Shadow Home Secretary says. He notes that the National Crime Agency said this weekend they had informed police of 1,300 potential child sexual abuse this weekend by the National Crime Agency. The NCA also arrested a British man with indecent images of children trying to return to the UK from Indonesia. That paints a worrying picture, he says. The lockdown has also produced the conditions under which domestic abuse has sharply increased. There have also been 100 arrests a day for domestic abuse on average since the lockdown, he says. The warning signals of abuse are flashing red.28 Apr 2020-02:21PM BSTNHS England: Further 552 people have died in hospitalsThe number of people who have died in English hospitals has bounced back up, with NHS England reporting a rise of 552 today. That brings the total number of confirmed reported deaths in hospitals in England to 19,301. It is also a sharp rise on the previous day, when 329 people had died.Patients were aged between 31 and 99 years old, with 38 of the patients having no known underlying health condition. The regional breakdown suggests a significant decline in numbers in London, where 88 deaths were recorded. Last week that number was closer to 130. Meanwhile another 17 people have died after testing positive for Covid-19 in Wales, Public Health Wales said, taking the death toll there to 813.28 Apr 2020-02:14PM BSTHague: Ministers should avoid one-size-fits-all exit strategyFormer Conservative leader William Hague admits he does not envy ministers ""as they try to pick their way through these and other dilemmas, but I would urge them to shy away from solutions based on blanket, one-size-fits-all policies dictating the hourly habits of millions of people"".As ministers ponder how to relax the lockdown in the coming weeks,            they would do well to avoid telling the over-70s to stay in their homes for the rest of the year, he writes. 28 Apr 2020-02:09PM BSTNo Cornish holidays 'for some time to come': GoveBrits will not be able to visit seaside resorts such as Cornwall ""for some time to come"", Michael Gove has said. Asked if he could reassure holiday businesses in that part of the world, Mr Gove replied: ""My honourable friend is right, Cornwall is beautiful, visiting it is a pleasure, but at the moment and for some time to come, don't.""Despite the fact that some parts of the UK are seeing much fewer coronavirus cases, the Cabinet Office minister said lockdown restrictions would be lifted in ""as united a way as possible"" across the UK.""The chief medical officers of all four parts of the UK meet regularly and scientific advice is shared across the UK and we want to ensure that as we ease any restrictions, that we do so in as united a way as possible, because consistency of messaging is critical to ensuring that all of us can see some of our cherished liberties restored, while at the same time protecting precious lives.""28 Apr 2020-02:01PM BSTGove insists Government took scientific advice on PPE stockpileMichael Gove has been answering questions in the Commons about how public services have been faring in light of the pandemic. Asked about social care, Mr Gove said the ONS figures released this morning were ""deeply concerning"", and reiterates the Government's efforts to work with CQC to speed the data up.That BBC investigation has cast a long shadow, but the chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster has insisted the PPE stockpile prior to the outbreak was ""explicitly designed in accordance with the advice from the scientific advisers the Government has"", while stressing it was ""specifically for a flu pandemic""-and therefore the requirements were different.Mr Gove told MPs: ""The nature of coronavirus is different from a flu pandemic as we all know and we, like every government across the world, have had to respond to this new virus by assuring not just with personal protective equipment, but in every respect, that we are in a position to retool, refit and to upgrade our response.""28 Apr 2020-01:56PM BSTWhy UK's death toll could soon be the worst in EuropeUK has recorded Europe's highest average daily deaths for four days in a row-pushing it towards becoming Europe's worst affected country. While we wait for today's latest figures, have a look at            this sobering article by my colleague Ashley Kirk. 28 Apr 2020-01:27PM BSTDemand for home tests begins to settleDemand for home tests is definitely settling. Whereas they ran out of 5,000 kits in just two minutes on the first day, it took just over an hour yesterday. Today in the same time period, 7,000 went in first hour, out of a total of 10,000. In terms of the drive through tests, 22,000 of the 26,000 slots have been booked. And for tests overall, 37,024 tests were carried out in the 24 hours to 9am yesterday, with capacity over 52,000.28 Apr 2020-01:10PM BSTDowning Street plays down reports of lockdown light this weekDowning Street was playing down any expectation that we might see a change to the lockdown rules this week, despite widespread reports suggesting that was the case. Despite Boris Johnson pledging to set out his plans to ""fire up the economy"" in the next few days, his spokesman insisted Government is still working towards the deadline for the review on 7 May. It sounds as though rather than giving us the granular details of which businesses will be able to open first, this week will see more information about how authorities will keep on top of things, and continue to prevent a second peak, when restrictions are relaxed.28 Apr 2020-01:06PM BSTMight Boris Johnson miss PMQs?It was a quite frustrating lobby session just now, with quite a lot of evasion. One particular area where we didn't get any straight answers was on whether Boris Johnson will take part in PMQs tomorrow. The spokesman said the Prime Minister was ""fine"", having chaired this morning's coronavirus war cabinet. He met with the chancellor and cabinet secretary this morning, which was paused for the minute's silence. For the rest of the day he will be having meetings, going through his papers, and carrying out box work as part of the coronavirus response. This evening's press conference will be taken by Matt Hancock yet again.28 Apr 2020-01:01PM BSTPM's spokesman hints at face masks advice shiftGood afternoon. I'm just back from lobby where there was a discussion about face masks in light of the new advice from Scotland. The PM's spokesman said ministers were still considering the Sage advice (which was submitted after the scientists met last Tuesday). Asked if it was unhelpful for Scotland to change their advice, the spokesman implied the UK advice would also change soon.He said: ""There have been points in response so far where announcements had been made ever so slightly different times, but by and large we have moved forward with single four nations approach."" It doesn't sound as though that will come today-but perhaps this week.28 Apr 2020-12:50PM BST3,203 fines for breaking social distancing rulesMichael Gove tells the Commons that a total of 3,203 fines were handed out to people who flouted social distancing rules between March 27 and April 13.The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster said: ""Our police have been working hard to keep people safe, while enforcing the new measures the Prime Minister put in place just over a month ago.""They've issued 3,203 fines between March 27 and April 13 to those who have flouted social distancing rules and this number will of course have increased considerably since then, all dedicated to helping save lives and protecting the NHS.""28 Apr 2020-12:46PM BSTMistakes? We've made a fewThe Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster Michael Gove admits the Government has made mistakes in its response to the coronavirus pandemic.He tells the Commons: ""I won't shirk from acknowledging, that we won't, as a Government, have got every judgement right.""28 Apr 2020-12:42PM BSTScottish government recommends wearing a face covering in shops and on public transportThe Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon claims that there ""may be some benefit"" to wearing a face covering on public transport or in shops to reduce the chance of people spreading disease.Ms Sturgeon said: ""The Scottish Government is now recommending the use of face coverings in these limited circumstances as a precautionary measure.""Given that the evidence is relatively weak we're not at this stage making this mandatory or suggesting that it will be enforced. We will be keeping that under review.""Will Westminster follow suit?28 Apr 2020-12:28PM BSTCouncils plan the re-opening of waste collection sitesCouncils are being asked to plan the organised re-opening of household waste collection sites, Secretary of State for Housing, Communities and Local Government Robert Jenrick has announced.Speaking in the Commons during his department's questions, he said: ""Our bin men and women have done a fantastic job maintaining the vast majority of collections.""The Government published advice to councils on how to ensure the safety of refuse collections on April 7 and today I am announcing that I'm asking councils to plan the organised re-opening of household waste collection sites.

471,Ministers try to buy time on tests target;Scientists cast doubt on ministers' hopes for immunity passports,"April 28, 2020 Tuesday",International,The Daily Telegraph (London),716,716,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,Anna Mikhailova,Ministers try to buy time on tests targetScientists cast doubt on ministers' hopes for immunity passports,"THE Government is seeking to buy more time to hit its testing target by saying the complete data may not be ready until next week.The Prime Minister's spokesman said yesterday it would be ""difficult"" to know if the 100,000-tests-a-day target had been hit by the Thursday deadline.As part of an attempt to ramp up testing, yesterday one London NHS trust said all patients admitted to hospital would now be swabbed for the virus, including those admitted through A&E. The latest daily testing figures showed 37,024 tests carried out on Sunday, up from 29,058 tests done in the 24 hours to 9am on Saturday.Downing Street said the Saturday testing number was ""under the old regime"" and did not include home testing kits sent through an online portal set up for essential workers on Friday, or mobile testing units. It said the numbers had a ""significant time lag"", usually seen after the weekend, and played down expectations that the data would show whether the Government had hit its target this Thursday.Liz Kendall, the shadow health and social care minister, told The Daily Telegraph: ""The promise was 100,000 actual tests done a day - not the capacity Continued on Page 2 Continued from Page 1 were carried out by the end of April.Sir Patrick revealed fierce debate between scientists about policies to tackle the spread of the virus.In a briefing yesterday, he said: ""The weaker the evidence and the more controversial it is the more heated and prolonged the discussions are, and the more opinion becomes the dominant feature. The challenge is not to allow the dominant voices to become the ones that necessarily win the argument on that,"" he said, ""because it has to be one that's based on evidence as far as we can."" He described recent discussions about the scientific evidence to support face mask wearing by the general public as a ""classic example"" of such debate.""We had several meetings to discuss the evidence; the evidence is quite difficult to interpret because it's not very strong. We've given advice through to ministers for them to make policy decisions on the back of it, and ... we've also been really clear where the uncertainty lies,"" he said, saying it was down to ministers to make a judgment.Sir Patrick said it was ""absolutely clear"" that ""high-grade"" medical face masks were crucial in healthcare settings, and must not be compromised by any decision to suggest the public could benefit from facial coverings.He said: ""There are certain types of face masks that actually are much simpler to procure to use which could be beneficial but we've given our thoughts on that, then ministers will make decisions on what they would like to do."" He also said there was uncertainty among scientists about how far people become immune following infection.Last week, the World Health Organisation said there was currently ""no evidence that people who have recovered from Covid-19 and have antibodies are protected from a second infection"". But Sir Patrick suggested there was broad agreement within Sage that some immunity was likely to be conferred - though not enough to be confident that immunity passports could be issued, as ministers have suggested. ""There is quite a strong consensus that most people get antibodies, and those antibodies are likely to be protective in some form, although we can't be sure to the exact degree,"" he said.He suggested that the debate swung from ""thinking nobody gets immune"" to ""thinking that you've got something as clear and straightforward as an immunity passport that everyone could just go around waving"" when the truth was likely to fall between the two.Yesterday, Prof Susan Michie, a Sage subcommittee member, suggested that blanket stay-at-home advice to over-70s could not be maintained when the lockdown restrictions were eased. Prof Michie, a University College London health psychology expert, called for ""more reformed and nuanced"" guidance to take account of differences within age groups.She said: ""There are many 70 and 80-year-olds that are much fitter and healthier than those who are a lot younger.""I think the problem is that if people don't perceive the guidance to be proportionate to their own situation there will be problems with adherence, and we now know more about who is at risk and the whole progress of the disease.""",Newspaper
472,Revealed: the inside story of the UK's Covid-19 crisis;How herd immunity and delayed lockdown hampered efforts to contain the spread of coronavirus Coronavirus - latest updatesSee all our coronavirus coverage,"April 29, 2020 Wednesday",International,The Guardian (London),5240,5240,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,"David Conn, Felicity Lawrence, Paul Lewis, Severin Carrell, David Pegg, Harry Davies and Rob Evans",Revealed: the inside story of the UK's Covid-19 crisisHow herd immunity and delayed lockdown hampered efforts to contain the spread of coronavirus Coronavirus - latest updatesSee all our coronavirus coverage,"In common with the many thousands of people whose lives have suddenly been devastated by Covid-19, Ken Sazuze cannot know exactly when the coronavirus landed on his family and wreaked its terrible damage. His wife, Elsie, was 44, a much-loved nurse, mother to their children, Anna, 16, and Andrew, 22; she was his soulmate and best friend, a ""genuine person,"" he says. Elsie died on 8 April, on a ventilator, in Birmingham's Good Hope hospital.Ken believes she became infected sometime in that eerie, frightening week after Monday 16 March, when Boris Johnson's government reconsidered its previous light-touch approach, which had envisaged 60% of the population - 40 million people - would become infected, and while many would die, the majority would recover and attain ""herd immunity"". That week, although more physical distancing had been advised by Johnson, normal life mostly continued until the compulsory lockdown; pubs, restaurants and gyms stayed open, as did schools, until Friday 20 March. Sazuze, who served 10 years in the British army before studying to be a nurse himself, says he ""never liked that herd immunity idea"".""During those weeks, the virus was allowed to spread,"" he says. ""We have suffered such a painful blow. I strongly believe that if the government had acted more quickly we wouldn't have lost so many lives, and my wife could be here today.""The health secretary, Matt Hancock, supported by Downing Street, has persistently denied that attaining herd immunity, by allowing the disease to infect most people, was ever a policy, goal, strategy or even ""part of the plan"". Well-placed government sources said on the strictest reading of the word ""policy"" that may be true. But they do not understand how the government can claim that herd immunity was not part of its plan.The Guardian's account of the government's response to the crisis is based on interviews with sources in or close to Downing Street, the Department of Health and Social Care, the Cabinet Office, Cobra and Sage, as well as other advisers and experts. Many asked not to be named, because they were not authorised to speak publicly. Some said that while they had concerns, they were holding back some of their criticism because they did not want to damage public trust in government at such a delicate time. All are wary of being wise in hindsight, and sympathetic to ministers who took decisions they felt were right at the time.But with Covid-19 having spread virulently, particularly during those first three weeks of March, more than 21,000 people have now died in hospitals alone and Britain is predicted to be possibly the worst affected country in Europe. There are profound questions to be answered, about why Johnson's government stood alone among the countries of the world, pursuing that herd immunity approach, and why, when they realised stricter measures were needed, the lockdown was still delayed.Prof Neil Ferguson, the lead scientist on the Covid-19 response team at Imperial College London, whose advice paper of 16 March is credited with convincing the government to change course, responded extensively to questions from the Guardian for this article. He emphasised that one alarming estimate in that paper was not new: that under the ""mitigation scenario"", which apparently envisaged herd immunity as one outcome, and included measures then being considered by the government, 250,000 people would die.                                        Brexit                                      Viewed from today's unimaginably changed perspective, this year's pre-crisis months can seem like a parallel world. Johnson's media backers were feting him then for winning the ""Get Brexit Done"" election, and his private life, since criticised by some as a distraction, was portrayed as a cause for national rejoicing when on 29 February he and Carrie Symonds announced their engagement.Johnson took Britain out of the European Union on 31 January, portraying the moment as an opportunity to ""unleash the full potential of this brilliant country and to make better the lives of everyone in every corner of our United Kingdom."" A day earlier, an emergency committee of the World Health Organization declared that Covid-19, which had broken out in China and spread to 18 countries,            was a           public           health           emergency of           international           concern (PHEIC). The WHO stated then, as it has emphasised throughout, that this highest state of alert required an immediate response. In the absence of a vaccine, the WHO insisted that the virus should be addressed like the operation mounted in South Korea, with extensive testing, tracing people with whom a person testing positive has had close contact, and isolating all of them, ""to interrupt virus spread"".David Nabarro, the WHO Covid-19 envoy, told the Guardian that he and the director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, knew then that the coronavirus was going to become ""huge"" and would be ""really difficult"" for governments.""Coronaviruses are horrible,"" Nabarro said. ""They're rather stable and incredibly well designed to wreak havoc among populations because they are very, very easy to transmit and quite tough to contain. You can't just let this thing go, and let it wash over your society, because it will kill lots of old people, and a few younger people, it will make hospitals into a big mess, and it will endanger health workers.""On 3 February, Johnson made another triumphal Brexit speech, in which he even sounded a note against responding too strongly to Covid-19, arguing it ran counter to his vision of Britain as a ""supercharged champion"" of global free trade.He was labelled a ""part-time prime minister"" by the Labour opposition on 28 February, after he spent 12 days away at the Chevening country residence in Kent, and did not attend four of the first five meetings of the Cobra committee, convened to consider Britain's response to Covid-19, until one on Monday 2 March. He did go to a meeting in late February, attended by senior officials, but only very briefly, without making a substantial contribution, which one attendee says seemed strange. Asked about this, a Downing Street spokesperson clarified that Johnson went to be updated on coronavirus, and left after that.The government's decision-making on Covid-19 has since become a focus of fierce scrutiny and much criticism, partly for its lack of transparency. Cobra, the forum for considering emergencies, attended by ministers and their officials, meets in secret. It takes scientific advice from Sage, whose membership was not made public until the Guardian revealed the names of participants. They included Johnson's chief of staff, Dominic Cummings, and another Downing Street adviser, Ben Warner, a data scientist who worked on the Vote Leave Brexit campaign, and is said by one Sage attendee to have ""behaved as Cummings' deputy"".Supposed to be impartial and free from political influence, Sage responds to questions passed down from Cobra. Its own makeup has been criticised by some as too narrow, overly reliant on epidemiologists who specialise in mathematical modelling. One participant told the Guardian that Sage lacked diversity and was ""way too slow"" to consider how other countries, including those in south Asia, were managing to contain the spread of the virus. A spokesperson for Sir Patrick Vallance, the government's chief scientific adviser, rejected those criticisms, saying the scientists are engaged with experts in other countries and ""containment strategies form part of those discussions"".Sage receives advice from three expert groups: Nervtag, which examines the science of the virus itself; SPI-M, which models how it spreads; and SPI-B, which involves behavioural scientists in considering how people may respond to restrictive measures.Following initial criticism, the government has published some details, making public the Nervtag membership and minutes of meetings, and some limited papers from SPI-M and SPI-B. Yet even these few documents do establish that Covid-19's catastrophic threat to life was communicated clearly to ministers by the scientific advisers.On 2 March, a brief ""consensus statement"" from SPI-M reported very stark assessments to Sage. ""It is highly likely that there is sustained transmission of Covid-19 in the UK at present,"" it said. The coronavirus was noted to be highly contagious, with each infected person infecting two to three more. If ""stringent measures"" were not imposed, ""it would correspond to around 80% of the population [53 million people] becoming infected"". SPI-M's best estimate of the death rate was 0.5% to 1%: between 250,000 and 500,000 people. Of those requiring hospital treatment, 12% were likely to die. If, like Elsie Sazuze, they needed to be put on a ventilator, they had only a 50% chance of survival.Yet somehow, the genuine peril and need to act fast was not seized on by the government. The first phase of a plan to contain the virus with testing and tracing was ended on 12 March, and the policy moved to try to delay the peak of the infection. Later, the plan was for ""mitigation"", for a series of measures to be gradually brought in: ""case isolation"" of seven days for somebody who felt they had symptoms, then ""household isolation"" for everybody living with them to quarantine themselves for 14 days, then at some point, to shield elderly and vulnerable people.The day after the 2 March Cobra meeting and SPI-M statement, Johnson held the first televised press conference with Vallance and Chris Whitty, the chief medical officer. Whitty did say solemnly that a worst-case scenario estimated 80% of people could become infected, and 1% of those could die, but the message best remembered is Johnson joshingly telling the nation: ""I was at a hospital the other night where I think there were actually a few coronavirus patients and I shook hands with everybody.""Johnson's advice was: ""We should all basically just go about our normal daily lives."" He also advised: ""The best thing you can do is to wash your hands with soap and hot water while singing Happy Birthday twice.""Over the next fortnight, as Italy moved to impose a lockdown, France and Spain began to do the same, and Germany embarked on physical distancing measures coupled with Europe's most extensive testing and contact tracing operation, Britain did comparatively little. Hand-washing was still the main advice, along with case isolation of people feeling symptoms.The first official report of somebody dying in hospital having tested positive for Covid-19 caught in the UK came on 5 March. Still, elderly and vulnerable people were not given any advice to shield themselves. A member of one Sage advisory committee said that around this time there was a gap between the scientific advice and political messaging. ""The prime minister was going around shaking people's hands to demonstrate that there wasn't a problem. There was a disconnect at that point. We were all slightly incredulous that that was happening.""Some experts believe Britain's exceptional response arose in part because government preparations for a pandemic were so weighted to a flu outbreak. Prof Graham Medley, a Sage member and the chair of SPI-M - which stands for scientific pandemic influenza - modelling - explains. ""Everything - government preparedness, the modelling - was based on pandemic influenza. And that's not because of lack of awareness on our part, that's because that got the government attention and the funding. We could persuade them that flu was important."" The group's terms of reference were eventually broadened to include different kinds of pandemic but the emphasis lingered.Scientists are used to seeing flu spread through populations very fast, then become milder as it mutates, and to seeing people indeed develop immunity and populations become resistant. Covid-19 is lethally different, new, its properties more uncertain, and the idea of addressing it by allowing it to move through the population and attain herd immunity was widely condemned for risking far too many lives.                                        Herd immunity                                      Given the repeated denials, it can be overlooked that the reason the world believes that attaining herd immunity was the government's approach is largely because Vallance said it was. On Friday 13 March, when the virus was spreading exponentially, he set out publicly to explain the government's strategy.""Our aim is to try and reduce the peak, broaden the peak, not suppress it completely,"" Vallance explained on BBC Radio 4's Today programme : ""Also, because the vast majority of people get a mild illness, to build up some kind of herd immunity, so more people are immune to this disease, and we reduce the transmission. At the same time, we protect those who are most vulnerable to it. Those are the key things we need to do.""Asked on Sky News what proportion of the population would need to become infected to achieve herd immunity, Vallance replied: ""Probably about 60% or so.""Few mitigation measures were yet put in place. The week is remembered for the mega-events that went ahead: the Cheltenham Festival of horseracing, the Liverpool v Atletico Madrid Champions League tie, the Stereophonics concert in Cardiff. In allowing them, the government was indeed, as it consistently said, following the UK science that, surprisingly to many, considers that ""mass gatherings"" do not have a major impact on virus transmission. The numbers of people infected will almost certainly never be known, but the pictures of packed stands, particularly at Cheltenham, have become emblems of the government's delay and inaction.On 11 March, the WHO formally declared Covid-19 a pandemic. Tedros, the director general, maintained that the virus spread could still be confronted, and criticised ""alarming levels of inaction"" by some countries.That same day, a further explanation of the government's strategy was given by Dr David Halpern, a psychologist who heads the Behavioural Insights Team, a company part-owned by the Cabinet Office, which it advises. ""There's going to be a point, assuming the epidemic flows and grows, as we think it probably will do, where you'll want to cocoon, you'll want to protect those at-risk groups so that they basically don't catch the disease, and by the time they come out of their cocooning, herd immunity's been achieved in the rest of the population.""At a press conference the following day, Johnson famously said: ""I must level with the British public: many more families are going to lose loved ones before their time.""Whitty announced then that the initial effort to contain the disease by testing and tracing had been abandoned, yet despite that, and Johnson's dire warning, the measures discussed for the new ""delay"" phase were almost negligible. People over 70 were advised not to go on cruises. Johnson said even ""household quarantine"" would not be required until sometime ""in the next few weeks"". The government's published plan did say that social distancing and school closures could be considered.That evening, the former health secretary Jeremy Hunt spoke on the BBC, saying he was concerned Britain had become an ""outlier"". Hunt says now he became worried that Whitty was too resigned to the virus spreading: ""I couldn't understand why they were so certain that nothing could be done to stop nearly 60% of our population becoming infected, when I had figures showing that even in Wuhan, the centre of the outbreak in China, less than 1% of the population actually became infected.""Vallance made his media appearances the following day, explaining the herd immunity approach. He was asked on Sky News why in the UK ""society was continuing as normal"", and it was put to him that a 60% infection rate would mean ""an awful lot of people dying"". Vallance replied that it was difficult to estimate the number of deaths, but said: ""Well of course we do face the prospect, as the prime minister said yesterday, of an increasing number of people dying.""Matt Hancock, the health secretary, issued the first denial that herd immunity was part of the government's plan, despite Halpern and Vallance having days earlier indicated that it was, in a column in the Sunday Telegraph on 15 March. ""We have a plan, based on the expertise of world-leading scientists,"" Hancock wrote. ""Herd immunity is not a part of it. That is a scientific concept, not a goal or a strategy.""By then, a dizzying number of experts were sounding the alarm. An open letter issued on 14 March dismissing herd immunity as ""not a viable option"" and calling for stricter social distancing measures so that ""thousands of lives can be spared"" was signed by more than 500 UK scientists.Ultimately, the evidence that appears to have prompted the change of course was contained in the Imperial College paper, published on 16 March.                                        A political decision                                      Ferguson's paper has been greatly reported on but somewhat misunderstood. It did suddenly warn that the NHS would be overwhelmed ""eight-fold"", resulting in ""hundreds of thousands of deaths"" if the government did not change its strategy from mitigation to ""suppression"". But the reason was comparatively technical: experience in Italy and of the first UK cases had shown that double the number of intensive care beds was required than previously estimated. The paper sets out the measures that would apparently comprise a mitigation policy, which the government was then planning: ""Case isolation, household quarantine and social distancing of those at higher risk of severe outcomes (older individuals and those with other underlying health conditions) are the most effective policy combination for epidemic mitigation.""Ferguson made it clear to the Guardian that the estimate in that paper of 250,000 deaths was not new and was based on ""the mitigation scenario"". The paper indicated that, in effect, the virus had to be allowed to spread initially, so that over time people would become infected, recover, and attain immunity: ""Introducing such interventions too early risks allowing transmission [of the virus] to return once they are lifted (if insufficient herd immunity has developed).""Ferguson held a press conference on 16 March to explain the new findings. His colleague, Prof Azra Ghani, said: ""Under strategies we were pursuing, we were expecting a degree of herd immunity to build up. If we now realise it's not possible to cope with that in the current health system, and it may not be acceptable in terms of the numbers, then we need to try and reduce transmission.""The Guardian asked Ferguson how that policy could be contemplated, if it predicted that 250,000 people would die. He emphasised that he was never sanguine about people dying, and made it very clear that it was the politicians, not the scientists, who decided on policies to pursue. ""While policy can be guided by scientific advice, that does not mean scientific advisers determine policy,"" he said. ""Though I do try to make it clear to policymakers what the potential consequences of different policies might be, to the extent the science allows.""Prof Graham Medley, another Sage member, and chair of its influential modelling subcommittee, agreed that while the scientists gave their analysis on the epidemic to inform the politicians, deciding what to do was ""a political decision"". Medley told the Guardian that Johnson, Hancock and other ministers continually saying they have been guided by the scientists has ""sometimes gone a bit past the mark"". Asked if he meant that the politicians were passing the buck, Medley replied: ""Yes.""                                        'Drastic action' needed                                      Even after the stark warning that the NHS would be overwhelmed if the policy did not change, Johnson and his government still hesitated. He made another speech that day in which he advised ""drastic action"" was now needed, but the measures were advisory and still tentative. People over 70, pregnant women, and those with some health conditions were advised only to ""avoid all unnecessary social contact"". Britons were asked ""where they possibly can"" to work from home, and Johnson told them ""you should avoid pubs, clubs, theatres and other such social venues"", although all were permitted to stay open.The delay to introducing stricter measures, until the lockdown was finally ordered on 23 March, appears to have been at least partly based on a flawed misreading of the government's own scientific advice. In early March, Whitty mentioned the idea that the government should wait to impose restrictions because people might tire of them, later saying this was based on both ""common sense"" and ""behavioural science"". ""What we are moving now to is a phase when we will be having to ask members of the general public to do different things than they would normally do,"" he said. ""There is a risk if we go too early people will understandably get fatigued and it will be difficult to sustain this over time.""Hancock supported that, suggesting it was the result of official advice. ""The evidence of past epidemics and past crises of this nature shows that people do tire of these sorts of social distancing measures, so if we start them too early, they lose their effect and actually it is worse,"" he said. ""The social science and the behavioural science are a very important part of the scientific advice that we rely on.""Yet this concept of ""fatigue"" was rejected by the behavioural scientists appointed by the government itself to Sage's subcommittee, SPI-B. ""The word was never used in any of our committee reports,"" said Susan Michie, a SPI-B member. ""It is just not a concept that exists in behavioural science, and it was unhelpful for it to be used."" Four other members of SPI-B also told the Guardian that the committee never advised that people would tire of restrictive measures.The publicly available summaries of their conclusions show the group advised that people should be given clear explanations and reasons for social distancing measures, and warn that those measures would affect people unequally, but nowhere do they suggest that people will become ""fatigued"". Three behavioural scientists on SPI-B, Stephen Reicher, John Drury and Clifford Stott, even wrote an article for the Psychologist journal, rejecting the notion of ""fatigue"" and suggesting that delaying stricter social distancing measures on that premise was taking a risk with lives. ""Psychological considerations were put at odds with what medical science demanded,"" they wrote.The Guardian understands that Halpern's Behavioural Insights Team, or ""nudge unit"", was also opposed to this view that people would tire of restrictive measures. One senior Whitehall source said Whitty himself was the main advocate of the ""fatigue"" notion, based partly on his own experience of patients in medical practice who do not see drug prescriptions through to their completion.A Downing Street spokesperson, responding on behalf of Whitty, emphasised that he was indeed concerned about timing interventions, and their impact on people's wellbeing if introduced too early, and that Sage had agreed a balance needed to be struck between the impact of measures, and the time the public could feasibly sustain them.During the week after 16 March, there was a fierce debate within government about whether a stricter lockdown needed to be imposed. ""Several of us thought measures needed to be introduced earlier,"" one source close to the Cabinet Office said. Hancock appears to have been under great pressure, stretched between that view and resistance elsewhere to taking genuinely drastic action. A senior source at the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) recalled discussions about the herd immunity policy continuing, despite Hancock having disowned it, and a senior official still advocating it. ""His basic view was that we were all going to develop antibodies, and ultimately the question was how to manage the release of the disease into the population over time.""The health secretary is said by another well-placed source to have argued forcefully for a lockdown in one Cobra meeting, chaired by Michael Gove, with a junior treasury minister who was resisting due to its huge economic impact and worries that a lockdown would itself kill many people. The source said Hancock kept referring to the modelling that predicted deaths would surge dramatically without a lockdown.The DHSC source sums up this period soberly: ""They knew we would have to go into lockdown; they were debating when. Every single day they wasted, every day we weren't in lockdown, was resulting in people contracting the disease - people who have since died.""One source on Sage said there was also nervousness among their group that week, a feeling that the virus was getting out of control and they were not sure the politicians understood its exponential spread. The advice was being communicated, the source said, but they were told that Whitty and Vallance were having to cajole the politicians in the right direction, and there was ""friction"".Reflecting on the presence at Sage of Cummings and Warner, some attendees now say the group's deliberations were affected by a sense of what could feasibly be done, with a government run by politicians to whom a lockdown looked unthinkable, although others say they were not. Then, that week, when stricter measures were needed, some say it was useful to have Cummings there, because they knew he would communicate that directly to Johnson.One source in Downing Street who personally urged the prime minister to stop delaying and move into lockdown that week said his reticence was partly down to his ""libertarian instinct"". ""There was also a bit of 'rabbit caught in headlights'.""                                        Incubation                                      Ken Sazuze remembers that week very well. He and Elsie, who grew up together in Malawi before he came to Britain and joined the army, were worried, he recalls, particularly about Elsie working without personal protective equipment suitable for Covid-19, and about the coronavirus spreading in Birmingham. She had moved last year from working in NHS hospitals to caring for people in nursing homes, so she could have more regular shifts and help Anna with her GCSEs. That week, Anna's school was open, Andrew was travelling on public transport to Wolverhampton University, where he is in the third year of a finance degree. Ken was on a placement during the final year of his nursing degree, while Elsie was working.""It was still life as normal,"" he says. ""Everywhere was open. People weren't social distancing; they didn't know what to do. We went to the gym, to the shops, to uni, to the library."" On Wednesday 18 March, they went into Birmingham, to the Bullring, shopping for presents for Anna, whose 16th birthday was 10 days away. They went to Marks & Spencer looking for perfume, he remembers, and to an Apple store, where they bought her some AirPods.""We didn't know we were infecting ourselves,"" Ken says. ""I am really annoyed when I start thinking about it too much. I am furious with the government, with people making decisions, that the virus was spreading at that time.""Given the incubation period of Covid-19, Boris Johnson may have contracted the virus that week too. The nation was given the highest profile demonstration of Covid-19's destructive force, as the prime minister went into hospital days later, then into intensive care. While there was great sympathy for Johnson undergoing that personal ordeal, some experts have argued that the spectacle of Johnson, Cummings, Hancock, Whitty and other advisers contracting the virus indicated that the government was not taking social distancing seriously enough. One source in Downing Street the week before the lockdown said they were surprised to find staff at No 10 still shaking hands with visitors.A Downing Street spokesperson made clear they do not accept that Johnson should have been more careful, saying that No 10 did enforce social distancing where practical.                                        Lockdown                                      On 23 March, the lockdown was finally imposed, Johnson clasping his hands during his televised address to the nation, telling people they must stay at home, to save lives and protect the NHS, and go out only for exercise and to shop for essentials.That week, apart from work, Sazuze says he and Elsie only went to Asda and Costco. But on Wednesday 25 March, Elsie began to feel unwell. The unthinkable happened very quickly. Three days later, at 2am, she was struggling with her breathing and had a very high temperature, so they called an ambulance which took her to hospital. By 2 April, Ken had a call with her, on FaceTime, before she was put on a ventilator.""That was my last goodbye with my wife,"" he says. ""We knew it was 50-50 if she went on the ventilator. She said: 'Ken, I've prayed, I've talked to the doctor, I'm happy to do this. I love you, and if anything happens, you look after the children.' I told her: ""Honey, come on, let's think positive; let's not think you're not going to pull through.'""They were called on 8 April at 1am and told to rush to the hospital. He laments that Anna was deemed too young to go into the intensive care unit, and had to be in touch with her and Andrew, by Elsie's side, via FaceTime. ""We were praying,"" he says. ""But there was no response."" That day, 8 April, Elsie was among 938 people reported to have died in hospitals from Covid-19, as the catastrophe in Britain steepled, and so many families, including those of doctors, nurses, other NHS staff and key workers, were plunged into grief.In a response to questions about the government's handling of the Covid-19 pandemic, and whether Johnson regrets any elements of it, Downing Street did not accept any criticisms. A spokesperson replied in a statement:""This is an unprecedented global pandemic and we have taken the right steps at the right time to combat it, guided by the best scientific advice. We are so grateful for the response of the public, who have helped us to slow the spread of the virus and stop the NHS from being overwhelmed. The government has been working day and night to battle coronavirus, delivering a strategy designed to protect our NHS and save lives. Herd immunity has never been a policy or goal. We have provided the NHS with all the support it needs, made sure everyone requiring treatment has received it and taken unprecedented steps to support businesses and workers, to protect the economy.""The spokesperson for Vallance said: ""Herd immunity was a scientific point, that ultimately immunity is an important way to tackle infectious disease, ideally through vaccination.""Ken Sazuze says he understood that this was an unprecedented pandemic, but could not understand how the government could say its response had been faultless. ""I'm in a different world now,"" he says, ""it's something you can't believe. I am angry as well. It would help if they accept their mistakes and apologise. It was slow, the testing and PPE was not adequate, and this virus was allowed to spread. Sometimes you just have to stand up and admit your mistakes, as a human being.""",Newspaper
473,Government rushes out request for experts to work with Sage panel;Notice sent to universities amid concern over lack of expertise in parts of Covid-19 advisory groupCoronavirus - latest updatesSee all our coronavirus coverage,"April 29, 2020 Wednesday",International,The Guardian (London),681,681,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,Ian Sample Science editor,Government rushes out request for experts to work with Sage panelNotice sent to universities amid concern over lack of expertise in parts of Covid-19 advisory groupCoronavirus - latest updatesSee all our coronavirus coverage,"The government has rushed out a request to universities to help expand the pool of scientific experts who are advising ministers during the coronavirus crisis, following concerns about the lack of expertise in some areas.Researchers at British universities received requests on Wednesday morning to work with the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) international and behavioural teams and were asked to declare their interest by the end of Thursday. The experts will not formally join Sage, but will collaborate with them.A notice sent to academics said the Government Office for Science was playing a central role in the UK's response to the epidemic through Sage, the group led by the chief scientific adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance, and that ""they are now looking for additional expert support"".The move comes amid intense scrutiny of the group, whose membership is traditionally kept secret until the emergency being worked on has passed. Since the Guardian revealed the names of two dozen Sage participants last week, critics have raised concerns about            the apparent lack of expertise in a number of areas, notably frontline public health epidemiologists, emergency response specialists and logisticians.The membership of Sage has been thrust into the spotlight amid concerns that ministers have failed in key areas of Britain's response to coronavirus, from acting too slowly,            lagging behind on testing, and having            insufficient supplies of personal protective equipment, all while insisting they were following            ""the best science"".The presence at Sage meetings of Dominic Cummings, the prime minister's chief political adviser, has fuelled further questions about the scientific advice No 10 is receiving. Sir David King, a former chief scientific adviser, warned that Cummings's participation in the meetings was problematic as he would relay his interpretation of the discussions directly to Boris Johnson.On Monday, Scotland's first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, complained of a ""deficiency"" in the system for providing scientific advice, saying she was unhappy that the chief scientist for the Scottish government did not have full participation in Sage meetings.Vallance said earlier this week the Sage advisers and those on its subgroups would be named ""shortly"" unless individuals objected. The documents Sage has reviewed during its meetings will also be published as soon as permission from the relevant authors had been granted, he added.Academics will work with the advisory groups for an initial three-month secondment and spend their time supporting expert meetings, tracking and summarising key research and scientific developments, and liaising with a wide range of experts to understand the latest picture on the virus.One advert calls for researchers to assist the international group of Sage's Covid-19 response team. The advert casts a wide net, seeking experts in global public health, health systems, epidemiology, infectious diseases, emerging diseases, and social or behavioural sciences.The second advert calls for experts to support the scientific pandemic influenza group on behaviours, or SPI-B, a subgroup of the Sage Covid-19 response team. The specialisms being sought are behavioural psychology, health psychology, behaviour change and behavioural economic. Duties will range from turning the group's discussions into consensus statements and performing research, for example, on public perceptions and likely responses to policy decisions, according to the advert.A Government Office for Science spokesperson said: ""Scientists working with the Government Office for Science are playing an integral and continued role in the UK's response to the coronavirus outbreak.""As this advert makes clear, we are continuing to expand our deep and diverse pool of expertise with secondments available to the best and brightest academics. These roles will form part of the GO-Science team and are do not relate to expert participants of the Sage committee.""Coronavirus and volunteering: how can I help in the UK?",Newspaper
474,Putting millions in quarantine till 2021 is discriminatory,"April 29, 2020 Wednesday",International,thetimes.co.uk,441,441,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,Sean O'Neill,Putting millions in quarantine till 2021 is discriminatory,"Some sort of new normal, involving facemasks, polite distancing and small family gatherings, is on the way - for most of the population.For another 10.2 million people, however, there is little prospect of any easing of the lockdown. These are the 8.7 million over-70s and the 1.5 million people who have been declared extremely clinically vulnerable.They are the shielders. The existing guidance from coronavirus headquarters in Whitehall states that they must stay indoors, avoid face-to-face contact and stay six feet away from members of their families. If they crave fresh air they should sit near an open window for a while.According to some of the thinking seemingly leaking from nudge unit gurus, the lockdown could be eased by a traffic light system, with the over-70s and the vulnerable remaining stuck on red well into 2021.Such a discriminatory policy is unsustainable. The blanket ""stay home"" policy was tolerable for a short while at the start of the emergency but it is time for some more refined thinking on the subject.Take the over-70s. I can think of two friends in that bracket who simply should not be lumped together in a one-size-fits-all policy. One is never more at home than in the pub with a pint of Guinness and his newspaper. The other cannot be contained indoors and is already breaching the guidelines by cycling at least 30 miles a day on quiet country roads.Personally, I am living with leukaemia and therefore classed as one of the extremely vulnerable. Yet a detailed analysis of the first 6,000 patients receiving critical care in hospital for Covid-19 recorded fewer than 1.5 per cent with blood cancers.This could be because leukaemia patients, already used to having compromised immune systems and being extremely cautious about infections, are taking the shielding advice very seriously. Or could it be that we are not as badly affected by coronavirus as first predicted?I am not saying we should throw caution to the wind. But, in the light of the torrent of medical data that has poured in since the outbreak began, some of the assumptions that underpinned the original shielding advice should be revisited. For example, issues about susceptibility to the virus have emerged around ethnicity, diabetes and weight. This is a new disease and medical researchers are learning new things every day about how it behaves, who is most at risk and how to treat it.Some of that learning must be taken into account to produce more nuanced advice, rather than another dictum confining more than ten million citizens to their homes for months without end.

Coronavirus - latest updatesSee all our coronavirus coverageFor home delivery, click here","From cheques bearing the signature of the market-loving president of the United States to mountains of state money being used around the world to help businesses and individuals - the era of big government is back. That may have seemed impossible in some countries in December, but the economic devastation of the pandemic has turned decades' worth of economic orthodoxies on their head. This, argues world affairs editor Julian Borger in this week's cover story, could be a moment of transformation on a par with the New Deal in 1930s America.Elsewhere in our latest extended look at the impact of the pandemic, Justin McCurry reports on how well the South Korean government handled the country's initially daunting outbreak. What lessons can other countries learn?Other nations that have been widely praised for their handling of the outbreak include Germany, New Zealand, Taiwan, Finland and Denmark. What connects them? Well, for one - write Jon Henley and            Eleanor Ainge Roy - they all have female leaders, whose grown-up responses to containing the virus have contrasted markedly to some more bombastic male counterparts, such as Jair Bolsonaro, Rodrigo Duterte and the bleach-pushing commander-in-chief himself, Donald Trump.            Simon Tisdall wraps up the responses of the planet's toxic male leaders to the crisis.Despite the success of some countries, the scientific and political consensus is that we cannot return to anything like normality until a vaccine is found. So how far are we away from one?This week, science correspondent Hannah Devlin goes on the trail of a working vaccine - from recently announced human trials at Oxford University to other labs around the world working to beat the virus.The World Health Organization is following more than 70 candidate vaccines, some already at the trial stage, so there's plenty of hope - but still a chance that none will work. And, even if they do, tricky questions remain: how can they be scaled up at speed and who will get them first?Watching that process closely will be virologist Christian Drosten, the German government's go-to expert on the virus. In a fascinating interview with Laura Spinney, he gives his take on how best to beat Covid-19. And why he'd be interested to study China's population of raccoon dogs ...We also have more great reads later in the magazine.

476,"How long will the UK coronavirus lockdown last?;Dominic Raab has extended UK lockdown for a further three weeks and said restrictions will not be lifted until changes can be ""safely"" made","April 29, 2020 Wednesday",International,telegraph.co.uk,1101,1101,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,"By Sarah Knapton, Science Editor","How long will the UK coronavirus lockdown last?Dominic Raab has extended UK lockdown for a further three weeks and said restrictions will not be lifted until changes can be ""safely"" made","The Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab has extended UK lockdown measures for a further three weeks to prevent the spread of            Covid-19. The announcement on Thursday 16 April came hours after Mr Raab chaired a Cobra meeting to discuss the current social restrictions in place.The extension has been put in place for ""at least"" three weeks which will take the UK to May 7, when we can expect a second review.Mr Raab, who deputised for Boris Johnson, said the Government was being ""as open as we responsibly can at this stage"". ""It would not be responsible to prejudge the evidence that Sage will have and review in just a few weeks' time.""The Foreign Secretary said the Government carefully followed what is happening in other countries but ""we've got to do what is right for the British people based on the advice of our experts, grounded in the conditions prevailing here in the UK"".He said that measures put in place had been successful but that SAGE said that some settings were still seeing infections spreading.He warned that relaxing social restrictions now would damage economy in the longterm.•: How other countries are ending lockdown                     Is lockdown working?                     Less than 12 hours after the Prime Minister's historic address to the nation on March 23, the London Underground was jammed with commuters (see video below), while builders were seen eating together in communal canteens, making a mockery of the Government's rule that no more than two people can gather together in public.Professor Susan Michie, Director of the University College London's Centre for Behaviour Change, warned that some people would simply not be able to carry out the measures, even if they wanted to.""Five million self-employed people are being left potentially destitute by the Government failing to offer financial supportas they have done for directly employed workers,"" she said. ""Since [statutory sick pay of] £94 is not enough to pay rent, bills, food for a family etc, they will be forced to carry on as usual.""The British Transport Police is now on hand to make sure only            critical workers are using the London Underground. But such an inauspicious start to the lockdown suggests the virus will spread further than it would have, had stricter measures been implemented earlier,            as they have in other countries. And it means that the measures we do have are likely to be in place for longer to ""flatten the curve"" in a way that would prevent a second dangerous peak.In addition, on April 1 the Government revealed figures that suggested the lockdown was starting to fray as data showed an ""uptick""            in the number of people using transport.The number of those using their cars and public transport, which had been consistently dropping since strict social distancing measures were introduced, rose for the first time.It is feared that sunny weather will prompt more people to break the rules and go outside to socialise as boredom kicks in.•: Can I go for a drive during lockdown?How long will lockdown last?Mr Raab said the Government needed to be satisfied of five things before it would consider it safe to adjust any of the current measures:•Protect the NHS's ability to cope and be confident that the NHS is able to provide sufficient critical care across the UK.•See a sustained and consistent fall in daily death rates to be confident the UK is beyond the peak.•Reliable data from Sage showing rate of infection is decreasing to manageable levels across the board.•Confident that testing capacity and PPE are in hand with supply able to meet future demand.•Confident that any adjustments to the current measures would not risk a second peak in infections which would overwhelm the NHS.When the lockdown was first announced, Professor Mark Woolhouse, Professor of Infectious Disease Epidemiology, University of Edinburgh, said: ""We now enter a phase of careful monitoring. We are looking for indicators first that the epidemic is slowing down and then for numbers of new cases to start to fall. ""After three weeks we will have to decide whether the restrictions need to be continued, can be relaxed, or can be relaxed temporarily with the expectation of imposing them again later. ""We must also monitor the damage that the lockdown is doing; damage to the economy, to education, to psychological well-being and to health and social care provision in the community. The impacts of this epidemic are too far reaching for policy decisions to be driven by epidemiology alone.""Professor Sheila Bird said that more cases in coming weeks would make it easier for the Government to predict how the epidemic is responding to lockdown measures, which will inform how long they remain in place. ""Once an epidemic takes hold, as now in UK, the country's own data - properly reported and interpreted - take precedence over modelling as the data tell us the actual toll which the epidemic is exacting,"" she said.""A huge amount can be inferred about the immediately forthcoming weeks from these data directly, including whether further policy changes are needed to reinforce social-distancing; for example in particular age groups.""Some experts are still concerned that the current restrictions do not go far enough while others say the government has been hit by an ""epidemic of action"", and is now bringing in measures that have little rationale. Professor Robert Dingwall, Professor of Sociology, at Nottingham Trent University, wrote in The Telegraph: ""It is another triumph of populism over science, of a capitulation to the demand to 'do something'. ""We are still seeing some notion that 'the people' are selfish and must be bullied and disciplined. ""The people are not selfish; they have behaved in ways that are individually rational but have collectively irrational results.""However Dr Andrea Collins, Senior Clinical Lecturer in Respiratory Medicine at the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine (LSTM), said: ""I believe that they have not quite gone far enough. The 'absolutely' necessary to go to work is still being used by some when it is not required-I think we need permits across controlled areas to go to a workplace.""Recent modelling from the universities of Exeter, Bristol and Warwick suggested that without any measures at all, the epidemic would have peaked around 133 days after first person-to-person transmission in Britain, which happened around February 28. So the lockdown has the potential of curtailing the spread by around seven weeks. A welcome relief for people who could have been facing lockdown for most of the summer.",Newspaper; Web Publication
477,NHS contact tracing app could be ready in two weeks,"April 29, 2020 Wednesday",International,The Independent (United Kingdom),478,478,England & Wales,KATE DEVLIN WHITEHALL EDITOR,NHS contact tracing app could be ready in two weeks,"A coronavirus app being developed by the NHS could be ready in a fortnight, its creators said yesterday.Matthew Gould, CEO of the NHSX digital arm, said the contact tracing technology would be ready in ""two to three weeks"". The app, backed by Matt Hancock, the health secretary, is a key plank of ministers' plans to prevent a second peak in coronavirus cases.However, it will not be finished before 7 May, when ministers are legally bound to review the lockdown.Once downloaded, the app will detect when two smartphones are within 2m of each other, and for how long. Users would receive an amber warning if the corresponding user shows symptoms or a red warning if they test positive. Other countries such as Singapore and Iceland have already developed similar apps.Giving evidence to MPs on the Commons Science and Technology Committee, Mr Gould played down the idea that the app would initially be rolled out nationwide. Instead, it was likely to be tested in a number of ""small"" geographical areas, he said.He told MPs: ""I would expect it technically to be ready for wider deployment in two to three weeks. Whether it is then deployed depends on the wider strategy.""That strategy includes other restrictions imposed by the government, he said, including whether or not social distancing measures were still in place.He also predicted that, in order for the app to gain enough users to be successful, ministers would have to send a tough message to the public.Experts believe between 60 and 80 per cent of smartphone users would have to download the app to successfully slow the spread of the disease. Even then, users would have to obey strict rules and self-isolate if they received a message that they had been in contact with someone who was infected.Mr Gould admitted that it would be ""tough"" to get 80 per cent of smartphone users to install the contact-tracing app.Urging individuals to use the technology had to be part of the government's ""core message"" around coronavirus, he said.He said: ""The message needs to be: if you want to keep your family and yourselves safe, if you want to protect the NHS and stop it being overwhelmed and at the same time get the country back and get the economy moving, the app is going to be an essential part of the strategy for doing that.""Earlier, Professor Susan Michie, from University College London, who sits on a subcommittee of the Sage group, which advises the government, dismissed the idea that those who have already had coronavirus would be able to secure an immunity ""passport"".Her criticism was shared by Danny Altmann, professor of immunology at Imperial College London, who warned that scientists won't know for up to a year how long immunity to coronavirus lasts. He told MPs that scientists ""haven't the foggiest notion"" of what a positive test for a past case of Covid-19 would mean for future immunity.",Newspaper
478,Lockdown: government must show light at the end of the tunnel,"April 30, 2020 Thursday",International,thetimes.co.uk,834,834,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,Steve Martin,Lockdown: government must show light at the end of the tunnel,"The end of the Great British Lockdown may be approaching. After weeks of angst, uncertainty and apprehension the talk is of a country allowed outside once again, to work, socialise and sunbathe. Any relaxation of social distancing measures, however, could be short-lived. What if we have to go back inside later in the year? How will the government persuade the public, short on money and patience, to comply all over again?And persuasion will be key. If the public can't be voluntarily convinced, then enforcement may be the only option - a disastrous outcome for all concerned.What can the government do now, to increase the chances of future public co-operation? For a potential answer imagine the following. Post-lockdown you decide to take your family on a well-earned (and legally permitted) holiday. Imagine further, that on arrival at the airport, you are offered an unexpected, free upgrade to first class. The agent at the check-in desk explains that you can travel in style either on the way out or on your return. Which do you choose?There is a clear answer, at least to behavioural scientists. You will be much happier and have fonder memories of your trip if you travel first-class on the journey home rather than the outbound one. Why? Because our memories of experiences, even the most recent ones, are seared into our minds with extremity and recency.This is not mere speculation. Scientists have demonstrated this phenomenon time and time again.Take, for example, one of the better-known demonstrations of this ""peak-end"" effect by Nobel laureate Daniel Kahneman, who asked people to place their arm in a bucket of cold water for a whole minute. It's an uncomfortable experience that few would willingly repeat. Yet, a short time later those same subjects were asked to submerge their other arm in the bucket of cold water, again for 60 seconds. This time, however, after a minute they were asked to keep their arm in the bucket for a further 30 seconds, during which time the temperature of the water was increased by 1C. Everyone was then asked which of these two experiences they would like to repeat. Sixty seconds of pain? Or sixty seconds of pain, plus thirty seconds of additional, slightly less severe pain? Most chose the latter.The water experiment is a good illustration of how our memories of painful experiences are distorted by how they end. It also demonstrates how, in our overall assessment of an experience, we frequently disregard how long it lasted - something us behavioural scientists call ""duration neglect"".Examples aren't limited to airline upgrades and psychologists with their buckets of cold water. The waiter who accidentally spills coffee or is rude at the end of an otherwise wonderful evening out can ruin the whole experience. A romantic weekend away can be spoiled by a silly argument on the way home. While these unfortunate endings do nothing to erase the actual experience, they do loom large when we look back on those experiences.Bottom line? Our memory of how things end matters - a lot. This insight is not only important. It also presents a unique opportunity for the chancellor.As we come out of this period of coronavirus lockdown, steps need to be taken to ensure things end well for the majority. Implementing such a policy would be extremely effective without needing to be expensive. What if every UK citizen, a week before the lockdown is relaxed, was given a voucher with a cash value to spend as they wish? A nice bottle of wine from the local off-licence. A takeaway. Money towards lunch and ice creams on a family day out. Some may choose to give theirs to an NHS or key worker who supported them through the crisis. It could even provide a welcome boost to the economy if people spend their money with independent local suppliers. Perhaps delivery firms such as Deliveroo, Amazon and Just Eat could be persuaded to play their part too?What matters here is the principle. A little extra investment in making sure things end well represents good value. Not to mention the resultant social capital earned, especially if the need for a further lockdown arises. Our willingness to go back into lockdown is likely to be a little more bearable if our memories of the first lockdown are slightly less awful.Throughout this pandemic the government has, with painstaking relentlessness, pointed to how its strategies are grounded in the best available scientific data and evidence. The same should be true of its end. The science tells us that to maintain public support and maintain a semblance of wellbeing the lockdown needs to end well.Accordingly, it is contingent on the chancellor to do his bit in contributing to a happy ending.

After a month in isolation, a difficult morning on Zoom and a steady drumbeat of bad tidings for business, she needed some air.""You can imagine the kind of board meetings we have been having,"" says Missoni, the creative director of a label founded by her parents, Ottavio and Rosita, in 1953. ""It has been kind of intense.""Missoni is a charismatic woman with an easy smile, a mane of dark curls and a disarming earth-mother air. Yet she is also a hardheaded businesswoman, one who has driven the global growth of her family enterprise.She is not, in other words, a woo-woo.And yet when, on her walk in the garden, she spotted a four-leaf clover in the grass, she was struck by a premonition, she says. Despite the gloom, the grim economic forecast, the generalised terrors harassing a world consumed by the coronavirus, all, she felt, would be well.""To have found one right after this meeting, I suddenly thought, 'OK, that's a very good sign,'"" Missoni, 62, says by phone. ""You know, as soon as you smile, already your whole body is benefiting from your state of mind.""Both social and medical science have long correlated stressful conditions with upticks in magical thinking. And yet there are discernible beneficial effects to be found in our fascination with talismans, luck charms, rituals and that grab bag of superstitious acts we sometimes reach for to ward off the caprices of fate.""The main purpose of everyday superstition is to give a sense of control in circumstances where it's lacking,"" says Stuart Vyse, a psychologist and author.Vyse's latest book, Superstition: A Very Short Introduction, is an example of destiny's heedlessness of everyday human concerns. Published in March, it made it into bookstores just in time for the coronavirus to shut down nonessential businesses.""The very nature of this epidemic is one of uncertainty, not knowing whether you have come into contact with the virus,"" Vyse says. ""So, this circumstance is a perfect one in which to grasp for something that can't have a real effect - because there is no real magic in the world - but that supports a psychological feeling that you have taken some action, done some small thing to regain control.""Control, of course, is what we lack at a time of ambiguous and daily evolving governmental guidelines, with the enforced passivity of sheltering in place.It turns out that, even after you have knitted, darned, worked crosswords, built jigsaw puzzles, rearranged your sock drawer and participated in enough virtual meetings to make you long for a time when the disembodied people on screen were attached to limbs and torsos, anxiety still manages to creep in. Like a mephitic vapour from a sword-and-sandals epic, it slips under the door frame and into your head. It is then that people reach for the worry beads.As a child growing up in Rome, Francesca Amfitheatrof, the artistic director of watches and jewellery for Louis Vuitton, was terrified of putting her hand in the city's fabled Mouth of Truth, a monumental mask set into a wall outside the 11th-century Basilica of Santa Maria in Cosmedin.""Legend has it that, if you told lies, it would bite off your fingers,"" Amfitheatrof says from her house in Connecticut, where she is staying during the pandemic with her husband and two children.At her bedside there, Amfitheatrof, 51, keeps a pendant version of the Bocca della Verita, as the mask is known in Italian, part of a necklace once belonging to an aunt, a ""true, original Seventies Cali hippie"" who later relocated to Rome.""I loved my Aunt Stella, and I keep this necklace next to the bed because I feel she protects me,"" Amfitheatrof says, adding that she considers the talisman a shield not only from ""the virus but from this sense that there are people bending truth now for gains that are not acceptable"".On the walls of her Berlin apartment, Tara Reddi, an art dealer, has arranged a collection of ex-votos, votive offerings customarily associated with divine intervention in calamities. Except during the hand washing that has taken on its own ritual qualities during the pandemic, she never removes her mother's lucky bloodstone signet ring.""My mother survived World War II and knew what sacrifice and hardship meant,"" says Reddi, 64, who maintains a semiregular isolation diary on Instagram (@tkr340) that she uses to face down the demons of loneliness with humour and elaborate domestic rituals.Ever since the coronavirus was first identified in the USA, Peter Speliopoulos, 59, a ceramic artist and the former creative director at Donna Karan, has chosen to wear a 1930s ring by the Zuni carver Leekya Deyuse. The ring of turquoise, a stone said to have healing powers, depicts a snake and is always worn, superstitiously, by Speliopoulos ""with the head facing out"" for added protection.Recently Catherine Kitz, 60, the events services manager at the Oakland Museum in California, has found herself transferring from bag to wallet to backpack a single lucky dollar folded into a triangle - an adaptation of a South Asian Muslim custom for safeguarding travellers - given to her years ago by a friend.And Sheila Donnelly, the owner of a public relations agency who is in her sixties and lives on the Hawaiian island of Oahu with her husband, writer Paul Theroux, carries a casino chip from Macao that she rubs to bestow luck on those around her, as well as to invoke the guardianship of her Chinese ancestors.For Siddhartha Shukla, the chief brand officer at the fashion company Theory, the talisman for these parlous times is a miniature devotional prayer book of silver, dedicated to the Hindu monkey god Hanuman, a gift from his mother.""It was made by a silversmith in India, and it fits in the palm of my hand,"" says Shukla, 41. ""Hanuman represents strength, perseverance and devotion, and it has been a constant reminder of those qualities"" as well as a way of keeping his mother near him.""Yes, I have my personal talisman,"" Tommaso Sacchi, the deputy mayor for culture, fashion and design of Florence, Italy, wrote in a recent email, a day after Pope Francis celebrated Mass in an eerily vacant St Peter's Square.""It is a book that gives me the courage to live through these horrible days of fighting the virus,"" Sacchi, 37, says of a privately printed volume of memories of the Second World War, written by a 22-year-old partisan fighting in the hills of northern Italy. ""My luck charm is the book of this old man,"" Sacchi says, meaning his 98-year-old grandfather, Edoardo Sacchi. ""In this time, we give renewed value to our roots, our grannies and grandpas, the most fragile elements of this whole horrible attack.""In a sense, Sacchi's luck charm, rooted as it is in an unlikely tale of survival, is more rational than most. Yet it is not fundamentally removed from the widespread custom of bypassing a 13th floor in elevators and high-rises, knocking on wood or not walking under ladders. Millions of us, despite knowing them to be irrational, daily abide by quirky yet soothing rituals.""When I left New York for Canada to quarantine for an indefinite amount of time, there was only one thing I consciously took as a good luck charm of sorts,"" says Emily Bode, 30, a menswear designer, referring to her grandmother's red zip-up ski sweater. ""I always make sure I wear it on a plane or have it in my purse. It's comforting for me to have something that not only have I loved for over 15 years but that has been a part of my mother's entire life and my late grandmother's.""Continuity, on a global scale, has rarely felt more fragile than during the pandemic, according to Jane Risen, a professor of behavioural science at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business. ""We like to be able to predict and control our environments, and even an illusory sense of predictability is better than not having any,"" she says. ""People are looking for anything to stabilise themselves.""Even so simple a symbolic gesture as touching one's heart after hand washing, she adds, can be seen as a form of sympathetic magic.And that, says Stacy Rapp, 46, the head witch at Enchantments, a decades-old occult supplies store in New York, is just what we need. ""Everyone is sitting there and freaking out in their own little houses,"" she says.So why not light a candle? Lighting a candle is important in many religious traditions as an offering to the universe or for connecting with a higher power, Rapp notes.""Candle magic is accessible to everyone, and it's a way to stay calm,"" she says. ""That's important because, at the moment, our biggest enemy is fear.""© The New York Times",Newspaper

And it means that the measures we do have are likely to be in place for longer to ""flatten the curve"" in a way that would prevent a second dangerous peak.In addition, on April 1 the Government revealed figures that suggested the lockdown was starting to fray as data showed an ""uptick""            in the number of people using transport.The number of those using their cars and public transport, which had been consistently dropping since strict social distancing measures were introduced, rose for the first time.It is feared that sunny weather will prompt more people to break the rules and go outside to socialise as boredom kicks in.•: Can I go for a drive during lockdown?How long will lockdown last?Mr Raab said the Government needed to be satisfied of five things before it would consider it safe to adjust any of the current measures:•Protect the NHS's ability to cope and be confident that the NHS is able to provide sufficient critical care across the UK.•See a sustained and consistent fall in daily death rates to be confident the UK is beyond the peak.•Reliable data from Sage showing rate of infection is decreasing to manageable levels across the board.•Confident that testing capacity and PPE are in hand with supply able to meet future demand.•Confident that any adjustments to the current measures would not risk a second peak in infections which would overwhelm the NHS.When the lockdown was first announced, Professor Mark Woolhouse, Professor of Infectious Disease Epidemiology, University of Edinburgh, said: ""We now enter a phase of careful monitoring.

""We must also monitor the damage that the lockdown is doing; damage to the economy, to education, to psychological well-being and to health and social care provision in the community. The impacts of this epidemic are too far reaching for policy decisions to be driven by epidemiology alone.""Professor Sheila Bird said that more cases in coming weeks would make it easier for the Government to predict how the epidemic is responding to lockdown measures, which will inform how long they remain in place. ""Once an epidemic takes hold, as now in UK, the country's own data - properly reported and interpreted - take precedence over modelling as the data tell us the actual toll which the epidemic is exacting,"" she said.""A huge amount can be inferred about the immediately forthcoming weeks from these data directly, including whether further policy changes are needed to reinforce social-distancing; for example in particular age groups.""Some experts are still concerned that the current restrictions do not go far enough while others say the government has been hit by an ""epidemic of action"", and is now bringing in measures that have little rationale. Professor Robert Dingwall, Professor of Sociology, at Nottingham Trent University, wrote in The Telegraph: ""It is another triumph of populism over science, of a capitulation to the demand to 'do something'.

488,RBS scraps digital bank Bó after just five months,"May 1, 2020 Friday",International,thetimes.co.uk,322,322,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,Katherine Griffiths,RBS scraps digital bank Bó after just five months,"Royal Bank of Scotland is scrapping Bó, its digital bank, to focus on lending to customers struggling to cope with the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic and consequent lockdown of the economy.Bó's prospects had appeared to be gloomy in January when RBS announced the departure of Mark Bailie, who had set up the digital lender. Mr Bailie had been a contender for the chief executive role at RBS before losing out to Alison Rose in November.RBS spent tens of millions of pounds creating the new lender, which it believed was a more cost-effective approach than buying an independent financial technology company. It issued a bright yellow card that it believed would attract younger customers.The business was launched in November and used social influencers in its advertising campaign. It ran into immediate problems after critics said that its functionality was inferior to that of established rivals such as Monzo and Revolut.Bó's technology will be wrapped into Mettle, a digital bank for small business customers that had been developed by Ms Rose when she led the commercial banking department.Ms Rose said that Bó, which has 11,000 customers, had not failed. ""We have made a prudent decision to merge the technology platforms of Bó and Mettle,"" she said. ""As I have always said, we will apply a disciplined view in terms of our approach to innovations - testing and learning."" She added that the bank's priorities were elsewhere. ""Clearly in the current situation we've had to make prioritisation choices about where we will invest.""Bó was created to help people who were not on top of their finances, irrespective of their salary, by offering ways to set budgets and save money. According to its research 40 per cent of working-age adults in Britain - about 17 million people - have less than £100 in savings.

This total lockdown is failing;We should focus on the areas where infection is most likely - and liberate the countryside, playgrounds and pub gardens Coronavirus latest updates See all our coronavirus coverage","May 1, 2020 Friday",International,The Guardian (London),900,900,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,Simon Jenkins,"Why can I visit a DIY shop but not a museum? This total lockdown is failingWe should focus on the areas where infection is most likely - and liberate the countryside, playgrounds and pub gardens Coronavirus latest updates See all our coronavirus coverage","A woman sits on a bench by the Thames. Two policemen arrive and tell her to stand up. Two boys remove their shirts in Holland Park. They are told to put them back on. A policeman shouts at two girls in bikinis on Primrose Hill to get dressed. How dare they enjoy themselves.You can crowd a London Tube train but not climb a Welsh mountain. You can drive to a country footpath, but only if the walk takes longer than the drive. Michael Gove will allow you out ""just for an hour"". The trouble with official curbs on personal freedoms is that they degenerate into idiot authoritarianism. Rules become ever more pernickety, because their enforcers regard mere enjoyment as abuse. Gove's            directorate is like The Handmaid's Tale, if not Oliver Cromwell. The latter's blue laws similarly told women how to dress, and banned walks, pubs, plays, sports and the celebration of festivals. To unbridled power, the only lawful activity is one ""necessary"" to the security of the state.Is pleasure really unnecessary and happiness a menace? This week's superb BBC Four documentary on Oxford's Young Rembrandt exhibition, narrated off-screen by Simon Schama, left me delighted but baffled. Why can I crowd Oxford's supermarkets but not its Ashmolean Museum? Why are people trusted to ""socially distance"" in a            DIY shop but not in a garden centre or a National Trust park? My local hardware store can sell from its front door, but not my local pub.Only time will tell whose model of coronavirus was correct, and which government's means of combating it was most effective. Out of a sort of desperation, we have all become statistical nerds, and we strive to be objective. I remain on the side of the Swedes Johan Giesecke and            Anders Tegnell (and Boris Johnson mark one), and against Britain's Neil Ferguson (and Johnson mark two). The former seem to reflect common sense and behavioural science, the latter mathematical dogma and worst-case scenarios. Sweden's deaths per million, at 244, are currently well behind Britain's, at 384.To unbridled power, the only lawful activity is one 'necessary' to the security of the stateI am equally drawn to the Oxford geographer Danny Dorling's intriguing research suggesting that coronavirus not only peaked in mid-April but appears to follow a similar trajectory everywhere, seemingly regardless of local policy and probably with similar fatality rates. The big difference will be in the collateral damage of their various forms of lockdown.As the Swedish scientists point out, this is a peculiar virus in that its overwhelming - though not most publicised - impact is in exacerbating existing illnesses in old people. This is 80-90% of deaths. Many are already ""locked down"" in care homes and hospitals. It would therefore make sense to direct all energy at protecting and trying to cure them. Yet while Britain was playing at The Handmaid's Tale, it was leaving care homes to look after themselves, to an appalling extent in those known to me.For most other people - children, young people, even the middle aged - the risk of fatality, though tragic, is statistically minimal. Countries that have trusted people to observe voluntary distancing have not seen radically different fatalities from countries that have been draconian. Sweden's victims have been overwhelmingly in already locked-down care homes, not in the general population. The same has been true in voluntarist Germany.I can accept that, with an unknown and lethal disease, some application of the precautionary principle should apply. But even then, it would make sense to relate lockdown to relative risk, if only to minimise harm to the nation's wider, non-Covid-19-related, physical and mental health. One-size-fits-all lockdown abuses any concept of priority. Hence 18,000 possible extra cancer deaths are now predicted.Britain's failure - unique in Europe - to involve its local government in lockdown decisions or remedial measures has clearly been a serious error. It delayed action on protective equipment, as well as on testing and chasing. To have to call in the army rather than use local councils and officials was crass. It will clearly impede the local easing of lockdown. I have still seen no good argument for keeping schools closed, just mindless Downing Street dogma.One size never fits all. Just as Covid-19 is selective, so surely can be the escape from it. The risk of infection is known to be greater in cities than elsewhere. So liberate the counties and countryside. The risk is greater indoors, so liberate outdoor trading. The risk is greater to the vulnerable old, so stop stifling the social and economic activities of the young. If you liberate high-risk Tube trains and supermarkets, why not low-risk playgrounds, public footpaths, pub gardens and local churches? If there really is a second peak - and there is always a risk - then we should be like Germany, and face it when it occurs. Meanwhile there is no question of a risk to lives and livelihoods in prolonging lockdown: that is a certainty.Britain has not been exceptional in much, except in its refusal to inform and debate with the public over lockdown. It has behaved like an old-fashioned centralist bureaucracy, with ministers and officials mouthing slogans and giving orders. What is the matter with the government? Why can't we sit on a bench?

491,"Coronavirus lockdown: set free healthy over-70s, say doctors;Blanket ban on old is 'discriminatory', union warns","May 2, 2020 Saturday",International,thetimes.co.uk,2095,2095,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,"Caroline Wheeler, Nicholas Hellen, Tim Shipman and Chris Smyth","Coronavirus lockdown: set free healthy over-70s, say doctorsBlanket ban on old is 'discriminatory', union warns","Lockdown should be eased for the healthy over-70s because keeping them inside is damaging their mental health, senior doctors warned Boris Johnson last night.The British Medical Association (BMA) and the Royal College of GPs intervened to say that age alone should not determine people's ability to go about their daily lives when the government begins easing the lockdown restrictions.All those aged 70 and over, regardless of health conditions, have been classified as ""clinically vulnerable"" and told to be especially stringent in minimising contact with those outside their household. Some ministers have said this may need to last until a vaccine is available, which could take a year or more.But in a statement, the BMA said: ""A blanket ban on any section of the population being prohibited from lockdown easing would be discriminatory and unacceptable.""The doctors' union said the government should ensure that ""those at highest risk from infection are protected"", but added: ""This needs to be based on individual risk that would apply at all ages rather than an arbitrary age of 60 or 70.""The health secretary defended the advice, saying that there was no ""blanket ban"" on the over-70s leaving their homes.""We have strongly advised all over-70s to follow social distancing measures,"" Mr Hancock wrote. ""However, there is no blanket ban, and the suggestion that the clinically vulnerable include people aged 70 or older regardless of medical conditions is wrong and deeply misleading.""However, advice published on the Government website on Friday includes the words: ""Clinically vulnerable people are those who are: aged 70 or older (regardless of medical conditions)...""Michael Gove, the Cabinet Office minister, said that the ""worst thing to do would be to prematurely relax the current measures to see a second spike which one risk overwhelming the NHS and which would compel us to introduce lockdown measures, all over again. That would be the most dangerous course, I think for us to take.""He said that any easing of the lockdown ""[would not be] flicking a switch again from one situation back to the old normal"".He also told the daily Downing Street media briefing that the government could impose localised restrictions if needed. ""A phased approach is one which allows us to monitor the impact that those changes are having on public health and, if necessary, in a specific and localised way,"" he said. ""That means that we can pause, or even reintroduce those restrictions that might be required in order to deal with localised outbreaks of the disease.""He announced that the number of people who had died with coronavirus in the UK had risen by 315, taking the total to 28,446. The number of daily tests being carried out fell to below 80,000 just days after Matt Hancock announced that the government had met its targets of 100,000 tests a day by the end of April. Government statistics showed that 76,496 were carried out in the 24 hours to 9am today.The comedian Sir Michael Palin, 76, said today that age restrictions would be ""very difficult and very wrong and very unfair"".The former pensions minister Baroness Altmann, 64, said that using age-based criteria to lift restrictions would send a message that older people ""don't count in the same way as others"".The Department of Health and Social Care said the over-70s ""are not included in the most at-risk group (extremely clinically vulnerable), who have been told to isolate for 12 weeks"".Last night, Mr Johnson's father, Stanley, urged him to end restrictions in time for his 80th birthday in August when he hopes to climb Mount Kilimanjaro to raise money for the Save the Asian Elephant charity. ""I am rather hoping they will ease the restrictions in time,"" he said.As the death toll rose yesterday to 28,131 - a rise of 621 - the prime minister summoned ministers and aides to Downing Street to thrash out a ""whack-a-mole"" exit strategy, which he is due to publish on Thursday. Under the plans, he will unveil a slow easing of the lockdown but warn that where virus ""hotspots"" erupt, a tougher localised lockdown could be imposed.Officials will only tweak the lockdown this week, encouraging building sites to reopen, relaxing rules on outdoor activities, urging people to cover their faces on public transport and key workers to put their children back in school.Businesses will be given three weeks to prepare work spaces so people can remain socially distanced. Johnson will then lay out proposals to make bigger changes at the end of May. They will see pupils who have key tests or exams next year (Sats, GCSEs and A-levels), return to school, and more retailers, such as garden centres, reopen. Office workers will be told to stagger the working day, keep canteens closed and have red and blue teams working different days.However, a YouGov poll for The Sunday Times shows that just one in four adults would feel safe at work and, by 47% to 28%, people oppose the reopening of schools in the next few weeks.A senior government source said: ""The plan is to get the maximum economic return without raising infection rates. We will lift together but if you suddenly get a particular nightmare in one area you intervene to lock down harder.""Doctors, academics, politicians, charities and celebrities called on the government not to treat the over-70s differently from the rest of the population.Martin Marshall, chairman of the Royal College of GPs, warned that prolonged lockdown would ""impact"" the ""physical and mental health"" of the over-70s and that age alone was not the best way to decide ""who should self-isolate and to what extent during the next stage of lockdown"".He said: ""GPs are finding that many patients who are currently 'shielding' are expressing concern about their ability to continue extreme isolation for a long period, and this needs to be taken into account as plans for how the lockdown will continue are formulated.""Baroness Altmann, former pensions minister and business champion for older workers, is leading the rebellion within the Conservative Party. She said: ""A lot of people have been emailing MPs and ministers and the prime minister expressing outrage. There may be a battle raging in the heart of government on how to deal with this dreadfully difficult issue there are some, I fear, pushing for an age-based lockdown.""Eileen Burns, past president of the British Geriatrics Society, said that while there was a case for frail older people to be shielded for longer, those who were free of any underlying health conditions might not be prepared to sacrifice ""one of the precious years they have left on the off-chance that might mean they don't pick up the virus"".Sir Muir Gray, consultant in public health for the NHS and professor of primary healthcare at Oxford University, warned that a prolonged lockdown could create medical problems for the elderly, through ""deconditioning syndrome"".He said: ""If there's a reduction in activity - physical, cognitive and emotional - that will adversely impact people starting now, but also continuing after lockdown and increasing the risk of dementia and frailty.""Lord Gus O'Donnell, former cabinet secretary and behavioural economist, said: ""I see no reason to lock down over-70s for longer on the grounds of stopping them passing the virus on to others.""If we were imposing rules based entirely on personal risk then we would be tougher on men, ethnic minorities, non-smokers, and those with relevant other health problems.""Sir Ranulph Fiennes, 76, the explorer, also adds his voice to the chorus of disapproval among the over-70s. ""If they do arbitrarily say that over-70s will forcibly be treated differently to others rather than advised of this, I would certainly risk being shoved in a prison lockdown rather than a home lockdown,"" he said. ""This thing, which we're talking about now, is very, very un-British.""Caroline Abrahams, charity director of Age UK, warned that isolation was already taking its toll on the elderly: ""We are hearing some heart-rending stories from people who are desperately alone and already at the end of their tether as a result of the lockdown.""However, the economist and behavioural scientist Andrew Oswald warned that older people had no idea of the danger they are in. Oswald, a professor at the University of Warwick, said: ""Well over 1,000 people have died in this country with no underlying health conditions.""According to a paper he co-wrote, if the government pursues a general exit strategy, fatalities among 70-year-olds would be 75 times higher than for 20-year-olds; for 60 year-olds they would be 50 times as great and for 50 year-olds they would be 20 times higher.The YouGov poll found that 57% think that the over-70s and vulnerable people should continue to self-isolate once the lockdown is over.At a Downing Street press conference, Robert Jenrick, the communities secretary, said ministers would step up efforts to help the elderly and vulnerable trapped at home, but did not say they would soon be let out.He said: ""It's very difficult for people who we have asked to stay at home. We want to offer them the hope that we can return to normality. We are going to do everything we can to support them.""It comes as the government has said more than half the country will need to download a coronavirus tracking app for it to stay on top of outbreaks going forward.Grant Shapps, the transport secretary, said in two or three weeks there would be ""a huge national effort"" to encourage everyone to use the app, suggesting the government would frame downloading it as a duty to the NHS.All travellers arriving in Britain will be required to download the app before being allowed into the country, he suggested.An NHS smartphone app that uses Bluetooth to log which other phones someone has recently been near is being developed as a key part of a contact tracing system that has become critical to relaxing lockdown. Someone who gets a positive test enters this on the app, which then automatically alerts other users they have been close to, without officials needing to know who they are.Speaking on Sophy Ridge on Sunday on Sky News Mr Shapps said: ""That system is going into testing this week on the Isle of Wight and then later in the month that app will be rolled out and deployed, assuming the tests are successful of course, to the population at large. The idea is that we will encourage as many people to take this up as possible, this is going to be a huge national effort. We need for this to work, 50, 60% of people to be using this app.""He acknowledged that not everyone had a smartphone but said that for those who did ""it will be the best possible way to help the NHS"" adding: ""On a Thursday night when people are going out and clapping in future, the ability to do something else of use - which will be to download that app in future - will be a great way to support the NHS.""Acknowledging the centrality of the app to the government's plans, he called it ""a fantastic way to be able to ensure that we are able to really keep a lid on this going forward and that we don't get that second wave.""In some Asian countries which use similar tracking systems, authorities have a right to see data on people's movements to make it easier to find contacts, but Mr Shapps said: ""It will be completely confidential, the information doesn't stay on there, you don't know who the individuals are, but what it would do is alert people if they have been near somebody who later is diagnosed as having coronavirus.""Asked about plans to stop travellers importing coronavirus into the country as flights resume, Mr Shapps said it would be ""wrong"" not to make similar demands on those arriving in Britain.""We could be, for example, asking everybody who comes here to be required to have that app and the same rules apply to anyone visiting which is to stay locked down effectively. The same social distance rules clearly would need to apply to everybody under those circumstances,"" he said.In other developments:● Ministers announced a £76m fund to help victims of domestic violence, which has risen as a result of lockdown● Jenrick said the government was considering requests for help from struggling airlines● Government scientists are investigating whether Britain's high death toll is the result of the obesity crisis after it emerged that the proportion of severely obese patients in intensive care with CV-19 is twice the proportion of severely obese people in the general population.

495,The British charlatan style has been sent packing by too much reality;Boris Johnson has trumpeted jingoism in the face of the coronavirus facts Coronavirus latest updates See all our coronavirus coverage,"May 2, 2020 Saturday",International,The Observer (London),991,991,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,Nick Cohen,The British charlatan style has been sent packing by too much realityBoris Johnson has trumpeted jingoism in the face of the coronavirus facts Coronavirus latest updates See all our coronavirus coverage,"At the time of writing, we have 27,510 corpses - and rising. GDP is 30% down - and falling. We have            lost 950,000 jobs - and there are more to go. We are 37% short of            full personal protection equipment for doctors. We are runners-up in the race to have the highest Covid-19 death toll in Europe and may soon            leapfrog the Italians and claim the title outright. In short, we are a country that has been put to the test - and seen its leaders fail.As they were bound to fail. From the moment Boris Johnson, Nigel Farage and Michael Gove won the Brexit referendum in 2016 by promising we could inflict a shuddering change to our country without feeling pain, failure has been inevitable. The only wonder is that it has taken so long for the British charlatan style to die.It's dying now as surely as the lost souls in care homes disappearing out of sight and out of mind. I say British rather than English because Alex Salmond's promises of Scottish independence without tears anticipated Johnson's promises of a painless Brexit and because British dishonesty takes a distinctive form.Since 2016, Johnson has been a postmodern populist. His myths have been cheerful, a world away from the menace behind Trump's snarls. He claimed the impossible was possible with a wink to the camera and a smirk on his face. He believed, or seemed to believe, you could never be sure, that all difficulties could be overcome with a dose of British pluck.Good government in these circumstances would have been next to impossible. Now the pandemic has hit, it is impossible. Everyone involved in the fatal failure to contain the virus in February and early March is covering their backs. You do not, however, need to stare too hard at Johnson's belated statement on 21 March that ""we're taking away the ancient, inalienable right of free-born people of the United Kingdom to go to the pub"" to know that the ideology of the Brexiters is out of time. Johnson did not act until the pandemic had engulfed us because his puffed-up nationalism held that the Brits, so favoured by providence, would refuse to imitate the cowed continentals. We stood alone in 1940. We stood up for ourselves in the Brexit referendum. Why couldn't we stand at the bar now?Behavioural ""science"", a dubious discipline, since human behaviour does not follow paths as predictable as Newtonian physics, provided a pseudo-intellectual veneer to cover nationalist self-regard. Ministers and their scientific advisers tarried because they thought freeborn Britons would tire of the lockdown. ""There is a risk if we go too early people will understandably get fatigued and it will be difficult to sustain,"" said Chris Whitty, the chief medical officer, on 9 March. In fact, the British were locking themselves down days before the government finally accepted the realities of the pandemic. We did so because one aspect of human behaviour remains predictable: we don't want to die. Far from suffering from lockdown fatigue,            every survey shows that an alarmed public is not straining to ""get back to normal"".Invocations of the wartime spirit, so characteristic of Brexiters who have never fought a war, led to the dallying with the possibility of ""herd immunity"". Britain could take the Blitz, so it could take the virus. Meanwhile, the love of simplistic slogans and over-promising so characteristic of the Brexit movement has been displayed to the point of tedium.Yet the practicalities best explain why, in the words of Professor Chris Grey, one of the best chroniclers of our decline, a Brexit movement ""impervious to reason and incapable of engaging with complexity"" has reached its terminus. Millions of Britons must have gazed on the cabinet and thought, ""really, Tories, is that your best shot?"" They should remember that Johnson destroyed the careers of            Alistair Burt, David Gauke, Justine Greening, Dominic Grieve, Philip Hammond, Ed Vaizey and many another Conservatives with ministerial experience because they wouldn't inflict a no-deal Brexit on Britain.He sent others to the backbenches. Jeremy Hunt, for example, was health secretary for six years and you can wonder why he isn't helping out now. Then you remember he challenged Johnson for the Tory leadership and so had to be punished. I am not asking you to like the Conservative politicians Johnson pushed aside, only to accept that the emergency demands the services of ministers who know how government works. Instead, we have a dilettante PM, a cabinet of nobodies and a civil service policed by Vote Leave propagandists, who can fool the country in a referendum but have no idea how to manage it in a crisis. An administration of all the sycophants rather than all the talents.Its time has gone. I am not saying we are about to enter a better age of competent government. Hard times are rarely good times for the centre left and it looks as if we are heading into the hardest of times. Angry people cling to what they have in a slump. They blame foreigners and turn to shop-soiled saviours. Who knows, after populism with a smirk on its face could come populism with the authentic snarl. What's over is the glib, deceitful spirit of 2016 with its false promise that bills need never be paid. The Brexit right has attempted a final rally. It dismissed warnings about public health as ""over the top"" just as it dismissed warnings about Brexit as ""Project Fear"" and assured us that            ""German carmakers"" or some other knight on a shining unicorn would make everything all right.But the exhausted Johnson has stopped listening to his old allies. Even he knows that Britain will pay for being one of the last European countries to go into lockdown by being among the last to leave. There are many reasons why yesterday's retailers of counterfeit optimism have become today's frightened pessimists. To be precise, 27,510 reasons - and rising.

496,"Don't patronise the over-70s, Boris. There's life in us yet","May 2, 2020 Saturday",International,The Independent (United Kingdom),1215,1215,England & Wales,JANET STREET-PORTER,"Don't patronise the over-70s, Boris. There's life in us yet","According to Dame Joan Bakewell, the government must stop treating the elderly ""like a crazy old people's club"". Boris Johnson promises plans for easing lockdown will be announced next week, but there's no light at the end of his Alpine tunnel for my generation.Some doctors and scientists are calling for the over-70s to isolate for months to come until a Covid-19 vaccine is available - possibly the end of this year or even 2021. Meanwhile, any healthy pensioner who dares to express the desire to go back to work or leave home and meet much-missed family members is shouted down by a mob on social media, demonised for ""placing the NHS at risk"".But is this true? Among those who have suffered the most during this pandemic are the overweight, smokers, people with lung conditions and existing medical conditions. Yes, those over 70 are more likely to be vulnerable, but not all - look at legendary Colonel Tom Moore (100) and Jeremy Corbyn (70) who attended prime minister's questions this week rather than sitting at home.We are witnessing the horrible rise of age discrimination, brought about by fear and misinformation. Don't make healthy baby boomers (and older people) pay the price for our government's mismanagement of this crisis. It is ministers who approved entering lockdown two weeks too late, are failing to organise testing quickly enough and continuing to allow planes to bring thousands of visitors to the UK every day without checking their symptoms.I beg the prime minister to offer a phased return to normality which is fair for everyone, not just the young - and cut the waffle about meadows and mountains. Joan Bakewell is a Labour peer, a former government advocate for older people, and at 87, she's still a prolific writer and broadcaster. Listen to her frustration on Christopher Hope's Chopper's Politics podcast on Friday claiming that politicians stupidly assume everyone over 70 has the same mental and physical characteristics and leads the same kind of lives, whereas there's just as many differences for the generations aged between 30 and 60.If you're 70, you could be like Colonel Tom and expect another thirty years of active life. In your thirties and middle age there will be obese people, fit people, active people and loafers. There will be workers and those who stay at home. So why do politicians continually patronise pensioners?This cabinet is the youngest since 1945, with an average age of 47.8 - at 55, Boris is the third eldest member - and our chancellor is just 39. Boris might have a fiancee over two decades his junior and a new baby to keep him in touch with ""youth"", but does he really understand how people over 70 feel?The signs are not good. To end lockdown in a phased manner he must bring together people of every generation, involve behavioural scientists and psychologists as well as medics and scientists. Older people have a wealth of life experience, are capable of making informed decisions about what risks to take with their health, but now they're being treated like children.When Dame Joan said on The One Show this week that (after 50 days of solitude) she invited a friend to tea in her garden (and they stood the proscribed distance apart), there was outrage from some viewers. There is little risk to standing two metres apart in a supermarket queue, so what's wrong with a cup of tea in a garden?Now, ITV boss Kevin Lygo has said that older actors cannot return to work in soaps like Coronation Street - because he fears for the health of Ken Barlow. I have been told by ITV that I cannot go back to work into the studio for the same reason, which is ridiculous when I see overweight smokers a couple of generations younger given the go-ahead. Is it because of misguided insurance advice?Once again, older people are being linked to the P-word - problem. Wouldn't it be handy for everyone if we spent the rest of our lives digging our gardens, talking to the dog and pottering about dusting, instead of demanding we can return to work and denying young people a slot in the workplace - the same younger people who are pretending lockdown doesn't apply to them.The reason why care homes are suffering so terribly is because this government didn't make them a priority quickly enough and allowed residents to be discharged from hospitals without being tested. Age discrimination at worse, thoughtlessness at the very least.One way back to normality is to introduce medical passports for all age groups, which would be mandatory for anyone over 70. These passports could require weekly testing, a healthy weight, no smoking, and a lack of existing medical conditions which might make the bearer vulnerable. If I pass all these tests, then why can't I go back to work as the lockdown eases?The current policy of issuing endless death statistics and infection rates has produced widespread fear. Scientists are cautious and do not radiate optimism. The prime minister tries to exude positivity, but doesn't offer detail. The net result of the government's approach has been a surge in anxiety and negativity. A new poll shows that - even if lockdown ended - 60 per cent of the public now fear going to bars and restaurants, using public transport, or attending sporting events. More worrying, 40 per cent are scared of going to the shops and sending their children back to school. A third are worried about going out at all.According to one expert, people need to ask themselves ""before the virus, was I worried about dying this year?"" If the answer is no, then they should not be so worried about contracting it. The government's big message - stay at home an stay safe - might have been successful but it has engendered disproportionate anxiety. That consequence is going to require careful risk management if the economy is ever going to restart.Older people have decades of managing risk and evaluating life choices, so don't deny us the right to remain useful and productive members of society.

499,"Isolation as dangerous as smoking 15 cigarettes a day, lockdown adviser warns;Prof Stephen Reicher says that social distancing is having an impact on the nation's mental and physical health","May 2, 2020 Saturday",International,telegraph.co.uk,540,540,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,By Hayley Dixon,"Isolation as dangerous as smoking 15 cigarettes a day, lockdown adviser warnsProf Stephen Reicher says that social distancing is having an impact on the nation's mental and physical health","Social isolation is as damaging to your health as smoking 15 cigarettes a day, an academic advising the Government on lockdown has warned.As the nation remains cut off from family and friends, fears are growing over the physical and psychological impact of stringent social distancing measures.Studies have found that being isolated can increase your risk of death by up to 30 per cent, similar to the impacts of obesity or smoking.Professor Stephen Reicher, who is part of a group of behavioural scientists advising the Government, told The Telegraph: ""The problem with lockdown is isolation; being cut off from people is bad for you psychologically and physically. It is the equivalent of smoking 15 cigarettes a day.""Human beings are social animals. Being connected is remarkably important not just for your mental health but for your physical health.""The Professor of Social Psychology at the University of St Andrews said that as distancing measures are needed to prevent the spread of the virus, it is important for people to find other ways to communicate such as video calling which has seen a surge in popularity.However, surveys by the Office of National Statistics have shown that whilst online communication is the most common coping method, levels of loneliness are still rising whilst households are banned from mixing.A 2015 study by researchers from Brigham Young University in the US previously found that ""substantial evidence now indicates that individuals lacking social connections (both objective and subjective social isolation) are at risk for premature mortality"".It warned that the risk seemed to be higher among the under-65s.Studies have found that social isolation can lead to symptoms associated with the development of cardiovascular disease and can cause sleeplessness, high blood pressure and reduced immune functioning.There are also links between social isolation and a lack of exercise, it has been found. The details have emerged as the Government warns thatit is still too soon to consider lifting the lockdown amid fears of a second peak of coronavirus.Meanwhile, rates of anxiety and depression are rising as people are increasingly concerned about the state of their mental health.Prof Reicher said that from the data he has seen the ""overwhelming story [of lockdown] is still how high the levels of adherence are and how positive relations between people are. Support in the community has been far higher than expected.""However, he said that there ""has been some evidence"" that some people are beginning to break the rules.Prof Reicher said: ""When we see changes in adherence or non-adherence it is not at all clear that this is not a psychological issue, it is much more an issue of practicality.""If you look at the most affluent and the least affluent then you will see that if people can afford to stay at home then they will, if they need to put food on the table then they will go out.""So if there is a problem it is not with psychological fragility but an issue of practicality.""He said that for this reason the Government needed to ""enable rather than enforce"" the lockdown and should help in providing ways in which people can afford to stay at home and communicate with one another online.

500,"How long will the UK coronavirus lockdown last?;Dominic Raab has extended UK lockdown for a further three weeks and said restrictions will not be lifted until changes can be ""safely"" made","May 2, 2020 Saturday",International,telegraph.co.uk,1101,1101,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,"By Sarah Knapton, Science Editor","How long will the UK coronavirus lockdown last?Dominic Raab has extended UK lockdown for a further three weeks and said restrictions will not be lifted until changes can be ""safely"" made","The Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab has extended UK lockdown measures for a further three weeks to prevent the spread of            Covid-19. The announcement on Thursday 16 April came hours after Mr Raab chaired a Cobra meeting to discuss the current social restrictions in place.The extension has been put in place for ""at least"" three weeks which will take the UK to May 7, when we can expect a second review.Mr Raab, who deputised for Boris Johnson, said the Government was being ""as open as we responsibly can at this stage"". ""It would not be responsible to prejudge the evidence that Sage will have and review in just a few weeks' time.""The Foreign Secretary said the Government carefully followed what is happening in other countries but ""we've got to do what is right for the British people based on the advice of our experts, grounded in the conditions prevailing here in the UK"".He said that measures put in place had been successful but that SAGE said that some settings were still seeing infections spreading.He warned that relaxing social restrictions now would damage economy in the longterm.•: How other countries are ending lockdown                     Is lockdown working?                     Less than 12 hours after the Prime Minister's historic address to the nation on March 23, the London Underground was jammed with commuters (see video below), while builders were seen eating together in communal canteens, making a mockery of the Government's rule that no more than two people can gather together in public.Professor Susan Michie, Director of the University College London's Centre for Behaviour Change, warned that some people would simply not be able to carry out the measures, even if they wanted to.""Five million self-employed people are being left potentially destitute by the Government failing to offer financial supportas they have done for directly employed workers,"" she said. ""Since [statutory sick pay of] £94 is not enough to pay rent, bills, food for a family etc, they will be forced to carry on as usual.""The British Transport Police is now on hand to make sure only            critical workers are using the London Underground. But such an inauspicious start to the lockdown suggests the virus will spread further than it would have, had stricter measures been implemented earlier,            as they have in other countries. And it means that the measures we do have are likely to be in place for longer to ""flatten the curve"" in a way that would prevent a second dangerous peak.In addition, on April 1 the Government revealed figures that suggested the lockdown was starting to fray as data showed an ""uptick""            in the number of people using transport.The number of those using their cars and public transport, which had been consistently dropping since strict social distancing measures were introduced, rose for the first time.It is feared that sunny weather will prompt more people to break the rules and go outside to socialise as boredom kicks in.•: Can I go for a drive during lockdown?How long will lockdown last?Mr Raab said the Government needed to be satisfied of five things before it would consider it safe to adjust any of the current measures:•Protect the NHS's ability to cope and be confident that the NHS is able to provide sufficient critical care across the UK.•See a sustained and consistent fall in daily death rates to be confident the UK is beyond the peak.•Reliable data from Sage showing rate of infection is decreasing to manageable levels across the board.•Confident that testing capacity and PPE are in hand with supply able to meet future demand.•Confident that any adjustments to the current measures would not risk a second peak in infections which would overwhelm the NHS.When the lockdown was first announced, Professor Mark Woolhouse, Professor of Infectious Disease Epidemiology, University of Edinburgh, said: ""We now enter a phase of careful monitoring. We are looking for indicators first that the epidemic is slowing down and then for numbers of new cases to start to fall. ""After three weeks we will have to decide whether the restrictions need to be continued, can be relaxed, or can be relaxed temporarily with the expectation of imposing them again later. ""We must also monitor the damage that the lockdown is doing; damage to the economy, to education, to psychological well-being and to health and social care provision in the community. The impacts of this epidemic are too far reaching for policy decisions to be driven by epidemiology alone.""Professor Sheila Bird said that more cases in coming weeks would make it easier for the Government to predict how the epidemic is responding to lockdown measures, which will inform how long they remain in place. ""Once an epidemic takes hold, as now in UK, the country's own data - properly reported and interpreted - take precedence over modelling as the data tell us the actual toll which the epidemic is exacting,"" she said.""A huge amount can be inferred about the immediately forthcoming weeks from these data directly, including whether further policy changes are needed to reinforce social-distancing; for example in particular age groups.""Some experts are still concerned that the current restrictions do not go far enough while others say the government has been hit by an ""epidemic of action"", and is now bringing in measures that have little rationale. Professor Robert Dingwall, Professor of Sociology, at Nottingham Trent University, wrote in The Telegraph: ""It is another triumph of populism over science, of a capitulation to the demand to 'do something'. ""We are still seeing some notion that 'the people' are selfish and must be bullied and disciplined. ""The people are not selfish; they have behaved in ways that are individually rational but have collectively irrational results.""However Dr Andrea Collins, Senior Clinical Lecturer in Respiratory Medicine at the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine (LSTM), said: ""I believe that they have not quite gone far enough. The 'absolutely' necessary to go to work is still being used by some when it is not required-I think we need permits across controlled areas to go to a workplace.""Recent modelling from the universities of Exeter, Bristol and Warwick suggested that without any measures at all, the epidemic would have peaked around 133 days after first person-to-person transmission in Britain, which happened around February 28. So the lockdown has the potential of curtailing the spread by around seven weeks. A welcome relief for people who could have been facing lockdown for most of the summer.",Newspaper; Web Publication
501,"Set free healthy over-seventies, say doctors;Wholesale lockdown of old is 'discriminatory'Doctors back calls to free over-70s","May 3, 2020 Sunday",International,The Sunday Times (London),1295,1295,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,Caroline Wheeler,"Set free healthy over-seventies, say doctorsWholesale lockdown of old is 'discriminatory'Doctors back calls to free over-70s","Correction: Our report ""Set free healthy over-seventies, say doctors"" (News, last week) referred to 1.8 million people classified as ""clinically vulnerable"" to Covid-19. In fact this group is officially categorised as ""clinically extremely vulnerable"". We apologise for the error.Lockdown should be eased for the healthy over-70s because keeping them inside is damaging their mental health, senior doctors warned Boris Johnson last night.The British Medical Association (BMA) and the Royal College of GPs intervened to say that age alone should not determine people's ability to go about their daily lives when the government begins easing the lockdown restrictions. About 1.8 million ""clinically vulnerable people"" have been warned that they must stay in lockdown for at least 12 weeks, with some ministers saying they might need to remain at home until there is a vaccine, which could take a year or more.They include people ""aged 70 or older regardless of medical conditions"" and those ""under 70 with an underlying health condition"".But in a statement, the BMA said: ""A blanket ban on any section of the population being prohibited from lockdown easing would be discriminatory and unacceptable.""The doctor's union said the government should ensure that ""those at highest risk from infection are protected"", but added: ""This needs to be based on individual risk that would apply at all ages rather than an arbitrary age of 60 or 70.""Last night, Johnson's father, Stanley, urged him to end restrictions in time for his 80th birthday in August when he hopes to climb Mount Kilimanjaro to raise money for the Save the Asian Elephant charity. ""I am rather hoping they will ease the restrictions in time,"" he said.As the death toll rose yesterday to 28,131 - a rise of 621 - the prime minister summoned ministers and aides to Downing Street to thrash out a ""whack-a-mole"" exit strategy, which he is due to publish on Thursday. Under the plans, he will unveil a slow easing of the lockdown but warn that where virus ""hotspots"" erupt, a tougher localised lockdown could be imposed. Officials will only tweak the lockdown this week, encouraging building sites to reopen, relaxing rules on outdoor activities, urging people to cover their faces on public transport and key workers to put their children back in school.Businesses will be given three weeks to prepare work spaces so people can remain socially distanced. Johnson will then lay out proposals to make bigger changes at the end of May. They will see pupils who have key tests or exams next year (Sats, GCSEs and A-levels), return to school, and more retailers, such as garden centres, reopen. Office workers will be told to stagger the working day, keep canteens closed and have a red and blue teams working different days.However, a YouGov poll for The Sunday Times shows that just one in four adults would feel safe at work and, by 47% to 28%, people oppose the reopening of schools in the next few weeks.A senior government source Continued on page 2 ?HOTSPOTS SET FOR A WHACKING PAGE 9 ? Continued from page 2 said: ""The plan is to get the maximum economic return without raising infection rates. We will lift together but if you suddenly get a particular nightmare in one area you intervene to lock down harder.""Doctors, academics, politicians, charities and celebrities called on the government not to treat the over-70s differently from the rest of the population.Martin Marshall, chairman of the Royal College of GPs, warned that prolonged lockdown would ""impact"" the ""physical and mental health"" of the over-70s and that age alone was not the best way to decide ""who should self-isolate and to what extent during the next stage of lockdown"".He said: ""GPs are finding that many patients who are currently 'shielding' are expressing concern about their ability to continue extreme isolation for a long period, and this needs to be taken into account as plans for how the lockdown will continue are formulated.""Baroness Ros Altmann, former pensions minister and business champion for older workers, is leading the rebellion within the Conservative Party. She said: ""A lot of people have been emailing MPs and ministers and the prime minister expressing outrage. There may be a battle raging in the heart of government on how to deal with this dreadfully difficult issue there are some, I fear, pushing for an agebased lockdown."" Eileen Burns, past president of the British Geriatrics Society, said that while there was a case for frail older people to be shielded for longer, those who were free of any underlying health conditions might not be prepared to sacrifice ""one of the precious years they have left on the off-chance that might mean they don't pick up the virus"".Sir Muir Gray, consultant in public health for the NHS and professor of primary healthcare at Oxford University, warned that a prolonged lockdown could create medical problems for the elderly, through ""deconditioning syndrome"".He said: ""If there's a reduction in activity - physical, cognitive and emotional - that will adversely impact people starting now, but also continuing after lockdown and increasing the risk of dementia and frailty.""Lord Gus O'Donnell, former cabinet secretary and behavioural economist, said: ""I see no reason to lock down over-70s for longer on the grounds of stopping them passing the virus on to others.""If we were imposing rules based entirely on personal risk then we would be tougher on men, ethnic minorities, non-smokers, and those with relevant other health problems.""Sir Ranulph Fiennes, 76, the explorer, also adds his voice to the chorus of disapproval among the over-70s. ""If they do arbitrarily say that over-70s will forcibly be treated differently to others rather than advised of this, I would certainly risk being shoved in a prison lockdown rather than a home lockdown,"" he said.

She quotes him as saying that previous generations, subjected to worse plagues than the coronavirus, ""would not have understood all the fuss"". As a retired QC, may I lend support to Bennett's condemnation. Sumption's exalted status as a retired justice of the supreme court cannot be allowed to blanket out his disregard for the jurisprudence that has evolved in relation to article 2 of the European convention on human rights, which states that ""everyone's right to life shall be protected by law"". To which I would add that Sumption is a lawyer and a historian, not a scientist or an epidemiologist. In this crisis, I rather incline to the view that the advice of the latter professions is what we should heed.Donald MacLeodEdinburghCatherine Bennett writes against easing the lockdown from a position of privilege. The ultimate solution to the crisis lies in either a vaccine or herd immunity. Given that the vaccine is at least a year away, and that herd immunity has been abandoned as a strategy, waves of lockdown look likely to be with us for the next 12 months or so. This might not bother those who can continue to draw a salary (or a pension) while working at home, those who don't suffer from domestic abuse or live alone, those whose mental health hasn't nosedived or who aren't among the 5 million gig economy workers for whom time has now run out.Further afield, Oxfam warns that shutting down economies could plunge more than half a billion people into poverty. How are they to be factored in to the equation that churns out the lockdown answer to the question, what is to be done?Andrew DobsonKeele, Staffs                     Reasons to be cheerful                   Phillip Inman rightly says Nobel prize-winning economist Sir Angus Deaton, Harvard's Amartya Sen and the Bank of England's Andy Haldane offer ""reasons for optimism"" about increased global cooperation after the coronavirus crisis (""It's in all our interests to become a more caring society"", Economics). Likewise, Jared Diamond, Pulitzer prize-winning professor of geography, told BBC2's Newsnight: ""I am cautiously optimistic that what we'll learn from dealing with this problem of moderate importance [Covid-19] will help in dealing with much more important problems"", such as climate change and resource overexploitation.Before the pandemic, Diamond predicted that ""the chances are about 49% that the world as we know it will collapse by about 2050"". Post-coronavirus, he estimates the chances of survival of the planet's present network of civilisation as having gone up from 51% to a still very sobering but improved 58% by 2050.Joe McCarthyDublin                     An honest appraisal                   There is one sense in which Boris Johnson will fail to be honest with the voters (""Will Boris Johnson's brush with death prompt him to talk more honestly?"", Comment). What has to be accepted is that the threat posed by Covid-19 will remain and that living with that will be the new normal. Society and the economy need to be organised so as to minimise the threat. Mass tourism, for example, will no longer be possible and the industry associated with that will disappear.To manage this and other threats to the economy will require government intervention on a scale not seen since the late 1940s. The government will have to limit financial support to those industries that remain viable in a society vulnerable to this virus and be a midwife to those new virus-proof industries that are needed to re-employ those millions left without a job. Can Johnson be honest about the change needed - no - but can any politician be honest with the people in face of such a gloomy prognosis?Derrick JoadLeeds                     Tell, don't nudge                   Sonia Sodha is right to draw attention to the limitations of nudge theory when it comes to most public policy (""Nudge theory cannot replace hard science in matters of life or death"", Comment). There are examples where nudging people to behave in a certain way can work effectively. Flashing speed limit signals tend to slow down speeding drivers, though usually only for a short distance. In the case of tobacco consumption, however, dire warning messages and vivid pictures of diseased lungs on cigarette packages had very little impact on levels of smoking. What was most effective was making it illegal to smoke in public places.When it came to responding to the coronavirus outbreak, nudge theory clearly fitted nicely with Boris Johnson's libertarian and small government prejudices. Sadly, it delayed implementing more effective policies by some two weeks, the consequence of which has been a higher number of deaths than might otherwise have been the case. Sometimes, telling people what to do is necessary.Philip DaviesSteeple Aston, Oxfordshire                     People before profit                   Let me congratulate Kenan Malik for shining a light on the distortion of perspective created by the developed world's concentration on profit, powered by rightwing ideologies (""We're desperate for a cure, but at what cost to the human guinea pigs"" and ""           Heroism is the most human of qualities"", Comment). In the grip of a pandemic that has accounted for about a quarter of a million deaths worldwide, there does not seem to be any equivalent concern over the much higher death rates from very preventable conditions in countries with higher percentages of poor people.The most damning quote came when he highlighted Hélder Câmara's comment about being considered a saint when he distributed food among the poor but castigated as a communist for daring to ask publicly why the poor have no food.

""I believe it's fair to say that while scientists can give advice ... it is governments who have to make political decisions.""You can't hide behind the scientists when you do that, particularly if those of us in the public domain don't know what the scientists were advising because the advisers are not free to come on radio and television and tell us what their advice has been.""King cited the government policy on face masks, which he said appeared to be politically convenient, but ran in contradiction to the best available evidence.""There's plenty of evidence to indicate that the wearing of face masks is a major help in reducing person-to-person viral transfer,"" King said. ""This is why it has become so much a part of the culture in South Asia.""When Austria introduced a requirement to wear face masks in public, the incidence of Covid-19 ""just collapsed around that one piece of advice"", he added.""I wonder whether that decision, apparently by Sage ... was driven by the necessity of not requiring it because we don't have the face masks available in this country,"" said King.""That's a political issue. My advice would always be that face masks are required and that if we don't have them, you need to see we acquire them for the people at large.""The group, which includes a range of leading scientists working across public health, computer modelling, behavioural science and intensive care medicine, aims to present the government with ""robust, unbiased advice"".King argues that the official Sage is compromised by the fact that 16 of the 23 known members of the committee, including the prime minister's strategist Dominic Cummings, are employed by government.The Independent Sage meeting will cover seven areas, including the criteria for lifting lockdown, testing and tracing and quarantine and shielding policies for vulnerable groups. It will formally submit its recommendations to the health and social care select committee, placing pressure on the government to explain the advice behind its lockdown exit strategy, parts of which are expected to be unveiled in the coming week.King said that the biggest potential pitfall in weeks ahead would be to relax lockdown measures too soon and that he believes the government's so-called five tests for whether it is safe to ease restrictions are inadequate.""My own feeling is that the extent to which the virus is still in the population means we are not yet close ... to coming out of lockdown,"" he said. ""Undoubtedly the biggest potential pitfall is removing lockdown too early and too quickly.""A second peak, he said, could not only increase casualties, but could also lengthen the overall period of time before the country is able to fully exit lockdown. ""If you go into a second peak, it just becomes more and more difficult to end the pandemic,"" he added.King previously held the chief scientific role, now occupied by Sir Patrick Vallance, between 2000 and 2007 and served as the UK's climate envoy from 2013 to 2017.The independent advisory group will include some vocal critics of the government's Covid-19 policies, such as the global public health expert Prof Anthony Costello, as well as former and existing Sage experts.",Newspaper
507,Coronavirus diary: I didn't think any of it applied to me - but suddenly it did;John Rentoul looks back at how we came to realise that the world was being turned upside down,"May 3, 2020 Sunday",International,The Independent (United Kingdom),2401,2401,England & Wales,John Rentoul,Coronavirus diary: I didn't think any of it applied to me - but suddenly it didJohn Rentoul looks back at how we came to realise that the world was being turned upside down,"I was woken by the silence. That is when I should have known the world was about to change. Usually, the planes start flying out of London City airport at 6am, but I am so used to them I don't hear them. I mean, I was so used to them I didn't hear them. That morning, 10 March, was before anything had really happened. The government had told us to wash our hands, and some people had stopped shaking each others'. Offices, including The Independent, were getting ready for staff to work from home, although we weren't sure that would be necessary. And people were travelling less, hence the lack of planes. Even so, I didn't think any of it applied to me. It being Tuesday, I went to the House of Commons as normal. I travelled by Tube, and thought nothing of it. I did a day's work and came home. It was the last time I was there. The next day was Budget day. I expected to watch from the press gallery as Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn went through the motions of prime minister's questions - likely to be an even lower-key encounter than usual just before the main event. Then I would be writing about Rishi Sunak's big speech. But the first news of the day was that Nadine Dorries, the junior health minister, had tested positive for the coronavirus. I can do the Budget from home, I thought. It is not as good, because part of the political intelligence about a big event comes from the buzz of ideas and conversations in the press gallery offices. But one of the things about my job is that it is perfectly possible to do it remotely.Sunak's Budget was out of date before he sat down (AFP/Getty)I don't know Dorries, but she is one of the people I might pass on my way to the office. Some of the journalists I work with might have met her recently. Suddenly coronavirus did apply to me. Having half-thought that I'd probably already had it (I think almost everyone did), I now thought I probably hadn't and, although I wasn't worried about my own health (the prime minister had already said that for most people it was mild), I didn't want to spread it, so it was not worth going to the one place I knew where someone definitely had got it. So I watched the Budget speech and wrote about it from home. The chancellor announced £30bn of extra spending, paid for by borrowing, to deal with the effect of coronavirus. At the time it seemed the main economic impact might be that as many as one in five people might have to take time off work. We didn't know it, but by the time Sunak sat down, his Budget was already out of date. The prime minister was preparing to make a dramatic announcement the next day.                      The mayor himself wasn't shaking hands. At the time, this was unusual, especially for a politician, and more especially for one on the lookout for votes                     The previous week I had been to a reception for journalists held by Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London. It is an annual event, although this year it was more important because there was an election coming up. You could tell there was an election coming up because Khan and his staff kept using the phrase ""two-horse race"". I think this was designed to suggest that Rory Stewart, the Tory independent, was a no-hoper trying to break into a contest between Khan and Shaun Bailey, his official Tory opponent. To me, it suggested that Stewart was Khan's real challenger. None of that matters now. The election has been postponed to next year, and looking back it was strange that so many people packed themselves into a tiny space - the mayor holds his parties in what is no more than a corridor in the glass bulb of City Hall with a fine view of Tower Bridge and the City. The mayor himself wasn't shaking hands. At the time, this was unusual, especially for a politician, and more especially for one on the lookout for votes. Khan was told that if Prince Charles offered his hand he should shake it (PA)Khan told me he had just been at an event with Prince Charles, which had raised the question of whether they should shake hands with each other. Khan had consulted his aides, who told him he would have to take the prince's hand if it was offered. It was, and Khan said he was surprised that Charles shook hands with everybody. I remember being surprised that Khan was surprised. Shaking hands with people is, after all, Charles's job. (Three weeks later, Charles tested positive and went into isolation.) Khan's reception was two days after Boris Johnson held his first news conference on coronavirus. He was flanked, for the first time but closer than two metres away, by Professor Chris Whitty and Sir Patrick Vallance, in a room in 10 Downing Street full of journalists. ""I continue to shake hands,"" said the prime minister. In words that would soon become notorious, he tried to sound cheerful and business-as-usual: ""I was at a hospital the other night where I think a few there were actually coronavirus patients and I shook hands with everybody, you'll be pleased to know."" I was at a hospital the other night where I think a few there were actually coronavirus patients and I shook hands with everybody, you'll be pleased to knowBoris JohnsonPeople were free to make up their own minds, he said, and with a nod to his medical and scientific advisers, he added: ""Our judgement is washing your hands is the crucial thing.""We can now see that the period from the election on 12 December until the prime minister's news conference on 12 March, the day after the Budget, was a three-month phoney peace. For political journalists, Brexit was a total war that had lasted three and a half years since the referendum. For all that time there was one story. If it had been plotted by the gods, they laid a false trail that dominated most of the narrative, of Theresa May's doomed attempt to find a compromise acceptable to the EU and to the UK parliament. Then there came the great plot twist, by which Boris Johnson managed, with unexpected help from Jo Swinson and Jeremy Corbyn, to turn his failure to deliver Brexit into an election triumph six weeks later. Our actual departure from the EU, on 31 January, was an anticlimactic epilogue. It happened during the phoney peace, in which I wrote articles with headlines such as: ""Keir Starmer is likely to win the Labour leadership race, because politics is returning to boring normal.""I usually keep a short list of ideas for possible articles. In the week of the Budget, I had three items on it: David Frost, the prime minister's EU negotiator, who seems an interesting person (someone had just told me he was a keen Labour supporter at university); another attempt to explain why Heathrow expansion would (and should) never happen; and something on Corbyn's view of party democracy, which didn't extend to bringing back elections to the shadow cabinet. After the intensity of the Brexit years, it seemed as if politics had returned to some kind of normality. I thought I might even have time to go to the dentist. Although I had already been woken by the sound of no planes, and although I had already decided to work from home for the time being, the prime minister's news conference on Thursday 12 March came as a profound shock. Again flanked by Whitty and Vallance, Johnson said: ""I must level with you, I must level with the British public. Many more families are going to lose loved ones before their time.""He announced that the government was moving from trying to contain the virus to trying to delay its spread. He said that anyone showing the symptoms should stay at home for seven days, and that the aim was to ""squash the sombrero"" of the graph showing the peak of infections. The government was ""considering"" banning big sports events, but thought that closing schools could ""do more harm than good at this time"". In hindsight, the measures seem remarkably tentative. The prime minister concluded: ""Don't forget, wash your hands and we will get through this."" At the time, though, it was a lurch into a new, all-consuming single news story. The first two questions from journalists were ""How sure are you that the approach is right?"" and ""How many will die?""After that, I wrote about almost nothing else in my political commentary. Even articles about Keir Starmer's election as Labour leader were focused on the strange times in which he was to take over. I wrote up a class given by Tony Blair to our students at King's College London before the shutters came down - and he was asked a couple of questions about the impending crisis. Only my sidelines of pedantry (the            Mea Culpa column) and trivia (the weekly            Top 10s) kept me from monomania. Johnson flanked by Whitty and Vallance before the two-metre rule (PA)The first 11 days seemed to bring unprecedented escalation in the crisis every day. On Monday 16 March Johnson asked people to avoid social contact, imposing what was later described as a ""voluntary lockdown"": he urged people not to go to the pub and advised against inessential travel. On 18 March, he was asked about legislating to require people to stay at home and said: ""We live in a land of liberty ... We don't tend to impose those sorts of restrictions on people in this country. But I have to tell you we will rule nothing out."" Two days later, the schools closed. Meanwhile, the chancellor rewrote his Budget twice, first announcing 10 times as much unfunded public spending as in the Budget itself, and then unlimited sums on paying 80 per cent of people's wages and bailing out companies. On Monday 23 March, we entered the dreamlike state of full lockdown. The prime minister addressed the nation and said: ""We will stop all gatherings of more than two people in public."" People were required to stay at home and shops selling non-essential goods were closed. Since then, time has seemed to stand still. I recount all this because I think it is important to remember how little we knew when this started, and to try to counter hindsight-based interpretations of what the government should have done. At the time, Johnson appeared sometimes to be lagging behind public opinion. When he was asked on 12 March how sure he was his approach was right, the question meant: why aren't you imposing a full lockdown as they are doing in other countries? But he was following the advice of the experts, which is why they were standing next to him. Whitty, the chief medical officer, answered the question by saying that behavioural science shows that ""if you start too early, and then people's enthusiasm runs out just about the peak, which is exactly the time that we want people to be doing these interventions, that is not a productive way to do it; so we want people to do it at the last point that is reasonable, so that people maintain their energy and enthusiasm"".Since then, and despite time standing still, much has happened. It was only three days after telling people not to leave their homes that Johnson and Matt Hancock, the health secretary, tested positive for the virus. Then came the drama early last month when the prime minister was admitted to hospital, and moved to intensive care ""as a precaution"" the next day. Followed, three days later, by the ratcheting down of the narrative tension with his move out of intensive care and, after another three days, his discharge to Chequers - the prime minister's country residence, which also featured prominently in the previous total-immersion news story as the setting for the cabinet split over Theresa May's Brexit compromise. Johnson's video address to the nation, recorded at Chequers on 12 April, was a minor masterpiece of leadership by empathy, praising the NHS and the immigrant nurses who had looked after him and trying to embody, by his vigour and his combination of seriousness and optimism, the Churchillian spirit of KBO. And then we waited. We wondered at the resilience of the national broadband network, which allowed everyone to watch videos, including of each other, all the time. Experts disputed on social media whether Netflix and YouTube needed to downgrade their entertainments from high definition to standard, but the rest of us were pleasantly surprised that the internet had not collapsed. On the bright side, lockdown has given us quiet streets, cleaner air and more audible birdsong (EPA)We noted, too, that the food industry responded quickly to changing patterns of demand, with only strong bread flour for bread makers still in short supply. We learned about ourselves and the surprising things we enjoy about enforced isolation: the silence, the empty roads, the people being kind to each other and politely acknowledging the etiquette of social distance in public places. The things we miss about the office, or, in my case, both my offices - the idle chat in the press gallery offices in parliament or at Independent headquarters in Kensington.We learned a lot more about the virus, and a lot more about how much we still don't know. There is a large and strident group of people on Twitter who are convinced that the government should have ignored Whitty's advice and shut the country down sooner. (Spending most of my time on Twitter is something that hasn't changed in lockdown.) But it is also possible that we will end up discovering that many aspects of the lockdown didn't make much difference to the spread of the virus. One thing some people are very sure about is that we weren't ready. At least, they are very sure about that now. I want to listen only to the ones who knew in January what we weren't ready for. For a while after the prime minister told us many of our loved ones would die we thought we needed ventilators, and for a few days - or it may have been weeks - journalists were intent on asking questions about how many we had, how many were coming and why they hadn't been ordered months ago. Then it turned out that we didn't need so many ventilators and that we wanted medical gowns and testing kits. And we still don't know if face masks make a significant difference or not. Like most people, I find it hard to accept that some things are not known. Instead of my list of possible articles, I now have a list of questions about the virus and about the economics of recovering from the pandemic recession. I try to find answers, but I try also to reconcile myself to uncertainty.Meanwhile, I enjoy the quiet, the empty streets, the absence of planes, and the birdsong. ",Newspaper; Web Publication
508,Isolation 'as harmful as a 15-a-day smoking habit',"May 3, 2020",International,The Sunday Telegraph (London),379,379,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,Hayley Dixon,Isolation 'as harmful as a 15-a-day smoking habit',"SOCIAL isolation is as damaging to your health as smoking 15 cigarettes a day, an academic advising the Government on lockdown has warned. As the nation remains cut off from family and friends, fears are growing over the physical and psychological impact of stringent social distancing measures. Studies have found that being isolated can increase your risk of death by up to 30 per cent, similar to the impacts from obesity or smoking.Prof Stephen Reicher, who is part of a group of behavioural scientists advising the Government, said: ""The problem with lockdown is isolation; being cut off from people is bad for you psychologically and physically. It is the equivalent of smoking 15 cigarettes a day. Human beings are social animals. Being connected is remarkably important not just for your mental health but for your physical health.""The professor of social psychology at the University of St Andrews said that, as distancing measures are needed to prevent the spread of the virus, it is important for people to find other ways to communicate, such as video calling, which has seen a surge in popularity.However, surveys by the Office of National Statistics have shown that, while online communication is the most common coping method, levels of loneliness are still rising while households are banned from mixing.In 2015, researchers from Brigham Young University in the US found that ""substantial evidence now indicates that individuals lacking social connections (both objective and subjective social isolation) are at risk for premature mortality"".Studies have found that social isolation can lead to symptoms associated with the development of cardiovascular disease and can cause sleeplessness, high blood pressure and reduced immune functioning. There are also links between social isolation and a lack of exercise, it has been found.Meanwhile, rates of anxiety and depression are rising under lockdown as people are increasingly concerned about the state of their mental health.Prof Reicher said that from the data he had seen the ""overwhelming story [of lockdown] is still how high the levels of adherence are and how positive relations between people are"".'Being cut off from people is bad for you psychologically and physically.

Now that normal weather has resumed, we're desperate to revert to normal everything else.A few rules will be officially relaxed but increasingly people will make the restrictions work for themselves.

510,"How long will the UK coronavirus lockdown last?;Dominic Raab has extended UK lockdown for a further three weeks and said restrictions will not be lifted until changes can be ""safely"" made","May 3, 2020 Sunday",International,telegraph.co.uk,1101,1101,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,"By Sarah Knapton, Science Editor","How long will the UK coronavirus lockdown last?Dominic Raab has extended UK lockdown for a further three weeks and said restrictions will not be lifted until changes can be ""safely"" made","The Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab has extended UK lockdown measures for a further three weeks to prevent the spread of            Covid-19. The announcement on Thursday 16 April came hours after Mr Raab chaired a Cobra meeting to discuss the current social restrictions in place.The extension has been put in place for ""at least"" three weeks which will take the UK to May 7, when we can expect a second review.Mr Raab, who deputised for Boris Johnson, said the Government was being ""as open as we responsibly can at this stage"". ""It would not be responsible to prejudge the evidence that Sage will have and review in just a few weeks' time.""The Foreign Secretary said the Government carefully followed what is happening in other countries but ""we've got to do what is right for the British people based on the advice of our experts, grounded in the conditions prevailing here in the UK"".He said that measures put in place had been successful but that SAGE said that some settings were still seeing infections spreading.He warned that relaxing social restrictions now would damage economy in the longterm.•: How other countries are ending lockdown                     Is lockdown working?                     Less than 12 hours after the Prime Minister's historic address to the nation on March 23, the London Underground was jammed with commuters (see video below), while builders were seen eating together in communal canteens, making a mockery of the Government's rule that no more than two people can gather together in public.Professor Susan Michie, Director of the University College London's Centre for Behaviour Change, warned that some people would simply not be able to carry out the measures, even if they wanted to.""Five million self-employed people are being left potentially destitute by the Government failing to offer financial supportas they have done for directly employed workers,"" she said. ""Since [statutory sick pay of] £94 is not enough to pay rent, bills, food for a family etc, they will be forced to carry on as usual.""The British Transport Police is now on hand to make sure only            critical workers are using the London Underground. But such an inauspicious start to the lockdown suggests the virus will spread further than it would have, had stricter measures been implemented earlier,            as they have in other countries. And it means that the measures we do have are likely to be in place for longer to ""flatten the curve"" in a way that would prevent a second dangerous peak.In addition, on April 1 the Government revealed figures that suggested the lockdown was starting to fray as data showed an ""uptick""            in the number of people using transport.The number of those using their cars and public transport, which had been consistently dropping since strict social distancing measures were introduced, rose for the first time.It is feared that sunny weather will prompt more people to break the rules and go outside to socialise as boredom kicks in.•: Can I go for a drive during lockdown?How long will lockdown last?Mr Raab said the Government needed to be satisfied of five things before it would consider it safe to adjust any of the current measures:•Protect the NHS's ability to cope and be confident that the NHS is able to provide sufficient critical care across the UK.•See a sustained and consistent fall in daily death rates to be confident the UK is beyond the peak.•Reliable data from Sage showing rate of infection is decreasing to manageable levels across the board.•Confident that testing capacity and PPE are in hand with supply able to meet future demand.•Confident that any adjustments to the current measures would not risk a second peak in infections which would overwhelm the NHS.When the lockdown was first announced, Professor Mark Woolhouse, Professor of Infectious Disease Epidemiology, University of Edinburgh, said: ""We now enter a phase of careful monitoring. We are looking for indicators first that the epidemic is slowing down and then for numbers of new cases to start to fall. ""After three weeks we will have to decide whether the restrictions need to be continued, can be relaxed, or can be relaxed temporarily with the expectation of imposing them again later. ""We must also monitor the damage that the lockdown is doing; damage to the economy, to education, to psychological well-being and to health and social care provision in the community. The impacts of this epidemic are too far reaching for policy decisions to be driven by epidemiology alone.""Professor Sheila Bird said that more cases in coming weeks would make it easier for the Government to predict how the epidemic is responding to lockdown measures, which will inform how long they remain in place. ""Once an epidemic takes hold, as now in UK, the country's own data - properly reported and interpreted - take precedence over modelling as the data tell us the actual toll which the epidemic is exacting,"" she said.""A huge amount can be inferred about the immediately forthcoming weeks from these data directly, including whether further policy changes are needed to reinforce social-distancing; for example in particular age groups.""Some experts are still concerned that the current restrictions do not go far enough while others say the government has been hit by an ""epidemic of action"", and is now bringing in measures that have little rationale. Professor Robert Dingwall, Professor of Sociology, at Nottingham Trent University, wrote in The Telegraph: ""It is another triumph of populism over science, of a capitulation to the demand to 'do something'. ""We are still seeing some notion that 'the people' are selfish and must be bullied and disciplined. ""The people are not selfish; they have behaved in ways that are individually rational but have collectively irrational results.""However Dr Andrea Collins, Senior Clinical Lecturer in Respiratory Medicine at the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine (LSTM), said: ""I believe that they have not quite gone far enough. The 'absolutely' necessary to go to work is still being used by some when it is not required-I think we need permits across controlled areas to go to a workplace.""Recent modelling from the universities of Exeter, Bristol and Warwick suggested that without any measures at all, the epidemic would have peaked around 133 days after first person-to-person transmission in Britain, which happened around February 28. So the lockdown has the potential of curtailing the spread by around seven weeks. A welcome relief for people who could have been facing lockdown for most of the summer.",Newspaper; Web Publication
511,No 10 facing fresh calls for transparency over Sage pandemic advice;Government publishes names of 50 members of experts' group but list is incompleteCoronavirus - latest updatesSee all our coronavirus coverage,"May 4, 2020 Monday",International,The Guardian (London),808,808,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,Ian Sample and Rowena Mason,No 10 facing fresh calls for transparency over Sage pandemic adviceGovernment publishes names of 50 members of experts' group but list is incompleteCoronavirus - latest updatesSee all our coronavirus coverage,"Downing Street is facing fresh calls for transparency about the expert advice it receives after it published the names of 50 experts who sit on the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), which discusses how to handle the coronavirus epidemic.The list of names, which is not complete, was released after critics raised questions about the secrecy of Sage and the Guardian revealed that Boris Johnson's chief political adviser, Dominic Cummings, had played an            active role in Sage meetings.The group's membership and the nature of its advice have come under scrutiny, with critics arguing that Britain has botched key aspects of its pandemic response even as ministers claimed they were following ""the best science"".The list contains the bulk of the Sage membership as well as the names of experts who sit on subgroups that specialise in issues such as outbreak modelling, behavioural science and the spread of infection in schools and hospitals.The list includes 24 instances of people asking for their names not to be made public, though some may be duplicates, as experts can sit on more than one group. Two members of Sage asked not to be named.Sir David King, a former chief scientific adviser, has warned that the purity of the scientific advice reaching the prime minister is being put at risk by the presence of political appointees such as           Cummings. He said publication of the names was ""a good first step"" but not enough to reassure people.""What we want to see is what Sage is discussing, what their advice is, what the advice of the scientists is as distinct from that of the strategy advisers. It's certainly a good step, but there's a lot more to be done,"" he said. On Monday, King convened the first open meeting of an ""independent Sage"" group, with a dozen experts whose names were made public beforehand.Around half of the members of Sage are scientific advisers from government departments, public health officials and senior NHS staff, with the other half coming from universities, the list shows.The members include David Halpern, head of the Cabinet Office's behavioural insights team, or ""nudge unit"", Prof Venki Ramakrishnan, president of the Royal Society, who attends as chair of the society's Data Evaluation and Learning for Viral Epidemics (Delve) Group, and Prof David Spiegelhalter, chair of the Winton Centre for Risk and Evidence Communication at Cambridge University.The government stated that while the meetings were ""regularly attended by officials from Her Majesty's government"", their names were excluded from the publication list, though it did not explain why.The advisory group is co-chaired by Sir Patrick Vallance, the government's chief scientific adviser and Prof Chris Whitty, England's chief medical officer. The names were not made public before, Vallance has said, because of concerns over members' personal security and fears of outside influence.James Wilsdon, digital science professor of research policy at Sheffield University, said publication of the names was ""a welcome step"" adding that ""openness and transparency must now become the default operating mode across the Sage process"".""Too much rests on the interpretation of evidence, dilemmas and uncertainties in this crisis for the process to take place behind closed doors,"" he said. ""We're in a situation of what some call 'post-normal' science, where the facts are uncertain, values are in dispute, stakes are high and decisions are urgent.""We need Sage to respond accordingly, start treating the public as grown-ups, and throw open its workings to wider engagement, debate and scrutiny,"" he added.Philip Bath, professor of stroke medicine at Nottingham University, said: ""It is very important to see who is involved in Sage and its supporting groups so that the public know who is involved, their expertise and whether they are representative of the population in respect of geography and protected characteristics.""He said he was struck by how many of the experts came from the ""golden triangle"" of London, Oxford and Cambridge, and why experts were not drawn from around the UK. He said the list should be improved by naming each expert's ""base speciality"", including for those who did not agree to be named.Derek Hill, an expert in medicine and medical device regulation at University College London, said that given the importance of medical devices in dealing with Covid-19, from personal protective equipment to temperature sensors to ventilators, Sage appeared to lack expertise on medical devices and the regulatory system.""This is very relevant as it impacts the risk associated with implementing some aspects of Sage advice, which should be captured in such advice. Such experts are likely to have an engineering background, and are likely to have experience in industries well as academia,"" he said.",Newspaper

Through our Britain Connects series, they found out they're not as different as they might have thought.","On paper, Lynda Felton-Scott and Jovan Nepaul might seem to have little in common. Lynda, 75, is a retired nurse from Batley in Yorkshire, while Jovan is a 23-year-old politics student from West Bromwich.Yet both of their lives have been upended by the coronavirus. While Lynda's health problems mean she is shielding at home and receiving food parcels, Jovan has been forced to come home from university and is volunteering in the community.This week, we asked Lynda and Jovan to be the first participants in a ground-breaking new project, Britain Connects - launched today by the Daily Mirror and Daily Express. A year after we pioneered Britain Talks, which was aimed at getting the UK chatting across the Brexit divide, this is a new virtual version.This time we want to build on the new connections forming across Britain as we face the Covid-19 pandemic together.""Jovan is a lovely young man,"" Lynda says, after the pair connect via Zoom, chatting for almost two hours. ""It felt like we really did know each other straight away. I'd love to go out for a cup of tea with him when the lockdown is over. On paper, we seem different -we voted differently in the election -but we share a lot of the same values.""Jovan agrees. ""I would have never spoken to someone like Lynda in my normal life,"" he says. ""We just wouldn't have met and politically we seem very different, but we had a lot in common..""The Daily Mirror asked the pair to meet up for a virtual chat, as our country reaches a moment of peak isolation. Lynda, new to modern tech 'whatnot', chats from the living room of her flat in Batley Carr. Jovan, a digital native, is in his childhood bedroom in the Midlands with his guitar.Lynda thinks the Prime Minister is doing a reasonable job, ""the best of a bad lot"" who will ""get Brexit done"". Jovan is a Labour supporter who ""did everything in my power to stop Boris being elected"" and voted Remain.Born 52 years apart, Lynda's biggest fear is of catching Covid-19, while Jovan worries far more about what comes next for his already-struggling generation.But, as they chat, they discover they both come from NHS families. Jovan's grandmother came to Britain from Ghana in the 1950s to work in the health service as a midwife. His mum is now a matron at Birmingham City Hospital. ""She's at the hospital right now,"" Jovan says, ""on the frontline. We're very proud of her.""Lynda's dad was a pharmacist from Wallasey, as well as a navigator in the RAF during the war. And it even turns out Lynda, a former theatre and paediatric nurse, was a matron herself too. ""I was nursing for 56 years,"" she says.""Twice my lifetime,"" Jovan laughs.""I retired two years ago otherwise I would have been on the frontline myself,"" Lynda says.""You know what it's like, mum's in there all hours,"" Jovan says. ""On her day off yesterday she was called out and was there for the whole day.""While Lynda voted Conservative and Jovan is an active member of the Labour Party, both are upset by the lack of PPE for frontline workers. Lynda previously ran a care home and is especially worried for carers. Jovan worries for his mum and her colleagues.""My mum said one of her staff members had to go in with a motorbike crash helmet because they didn't have enough PPE,"" Jovan says. Lynda nods. ""I was screaming at the TV news. I could see what was going to happen and I couldn't do anything about it.""Jovan says: ""I hope this is a 1945 moment where people say there's been a particular way of doing things that hasn't really worked... so we need to fund things, we need to treat people with more dignity and respect.""Lynda nods: ""Exactly.""For Britain Connects, the Mirror and Express are also partnering with the Behavioural Insights Team. ""The coronavirus crisis has created a shared experience without precedent for all of us,"" Antonio da Silva says. ""This unique situation also means that while we adjust to the pandemic there is an opportunity to connect and bring people closer together as never before.""We will draw on evidence from behavioural science to help make that contact as fruitful as possible and in the process learn more about bridging divides between people.""It turns out Jovan and Lynda share many interests. Born in Liverpool, Lynda talks about nights spent as a student nurse at the famous Cavern Club, watching the Beatles. Jovan plays bass in the Themselves Houseband, as part of a collective that organises arts events in London.""I went to school with Paul McCartney and John Lennon, that's my only claim to fame..."" Lynda says.""I think that's cooler than anything I could ever say!"" Jovan laughs.Jovan is a keen cyclist and is amazed when Lynda produces her exercise bike. ""It keeps my legs exercising while I watch the telly,"" she says. ""I do 400 pedals a few times a day. That's more cycling than you today Jovan...""While Lynda is living off hot cross buns and prosecco brought round by a neighbour's son, Jovan is desperately missing trips to the pub. They say they are both ""living like students"", staying up late in front of the TV. They both wish they could get to the hairdresser, and Lynda teases Jovan for hiding his lockdown locks under a back-to-front baseball cap.Lynda says she's had so many generous donations - including from the local mosque - she's had to organise some rice and tins for collection to the local foodbank. Meanwhile, she's been sharing the 30 hot cross buns she had for Easter over the garden fence.Lynda is missing her grandchildren, while Jovan is missing his grandparents. ""I'm completely locked down,"" Lynda says. ""I can't even go and start the car to make sure the engine is ok.""Jovan is at least locked down with family - including his 19-year-old brother and 22-year-old sister, but he worries more about the future. ""I don't know how I'm going to pay my rent in London or whether I will ever be able to get a job now,"" he says. ""For my generation, getting the virus isn't the biggest concern.""Lynda nods sympathetically, and offers to share her last bottle of prosecco.Jovan smiles. ""Thank you for wanting to speak to me,"" he says.Lynda laughs. ""We were thrown together, but I'm so pleased we were."" And she has a final piece of advice. ""You're a lovely chap. Just don't marry a nurse.""Whoever we are, we are all facing this together.

""Going forwards, in terms of lifting lockdown, it's going to to be a very different situation. A lot of thought has to be given to how this will be managed. If it's not handled well, it risks potential divisions between groups.""Other topics included the potential benefits to harnessing the island status of the UK and Ireland, as countries such as New Zealand have done, and developing new port health policies.Prof Gabriel Scally, president of the epidemiology and public health section of the Royal Society of Medicine, noted that unlike many countries, Britain and Ireland have maintained open borders in the face of Covid-19.""That seems to me, as we go into a situation where we are thinking of lifting restrictions, places us in sudden jeopardy,"" he said, adding that a key issue at present in countries including China is cases of coronavirus imported into the country, including from citizens who had returned from travelling abroad.At a press conference, chaired by the MP David Davis, after the first meeting of the new group, King added that the government needs to manage the pandemic without banking on a vaccine, noting that it remains unclear at present how well the newly developed vaccines will work, while Prof Karl Friston, of University College London, cautioned against placing too great an emphasis on the ""effective reproduction number"", or R, which is the average number of people that one infected individual will pass the virus on to and has been a recurring figure in the government's daily press conferences.""R in an of itself is not a cause of pathology, death, suffering or any other measurements of those things,"" Friston said. Indeed R is not fixed, and is affected by a number of factors, including by policies such as social distancing.Friston added that the current prevalence of the virus in the population is a more useful figure when it comes to making important policy decisions.""R is post-hoc reflection, it is a nice statistic, it is easy to model,"" he said. ""However, it is not really the thing you should be aiming at."" ",Newspaper

Announcing the pilot during today's Downing Street press conference, Matt Hancock said participation would help the whole country ""get back on its feet"". From tonight NHS staff will be able to download the app, although it will be rolled out more generally across the island. Members of the public will receive a letter on Thursday urging them to download the app and join the trial.""We'll learn a lot, we'll use it to make things better, and we want to hear from you,"" he said. ""Where the Isle of Wight goes, Britain follows.""​But the Health Secretary stressed this was not an alternative to social distancing, saying the ""stay home"" message now had an additional plea to download the app. For more on that, and the rest of the day's news, carry on reading below.                     04 May 2020-06:21PM BST                                        And that's it for another day...                   Downing Street lost a minister-but gained an app. Boris Johnson made the case for a global endeavour-but without China and the US.And the Alternative Sage press conference mostly lost audio-a reminder to all of us that despite being six weeks into lockdown, working from home remains beset with technical challenges. I'll be back from 8am tomorrow morning, with all the rest from Westminster and beyond.                     04 May 2020-06:18PM BST                                        Here's how the NHSX contact tracer app will look                    This is what Isle of Wight key workers will see when they start downloading the app from tonight. The rest of us will have to wait a little longer...                     04 May 2020-05:56PM BST                                        Hancock: Privacy 'front of mind' on app development                   Asked about data privacy on use of the app, Matt Hancock says it is an ""incredibly important question"". The app has been designed with privacy and security front of mind, he adds. The data is stored on an individual's phone, not by the NHS, he says, until a person has symptoms and needs a test, and the NHS needs to contact those who people have been in contact with. John Newton, testing tzar, reiterates much of this, saying it is ""a very safe use of data"". Mr Hancock notes there is a busy hospital and other key workers on the island, so there are ""interactions and there are new cases on the island"" which will make it an effective place to trial it.                      04 May 2020-05:52PM BST                                        Hancock: There will be 'huge demand' for vaccine because of 'obvious benefits'                   Asked if he thinks there will be any issues convincing parents to have their children vaccinated Matt Hancock says he believes there will be ""very very high take-up"" of a vaccine based on people's willingness to live with social distancing measures. There are ""obvious benefits to individuals, families and indeed the whole nation"", which means he thinks there will be ""huge demand for it"". Jonathan Van-Tam adds that experts are ""very hopeful there will be a breakthrough"". The first vaccines will likely be licenced for adults, rather than children, first. So far the epidemiological evidence suggests that the elderly are more at risk. Asked if there was a message for anti-vaxxers, Mr Hancock says there is no greater demontration for the need for a vaccine than the outbreak of Covid-19. We will only licence a vaccine when it is effective and safe.                     04 May 2020-05:48PM BST                                        Hancock: Can't assume protection even after you have caught Covid-19                   Matt Hancock has said he wouldn't be comfortable walking into a crowded environment, despite having had the disease, until the science has established he is protected.""I very much hope the science shows the people with antibodies have a low risk of transmitting the disease and a low risk of catching it,"" he says. ""I very much hope that is where the science comes out, but we have to make sure we have the science because until we know it we can't base a policy decision and I can't be comfortable [walking into a crowded environment]."" There are so many things that are different between this and the six other coronaviruses that exist, Mr Hancock says, that you can't take the risk of assuming things.                      04 May 2020-05:44PM BST                                        Matt Hancock taking part in coronavirus antibody trial                    Matt Hancock says there will be estimates of the proportion fo the population with antibodies ""soon""-but the effect on your chance of catching coronavirus is still ""rapidly developing"". Jonathan Van-Tam says they are still trying to understand if you get antibodies, if they protect you and how long they protect you for. We have started calling people back who have had Covid-19 for sure and ask them to take part in a plasma trial to understand if it will work and save lives. That programme has started and the overwhelming majority of people who have had definite Covid-19 do have antibodies. They take different time to develop but by and large, they develop. This disease hasn't existed for long enough to know whether it protect people, Van-Tam adds, and we need to be much clearer before we can give a clear answer on that. We do know that for other normal coronaviruses-the ones that cause the common cold-they don't persist for years and years. It doesn't follow that it will be the same for Covid-19, he adds. We will need to test people repeatedly. An absolutely massive piece of work is now underway to look for antibodies and follow people who have recovered for a couple of years, he says and Mr Hancock confirms he is in the trial.                      04 May 2020-05:37PM BST                                        Pilot will not see early exit strategy on Isle of Wight, says Hancock                   Asked why the Isle of Wight was chosen, given the elderly population, Matt Hancock says partly because of the challenges-not everyone has a smart phone-was a reason to pick the island. Mr Hancock stresses that there are no changes to social distancing rules yet, and that changes to the measures will only take place when the five tests are met. He adds it will be nationally, rather than the Isle of Wight being different to the rest of the country. John Newton says other reasons that made it ""ideal"" are because it's relatively hard to get on and off it, and that is it ""very well equipped"" to respond, and says he thinks it will be a great success. He adds he knows a lot of elderly people who are ""extremely tech savvy"" but people don't have to have the app to benefit, although it is an important component. People who are most likely to be out and possibly ""bumping into people"" are those who have smart phones.                      04 May 2020-05:33PM BST                                        NHSX app will still be effective despite high cases                   Matt Hancock has said the app can be effective despite the relatively high number of cases in the UK, but admitted it will be ""more effective the fewer cases there are"".Even with social distancing measures there are still some new cases and that means that the technology can still be effective, Mr Hancock said. Even with the scale of new cases across the country, the app will still be effective. It is just more effective the fewer cases there are. But it is social distancing that is having the big impact. The message remains stay at home, protect the NHS and save lives-unless you're in the Isle of Wight. The message is still to stay at home, but also to download the app, Mr Hancock says.                     04 May 2020-05:30PM BST                                        Test, track and trace programme a 'multilayered' approach: Newton                   Matt Hancock says the test, track and trace programme is not just about technology but about people ""acting in the right way"". John Newton, testing tzar, said the app was ""very exciting"" but the programme was ""integrated"" with contact tracing and testing. Traditional contact tracing isn't that traditional, he adds. It's a multilayered approach, and the Isle of Wight pilot will help us understand it better.                      04 May 2020-05:28PM BST                                        Thousands of tracers already recruited: Hancock                   The Government has recruited thousands of people to help its track and trace programme ""and making very rapid progress"" to get to the 18,000 number by mid-May, Matt Hancock says. Mr Hancock added it is ""not just recruitment but training that is necessary"". He says there are enough people to get going on the Isle of Wight-"" as of 5pm that is up and running"", he adds.But there is no magic around the 18,00 number-that is the initial scale we think is needed. If we find out from ONS survey we will adjust that number, but it will be up and running by the end of the month.                      04 May 2020-05:25PM BST                                        Test, track and trace will not keep rates down on its own                   Matt Hancock says test, track and trace will help to keep infection rates down, but not on its own. The goal is to keep the number of new infections going down, and bringing in the new programme from tomorrow in the Isle of Wight and the rest of the country thereafter will help that. Our goal is not simply to flatten the curve, but to get the occurance to very low levels, he adds.                      04 May 2020-05:22PM BST                                        Government will ""get to the bottom"" of high BAME frontline worker deaths                    Asked what steps are being taken to support NHS staff who have died, Matt Hancock pays tribute to those who have lost their lives, saying NHS is ""an amazing organisation"" built on many people who come from around the world. He says he wants to learn what we can from ""every single case"". Mr Hancock also points to the programme of support on offer to the family of those who die. Specifically on the issue of higher BAME death rates, Jonathan Van-Tam promises to ""get to the bottom of this"", but says it is complicated because you have to take into account differences in the patterns of medical conditions which vary by ethnic group, as well as deprivation and where people live. All of this is complex and takes time, he says.                      04 May 2020-05:15PM BST                                        Van Tam: Very clear we are past the peak                   Going through the slides, Jonathan Van-Tam says it is ""now very clear we are past the peak"".But he says ""we must get new cases lower"".On testing, we are in a very good position, he adds.More than 85,000 tests were completed as of 9am today and we are will within our capacity.                      04 May 2020-05:11PM BST                                        App trial does not mean end of social distancing: Hancock                   This trial does not mean the end of social distancing on the Isle of Wight or anywhere else, Matt Hancock says. That will only come with the five tests are met. He updates the well-worn Government message to stay at home, download the app to protect the NHS and save lives.                     04 May 2020-05:09PM BST                                        Test, track and trace app to be piloted in Isle of Wight from tomorrow                   Test, track and trace will be piloted in Isle of Wight tomorrow and rolled out to ""all citizens"", Matt Hancock says. By participating they are helping the whole of the country get back on its feet, he says. Where the Isle of Wight goes, the rest of the ocuntry will follow. Contact tracing will go live tonight and from tomorrow NHS staff can download the app, before being rolled out more generally. He urges all Islanders to download the app ""to protect the health of your community"". By embracing test, track and trace you will be saving lives, he says.                      04 May 2020-05:07PM BST                                        Daily death toll falls to lowest level since March: Hancock                   The daily death total has fallen to the lowest level in more than a month, Matt Hancock has said. In total 28,734 people have died across all settings, an increase of 288-lower than at any point since the end of March, Mr Hancock said. However he said that the Government expects that number to rise because of the weekend lag.                     04 May 2020-04:39PM BST                                        Watch: Boris Johnson addresses world leaders at the coronavirus global response conference                   Earlier today, Boris Johnson stressed the need for the world to work together in tackling coronavirus, through developing a vaccine and other treatments (see 2:46pm). Watch his address below:                     04 May 2020-04:31PM BST                                        Now 'logistically feasible' to test asymptomatic people: Friston                   The rate of infection is now sufficiently low to keep on top of people who are not showing symptoms, a member of the alternative Sage group has said. If you were testing after the onset of the outbreak of the virus, you would have had over a million tests a day, according to UCL's Karl Friston.But in the calm after the storm you can get away with identifying around 20 per cent of asymptomatic people with a logistically feasible rate of 10-100,000 tests a day. It is entirely feasible that the Government's strategic response on testing is now aiming at this, he adds. That is the most important strategic aspect facing the Government, Prof Friston says.                      04 May 2020-04:13PM BST                                        Watch: The Alternative Sage press conference                   Sir David King is giving a press conference, following the first meeting of the Alternative Sage group, which aims to challenge the existing group over a lack of independence.But the audio is so bad that you can either hear two Sir Davids, or none. Then you can hear people talking over each other. It's a bit of a technical mess so far. Watch for yourselves-if you can bring yourself to.                      04 May 2020-04:00PM BST                                        NHSX App will develop alongside understanding of virus                   Matthew Gould has admitted there will be ""unintended consequences"" from using the NHSX app, saying the team doesn't know ""exactly how it will work"" yet. ""I think we need to level with the public on this that when we launch it, it won't be perfect,"" he told the Human Rights Committee. ""As our understanding of the virus develops, so will the app and we will add features to it.""The team is taking advice about whether it was right for a child to download the app for example. Mr Gould noted that some young people may find it ""really scary"" to receive a notification that they may be infected.He added: ""I think there is an additional obligation on us that we have really thought through all the angles, how the messages will land.""                     04 May 2020-03:49PM BST                                        NHSX app will tell individual hospitals to prepare for surge in cases                   The Government app that will play a central role in efforts to keep on top of coronavirus in the second phase will tell hospitals when a new surge in cases is likely. Speaking to the Human Rights Committee, NHSX chief executive Matthew Gold said the data going into the app was detailed enough that it could tell an individual hospital ""they are going to need to prepare themselves for an upsurge in cases, but broadbrush enough to make sure there is no danger of identifying individual people"", he said. And at the end of the crisis it will either be deleted or anonymised in line with law so it can be used for research purposes. Asked what legal guarantees he can give, Mr Gould said once the health emergency is finished, the basis for holding the data changes. Elizabeth Denham, Information Commissioner, explains that the Data Protection Act ""covers off"" all these issues relating to the app.                      04 May 2020-03:37PM BST                                        Watch again: Nicola Sturgeon reveals Scotland's ""test, trace and isolate"" programme                   Nicola Sturgeon set out her plans for Scotland's ""test, trace and isolate"" programme earlier today. Although the phrase is slightly different to Downing Street's ""test, track and trace"", the model itself is likely to be quite similar to what we will hear from Number 10. Watch again below.                     04 May 2020-03:23PM BST                                        Gove rebuffs Brexit criticism                   Michael Gove is facing down a series of questions about Brexit and the ongoing talks, but he is not taking the bait. He tells SNP MPs that the referendum result needs to be honoured-and advises that they do likewise with the independence referendum. Asked about uncertainty in light of coronavirus, he insists that any further delay would make things more uncertain. And asked about Michel Barnier's comments, accusing the UK of ""running down the clock"", Mr Gove says he doesn't want to ""prejudice"" the constructive conversations that have been taking place between Mr Barnier and David Frost so far.                      04 May 2020-03:20PM BST                                        NHSX boss: I am a number, not a name, to tracking app                   The boss of the NHS's digital arm has stressed that privacy is ""right at the heart"" of the app that the Government hopes will play a crucial role in the second phase of the lockdown. Matthew Gould, told the Human Rights select committee: ""We're not saying people have to give personal information in order to use the app.""The one thing we're asking for is the first half of the postcode to build up hotspots and manage the crisis.""It (the app) doesn't know me as 'M Gould'-it knows me as a number.""Mr Gould also said he was ""profoundly grateful to the people of the Isle of Wight"" for their participation in the smartphone app trial. Noting that even a low rate of participation-around 20 per cent-gave good insight, higher levels would ""really make a big difference"" in the Government's test, track and trace programme.                      04 May 2020-03:14PM BST                                        Gove dodges questions about non-medical face masks                   Michael Gove has dodged questions about how many non-medical face masks were available for public use. Rachel Reeves asked the Cabinet Office Secretary twice what work the Government was carrying out to ensure there was sufficient supply for the public, on the assumption that they will be advised for use in confined areas such as public transport. Mr Gove noted there was ""a clear distinction"" between those used by frontline workers and ""the sort of face covering that can be worn in order to shield others"". He said work was ongoing to ensure domestic production, highlighting Lord Deighton's work on this front. Pressed again, Mr Gove stressed that millions of medical-grade masks had been shipped but did not answer the question about the wider public, which he said was ""a very different exercise"" and numbers would be much greater because of the difference in materials.                      04 May 2020-03:05PM BST                                        More than 600 people take part in Oxford vaccine trial                   Some 601 people have taken part in the Oxford vaccine trial, Business Secretary Alok Sharma has confirmed.Mr Sharma said: ""Last week, thanks to the UK Government's financial support of £20m the Oxford vaccine entered clinical trials in humans, and I can update the House that as of today, 601 people have taken part in that trial.""""We continue to talk to Oxford to understand its manufacturing needs"".He also pointed to the collaboration with AstraZeneca on this front.He also echoed the Prime Minister's comments earlier today and reiterated the Government's pledge of £388m towards a global £8bn target, to be used for medical research into Covid-19.                     04 May 2020-03:00PM BST                                        When is a Sage scientist not a Sage scientist?                   Behavioural scientist Susan Michie has told the alternative Sage group that guidance must remain the same across the country or risk undermining collective solidarity.Ms Michie, who heads up UCL's centre for behaviour change, said success so far had been down to ""the collective solidarity that has been built up as people have been rising to the challenges, which for some people in some living conditions have been extremely challenging indeed"". But she warned that if advice changes for some and not others ""this has the potential for undermining the collective solidarity that has been so important for trust, for adherence, for helping each other"", HuffPo reports.However it is not clear why Ms Michie, who recently made this very point to The Telegraph, was speaking with Sir David King's alternative scientific group as            she appears on the official Sage list published by the Government earlier today.                      04 May 2020-02:46PM BST                                        Boris Johnson: Defeating coronavirus will be a 'truly global effort'                   Boris Johnson has urged countries to work together to fight Covid-19, saying it is ""humanity against the virus"". In a pre-recorded statement that broadcast as part of his contribution to today's pledging conference, the Prime Minister said working together meant the richest countries could support the poorest. ""The more we pool together and share our expertise, the faster we will be able to find a vaccine,"" he said. ""When we do find a vaccine, it is vital that we are able to distribute it to everyone who needs it. Countries and pharmaceutical companies will need to work together in a way that defies the usual ways of operating.""The race to develop a vaccine is not about competition between countries but a shared endeavour, he says.                      04 May 2020-02:23PM BST                                        Further 204 people die in English hospitals                    A further 204 people who have tested positive for Covid-19 have died, bringing the total number of confirmed reported deaths in hospitals in England to 21,384, NHS England has said.The highest number for the most hospital deaths occurring on a single day continues to be 8th April, with a current total of 867.Earlier today Public Health Wales said a further 14 people had died in the nation, taking the total number of deaths to 997.Meanwhile Nicola Sturgeon reported five new coronavirus deaths in Scotland, taking the total there to 1,576.                     04 May 2020-02:13PM BST                                        Jeremy Corbyn thanks 'great friend and comrade' Jennie Formby                    Former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has thanked his ""great friend and comrade"" Jennie Formby, who stepped down as general secretary of the party earlier today.

But some of this will be costly, and much of it will require continued adherence. So will it work? 04 May 2020-11:00AM BSTHow do high risk employees fit into the back-to-work blueprint?High risk employees, those who are currently being shielded because they are extremely vulnerable, will continue to work from home if possible. Non-shielded but still vulnerable people can go back to their work places if necessary but must take ""extra care"", the Government's draft plans suggest. If they cannot work from home they should be offered the safest possible roles, and employers must offer support including for employees' mental health and wellbeing.04 May 2020-10:53AM BSTMore on the Government's back-to-work blueprintEmployers will be expected to significantly shake things up in offices and workplaces, under draft proposals from the Department for Business. As well as staggered shifts, they will be asked to provide extra parking and bike racks as the Government looks to reduce reliance on public transport. Companies will also be asked to put signs out to guide staff in and out of offices to minimise contact with other people, and markings put in confined areas such as lifts. Access may be restricted to part of a given workplace to encourage people to move around less.Work stations should be two metres apart where possible, and where that is not possible extra attention should be paid to hygiene. Additional handwashing stations will also be required, and in some consumer-facing workplaces screens will be necessary. These could also be deployed in work places where the two metre rule is not possible. Staff should be asked to change out of uniforms on site, and employers will be responsible for washing them, the plans suggest.04 May 2020-10:41AM BSTGovernment's draft plans for getting back to workAlthough we still have a few days to wait until Boris Johnson sets out the Government's ""roadmap"", one of my colleagues has seen draft documents that make clear the direction of travel.Under the draft plan, seen by The Telegraph's Economics reporter Lizzie Burden, firms will be encouraged to stop colleagues from hot desking and sharing equipment, stagger shift times and maximise home-working.The Department for Business docs also highlights additional hygiene procedures, physical screens and the use of protective equipment should be considered where maintaining distancing of two metres between workers is impossible.They also suggest shifts be staggered, staff canteens will stay closed and lifts kept half-empty. Regular face-to-face meetings will likely become a thing of the past-people will be urged to do virtual meetings where possible, and if not there should be markings to set out where someone can sit. 04 May 2020-10:31AM BSTHS2 protesters block construction site over PPE concernsProtesters have blocked construction sites for the HS2 rail link in London and Warwickshire, claiming work should not take place during the coronavirus crisis.HS2 Rebellion argue the work is non-essential and is putting the lives of workers and their families at risk.The protesters said they were respecting social distancing guidelines by wearing gloves and masks and claimed the actions were part of their state-sanctioned daily exercise.""Our nurses and doctors are without PPE, yet these workers can continue because the Government deems them key workers,"" said one, in a video posted online.

She says there is ""a lot of fear out there"". Smaller firms and sole traders are concerned about prioritisation and are ""desperate"" for funding. ""If every single SME applies for this, and takes £50,000, that is going to be a lot of money and a lot of administration,"" she says. She says while the big banks have been able to start giving out bounce back loans already, she wants start this week to help those who are too small. ""In this environment we are gearing up to do this as quickly as possible.""04 May 2020-10:01AM BSTBanks expect 'significant volumes' of bounce back loansBank bosses have said they expect ""significant volumes"" of bounce back loans being paid out to businesses. The micro loans, which chancellor Rishi Sunak announced last week, went live this morning. The loan is 100 per cent Government-backed. Lloyds Banking Group saw around 2,000 in the first two hours, said David Oldfield, group director for commercial banking. He added that the average loan size so far is about £35,000. HSBC's Amanda Murphy stressed ""the importance of communication with clients so they fully understand it is a loan, not a grant"".She said there had been ""some confusion out there"". There were also concerns about fraud, because applicants merely fill out a short form, but ""it's a risk we are prepared to take"", said Starling Bank chief executive Anne Boden.04 May 2020-09:44AM BSTWhat's on the agenda: Two-metre ruleThis morning the possibility of relaxing the two-metre rule has shot up the agenda, with Defence Secretary Ben Wallace mentioning it in at least three interviews, while Sage member Sir Jeremy Farrar stressed there was ""nothing magical"" about it.

During an interview with the BBC he implied that those working for the Government now were not free to speak their minds.Asked specifically about this point, he said: ""I believe that's the case, yes. I think there's a very big difference between the situation today and the situation as it was in 2010-11. That is quite simply the permission to speak in the public domain has been changed.""I think the main point I'm making is that an independent science advisory group really needs to be dominated by people whose income is not determined by the fact they are working for the Government.""04 May 2020-09:29AM BSTComing up today in Westminster and beyond...It's a busy non-bank holiday day today (the holiday has been moved to Friday 8th May to coincide with VE day).In just a few minutes, we will hear from top bods from some of the UK's biggest banks including HSBC and Barclays, who are appearing before the Treasury Select Committee to talk about the economic impact of coronavirus. The global virtual pledging conference will take place this afternoon, with Boris Johnson expected to speak at around 2pm (see 8:15am for more). Then at 2:30pm we will hear from the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy, with ministers likely to be fielding questions about how workplaces will manage the return to work. At the same time, the joint committee on human rights will be grilling Matthew Gould, chief executive of NHSX, and others about privacy concerns raised by the new tracing app that is being touted as a key tool in the second phase of dealing with coronavirus.After that it'll be the Cabinet Office's turn, with Michael Gove answering a range of questions about the Government's response to coronavirus.

516,Ministers warned not to 'alienate' sections of population and undermine 'collective solidarity' when relaxing lockdown;Comments come during inaugural session of 'independent Sage' group,"May 4, 2020 Monday",International,The Independent (United Kingdom),470,470,England & Wales,Ashley Cowburn,Ministers warned not to 'alienate' sections of population and undermine 'collective solidarity' when relaxing lockdownComments come during inaugural session of 'independent Sage' group,"Ministers risk undermining the ""collective solidarity"" among the British public, sowing division, anger and resentment if the relaxation of the lockdown is not handled well, a senior behavioural scientist has warned.The comments came during the inaugural session of a group of experts shadowing the government's scientific advisory group for emergencies (Sage), and amid calls for greater transparency on the advice provided to No 10 by the body.Led by Sir David King - a chief scientific adviser to government between 2000 and 2007 - the newly-created ""independent Sage"" held its first session on Monday, with nearly a dozen experts analysing the UK's response to the coronavirus pandemic. Later this week, Boris Johnson must review the current lockdown and the prime minister will launch an action plan to ease the country out of its current restrictive measures. Rather than being sudden return to the ""old normal"", cabinet minister Michael Gove said on Sunday that the government would pursue a ""phased approach"" to any relaxation of rules.Susan Michie, a behaviour psychologist at UCL, who also sits on a sub-committee of Sage, said during the virtual session that people were surprised at ""how adherent"" the British public had been to government guidance so far.""I think a lot of that has been down to the collective solidarity that has been built up as people have been rising to the challenges which for some people in some living conditions has been extremely challenging indeed,"" she said.But going forward, professor Michie added: ""In terms of lifting the lockdown its going to be a very different situation because in the lockdown similar measures were being carried out across the whole population by and large. But what we are going to be seeing is different measures for different sections of the population. ""This has the potential for undermining the collective solidarity that has been so important for trust, for adherence, for helping each other. If it's not handled well risks potential division between groups, risked perceived inequality and injustice and unfairness which can lead to resentment and anger and people getting alienated.""Prof Allyson Pollock, the director of Newcastle University's centre for excellence in regulatory science, also claimed during the session that covid-19 has ""shone a spotlight on widening inequalities"" in Britain, as she criticised the austerity cuts to public services and local authorities. And she described the government's publication of the daily death toll and testing counts as a ""propaganda tool"" because the data ""is unreliable when reported daily"". Prof Allyson recommended that the Office for National Statistics (ONS) publishes the statistics either once a week, or once a fortnight, to combat the ""inaccurate and incoherent"" data sent out to the public.",Newspaper; Web Publication
517,"Coronavirus Ireland: No clamouring for end to lockdown, government told","May 4, 2020 Monday",International,thetimes.co.uk,681,681,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,Brian Mahon,"Coronavirus Ireland: No clamouring for end to lockdown, government told","There is no appetite among most of the public for an easing of the restrictions designed to fight Covid-19, a researcher at an influential think tank has said.Pete Lunn, head of the behavioural research unit at the Economic and Social Research Institute (ESRI), told                    The Times                   : ""Believe me, there is no clamouring in our data for lifting restrictions, the majority of people are actually quite scared and worried about it. The majority of people think there is likely to be a second surge and are really quite nervous about restrictions being lifted. So it's a vocal minority that is crying out for restrictions being lifted.""The government reported that 16 people with Covid-19 died yesterday, while there were 266 new cases. There have now been 1,319 Covid-19 related deaths in Ireland, and 21,772 confirmed cases.Professor Lunn was speaking about research the ESRI had carried out on the exit strategy material published by the government over the weekend. Professor Lunn is a member of a group which advises the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) on behavioural change.Ireland's Covid-19 restrictions, requiring most people to stay in their homes and most businesses to close, were originally set to expire today. They have been extended to May 18, at which point they are expected to be unwound in five stages spread out over three-week intervals to August 10.Professor Lunn said: ""We had people responding to mock-up announcements and had people respond to how they thought they'd cope. This is primarily a public health decision, but public health interacts with behavioural science because how well people will cope when they comply [with restrictions] will also determine how effective the measures will be.""He said that the ESRI study looked at how often Ireland's Covid-19 restrictions should be reviewed, and how the length of the review period would affect compliance. People expressed a preference for restrictions being eased after a longer period if it meant the measures would be more effective.""What that tells you is the public are trading off the desire to make progress against needing reassurance, because they are actually quite scared,"" Professor Lunn.He said that the public were also more likely to respond to emotional messaging to socially distance rather than take simple directions on how to practice it. Research published yesterday, and carried out by the ESRI on behalf of the Department of Health, found that the thought of infecting vulnerable people or large numbers of people could motivate individuals to practice social distancing better than basic information on recommended behaviour.For the study 500 people reviewed draft information campaigns and were asked how they thought they would moderate their own behaviour in the coming days.Three sets of posters were shown to the participants. One was a simple information poster with the text only showing how to follow the social distancing guidelines.The second poster showed images of groups of people sitting together. The text accompanying one of the images, of three people hanging out in a park together, said: ""He says it's fine. It's just a normal cold. He will pass the virus on to his granny. If he had stayed at home, she'd have been okay.""A third poster had the same image but said: ""He will now infect three people, they will infect nine people. Those nine will infect 27 . . .""A fifth of respondents who were initially less likely to be cautious were more likely to be very cautious after viewing the second and third posters. Professor Lunn said that while the public did not want to admit it, they were more likely to respond to emotional messaging rather than fact-based messaging.""That study has informed various bits of the department's and HSE's communication strategies, but you can never be totally sure how it works,"" he said. ""You have to remind people why we are doing this. If you want people to maintain social distance, giving people something at an emotional level to engage with why this matters so much is important.""",Newspaper; Web Publication
518,It's time to unlock the lockdown and trust the common sense of the British people,"May 4, 2020 Monday",International,telegraph.co.uk,623,623,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,By Iain Duncan Smith,It's time to unlock the lockdown and trust the common sense of the British people,"I wrote some three weeks ago that we were fast approaching the moment when we would have to begin unlocking.Already back then it was clear that the British people had imbibed the message of staying at home to protect the NHS and save lives to such a degree that adherence to the lockdown had been more effective than many had believed possible.This response bought time for the NHS to build extra capacity and the resilience it desperately needed. No one understands that more than the Prime Minister who, since his own illness, has movingly articulated the desperate fear so many have felt. Yet he also knows time and tide wait for no man and he now faces perhaps the biggest decision of all - whether to unlock now, and how.Confronting him is the fact that at the present rate of government expenditure,the UK is likely to end this year with a fiscal deficit of almost 15 per cent of GDP, far worse than the economic crisis in 2008.Public debt is set to rise above 100 per cent of national income, an all-time high in peacetime, and it's also becoming clear that a quarter of companies have already stopped, while others are in danger of following.Because this has been a global shutdown, the UK's economic output will almost certainly drop by around a third during the second quarter.That is why, although I welcome the Government's statement that they will present a blueprint, I am still concerned about the possibility of further delay, perhaps because polling shows that nearly a third of the public say they don't want to leave lockdown at all and two thirds confess they are worried about leaving home.This fear has in part been shaped by the strong message and the false idea that we face a choice between saving lives and saving the economy. In reality a strong economy also saves lives and we need to think about both - perhaps we should publish the bankruptcy and unemployment figures at the daily conference to help inform people.Yet the recent behaviour of the public should give us confidence about unlocking because it has shown they are more than capable of understanding a clearly explained message. This means we could proceed with ideas such as the plan put forward by the economists Prof Paul Ormerod and Dr Gerard Lyons to unlock different sectors at different rates to restore economic activity while reducing the risk of a second wave.This is why for some weeks I have asked the Government to take the British people into its confidence and to explain the balance of risks. Instead, it has proceeded with the idea that to do so would confuse people and jeopardise the lockdown.A phased approach is the right one, but it needs to be governed not just by medical advice but by behavioural science and economics as well. Several countries are worth looking at, such as Sweden which did not lock down to the same level as the UK. There is also a need to test, track and trace. I note the talk of an app in development, but we must be careful not to damage the economy further by insisting we cannot unlock until such an app is ready. The critical component as we go forward is a clear path that people understand. This would allow them to support the focus on maintaining social distancing and public hygiene.After six weeks of lockdown, we mustn't lose sight of how vital a functioning economy is to our health and wellbeing. Perhaps we should remember President Roosevelt's wise words in a time of crisis: ""The only thing we have to fear is fear itself.""That's why, with determination tempered by care, and by trusting the common sense of the British people, we should start the process of ending the lockdown.

519,I didn't think it applied to me... but suddenly it did;John Rentoul looks back at the growth of the pandemic and how we realised the world was being turned upside down,"May 4, 2020 Monday",International,The Independent (United Kingdom),2282,2282,England & Wales,JOHN RENTOUL,I didn't think it applied to me... but suddenly it didJohn Rentoul looks back at the growth of the pandemic and how we realised the world was being turned upside down,"I was woken by the silence. That is when I should have known the world was about to change. Usually, the planes start flying out of London City airport at 6am, but I am so used to them I don't hear them. I mean, I was so used to them I didn't hear them. That morning, 10 March, was before anything had really happened. The government had told us to wash our hands, and some people had stopped shaking each others'. Offices, including The Independent, were getting ready for staff to work from home, although we weren't sure that would be necessary. And people were travelling less, hence the lack of planes.Even so, I didn't think any of it applied to me. It being Tuesday, I went to the House of Commons as normal. I travelled by Tube, and thought nothing of it. I did a day's work and came home. It was the last time I was there. The next day was Budget day. I expected to watch from the press gallery as Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn went through the motions of prime minister's questions - likely to be an even lower-key encounter than usual just before the main event. Then I would be writing about Rishi Sunak's big speech.But the first news of the day was that Nadine Dorries, the junior health minister, had tested positive for the coronavirus. I can do the Budget from home, I thought. It is not as good, because part of the political intelligence about a big event comes from the buzz of ideas and conversations in the press gallery offices. But one of the things about my job is that it is perfectly possible to do it remotely.I don't know Dorries, but she is one of the people I might pass on my way to the office. Some of the journalists I work with might have met her recently. Suddenly coronavirus did apply to me. Having half-thought that I'd probably already had it (I think almost everyone did), I now thought I probably hadn't and, although I wasn't worried about my own health (the prime minister had already said that for most people it was mild), I didn't want to spread it, so it was not worth going to the one place I knew where someone definitely had got it.So I watched the Budget speech and wrote about it from home. The chancellor announced £30bn of extra spending, paid for by borrowing, to deal with the effect of coronavirus. At the time it seemed the main economic impact might be that as many as one in five people might have to take time off work. We didn't know it, but by the time Sunak sat down, his Budget was already out of date. The prime minister was preparing to make a dramatic announcement the next day.The previous week I had been to a reception for journalists held by Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London. It is an annual event, although this year it was more important because there was an election coming up. You could tell there was an election coming up because Khan and his staff kept using the phrase ""two-horse race"". I think this was designed to suggest that Rory Stewart, the Tory independent, was a no-hoper trying to break into a contest between Khan and Shaun Bailey, his official Tory opponent. To me, it suggested that Stewart was Khan's real challenger.None of that matters now. The election has been postponed to next year, and looking back it was strange that so many people packed themselves into a tiny space - the mayor holds his parties in what is no more than a corridor in the glass bulb of City Hall with a fine view of Tower Bridge and the City. The mayor himself wasn't shaking hands. At the time, this was unusual, especially for a politician, and more especially for one on the lookout for votes.Khan told me he had just been at an event with Prince Charles, which had raised the question of whether they should shake hands with each other. Khan had consulted his aides, who told him he would have to take the prince's hand if it was offered. It was, and Khan said he was surprised that Charles shook hands with everybody. I remember being surprised that Khan was surprised. Shaking hands with people is, after all, Charles's job. (Three weeks later, Charles tested positive and went into isolation.)Khan's reception was two days after Boris Johnson held his first news conference on coronavirus. He was flanked, for the first time but closer than two metres away, by Professor Chris Whitty and Sir Patrick Vallance, in a room in 10 Downing Street full of journalists. ""I continue to shake hands,"" said the prime minister. In words that would soon become notorious, he tried to sound cheerful and business-as-usual: ""I was at a hospital the other night where I think a few there were actually coronavirus patients and I shook hands with everybody, you'll be pleased to know.""People were free to make up their own minds, he said, and with a nod to his medical and scientific advisers, he added: ""Our judgement is washing your hands is the crucial thing.""We can now see that the period from the election on 12 December until the prime minister's news conference on 12 March, the day after the Budget, was a three-month phoney peace. For political journalists, Brexit was a total war that had lasted three and a half years since the referendum. For all that time there was one story. If it had been plotted by the gods, they laid a false trail that dominated most of the narrative, of Theresa May's doomed attempt to find a compromise acceptable to the EU and to the UK parliament. Then there came the great plot twist, by which Boris Johnson managed, with unexpected help from Jo Swinson and Jeremy Corbyn, to turn his failure to deliver Brexit into an election triumph six weeks later.Our actual departure from the EU, on 31 January, was an anticlimactic epilogue. It happened during the phoney peace, in which I wrote articles with headlines such as: ""Keir Starmer is likely to win the Labour leadership race, because politics is returning to boring normal.""I usually keep a short list of ideas for possible articles. In the week of the Budget, I had three items on it: David Frost, the prime minister's EU negotiator, who seems an interesting person (someone had just told me he was a keen Labour supporter at university); another attempt to explain why Heathrow expansion would (and should) never happen; and something on Corbyn's view of party democracy, which didn't extend to bringing back elections to the shadow cabinet. After the intensity of the Brexit years, it seemed as if politics had returned to some kind of normality. I thought I might even have time to go to the dentist.Although I had already been woken by the sound of no planes, and although I had already decided to work from home for the time being, the prime minister's news conference on Thursday 12 March came as a profound shock. Again flanked by Whitty and Vallance, Johnson said: ""I must level with you, I must level with the British public. Many more families are going to lose loved ones before their time.""He announced that the government was moving from trying to contain the virus to trying to delay its spread. He said that anyone showing the symptoms should stay at home for seven days, and that the aim was to ""squash the sombrero"" of the graph showing the peak of infections. The government was ""considering"" banning big sports events, but thought that closing schools could ""do more harm than good at this time"". In hindsight, the measures seem remarkably tentative. The prime minister concluded: ""Don't forget, wash your hands and we will get through this.""At the time, though, it was a lurch into a new, all-consuming single news story. The first two questions from journalists were ""How sure are you that the approach is right?"" and ""How many will die?""After that, I wrote about almost nothing else in my political commentary. Even articles about Keir Starmer's election as Labour leader were focused on the strange times in which he was to take over. I wrote up a class given by Tony Blair to our students at King's College London before the shutters came down - and he was asked a couple of questions about the impending crisis. Only my sidelines of pedantry (the Mea Culpa column) and trivia (the weekly Top 10s) kept me from monomania.The first 11 days seemed to bring unprecedented escalation in the crisis every day. On Monday 16 March Johnson asked people to avoid social contact, imposing what was later described as a ""voluntary lockdown"": he urged people not to go to the pub and advised against inessential travel. On 18 March, he was asked about legislating to require people to stay at home and said: ""We live in a land of liberty ??? We don't tend to impose those sorts of restrictions on people in this country. But I have to tell you we will rule nothing out."" Two days later, the schools closed.Meanwhile, the chancellor rewrote his Budget twice, first announcing 10 times as much unfunded public spending as in the Budget itself, and then unlimited sums on paying 80 per cent of people's wages and bailing out companies.On Monday 23 March, we entered the dreamlike state of full lockdown. The prime minister addressed the nation and said: ""We will stop all gatherings of more than two people in public."" People were required to stay at home and shops selling non-essential goods were closed. Since then, time has seemed to stand still.I recount all this because I think it is important to remember how little we knew when this started, and to try to counter hindsight-based interpretations of what the government should have done. At the time, Johnson appeared sometimes to be lagging behind public opinion. When he was asked on 12 March how sure he was his approach was right, the question meant: why aren't you imposing a full lockdown as they are doing in other countries? But he was following the advice of the experts, which is why they were standing next to him.Whitty, the chief medical officer, answered the question by saying that behavioural science shows that ""if you start too early, and then people's enthusiasm runs out just about the peak, which is exactly the time that we want people to be doing these interventions, that is not a productive way to do it; so we want people to do it at the last point that is reasonable, so that people maintain their energy and enthusiasm"".Since then, and despite time standing still, much has happened. It was only three days after telling people not to leave their homes that Johnson and Matt Hancock, the health secretary, tested positive for the virus. Then came the drama early last month when the prime minister was admitted to hospital, and moved to intensive care ""as a precaution"" the next day. Followed, three days later, by the ratcheting down of the narrative tension with his move out of intensive care and, after another three days, his discharge to Chequers - the prime minister's country residence, which also featured prominently in the previous total-immersion news story as the setting for the cabinet split over Theresa May's Brexit compromise.Johnson's video address to the nation, recorded at Chequers on 12 April, was a minor masterpiece of leadership by empathy, praising the NHS and the immigrant nurses who had looked after him and trying to embody, by his vigour and his combination of seriousness and optimism, the Churchillian spirit of KBO.And then we waited. We wondered at the resilience of the national broadband network, which allowed everyone to watch videos, including of each other, all the time. Experts disputed on social media whether Netflix and YouTube needed to downgrade their entertainments from high definition to standard, but the rest of us were pleasantly surprised that the internet had not collapsed.We noted, too, that the food industry responded quickly to changing patterns of demand, with only strong bread flour for bread makers still in short supply.We learned about ourselves and the surprising things we enjoy about enforced isolation: the silence, the empty roads, the people being kind to each other and politely acknowledging the etiquette of social distance in public places. The things we miss about the office, or, in my case, both my offices - the idle chat in the press gallery offices in parliament or at Independent headquarters in Kensington.We learned a lot more about the virus, and a lot more about how much we still don't know. There is a large and strident group of people on Twitter who are convinced that the government should have ignored Whitty's advice and shut the country down sooner. (Spending most of my time on Twitter is something that hasn't changed in lockdown.) But it is also possible that we will end up discovering that many aspects of the lockdown didn't make much difference to the spread of the virus.One thing some people are very sure about is that we weren't ready. At least, they are very sure about that now. I want to listen only to the ones who knew in January what we weren't ready for. For a while after the prime minister told us many of our loved ones would die we thought we needed ventilators, and for a few days - or it may have been weeks - journalists were intent on asking questions about how many we had, how many were coming and why they hadn't been ordered months ago. Then it turned out that we didn't need so many ventilators and that we wanted medical gowns and testing kits. And we still don't know if face masks make a significant difference or not.Like most people, I find it hard to accept that some things are not known. Instead of my list of possible articles, I now have a list of questions about the virus and about the economics of recovering from the pandemic recession. I try to find answers, but I try also to reconcile myself to uncertainty.Meanwhile, I enjoy the quiet, the empty streets, the absence of planes, and the birdsong.",Newspaper

Here are the main points.•Matt Hancock, the health secretary, said that from tonight contact tracing will go live in the Isle of Wight. A new government app that will alert people if they have been in contact with someone who has tested positive for coronavirus is being piloted on the island, and Hancock urged islanders to dowload it. He said:Last week we put in place the testing capability on the island, from tonight the contact tracing capability will go live and from tomorrow NHS staff on the island will be able to download the app. From Thursday, each one of the 80,000 households on the island will get a letter from the chief nurse with comprehensive information about the trial. Islanders will then be able to install the app.Addressing islanders directly, he said:By downloading the app you are protecting your own health, you are protecting the health of your loved ones and the health of your community.•Hancock said he would hire more than the 18,000 contact tracers already being recruited if necessary. That was just the initial number being trained this month to operate contact tracing on a national basis, he said. He went on:There is no magic around the 18,000 figure, that is the initial scale that we think is necessary.If it needs to be bigger, when we find out from the ONS survey that is in the field at the moment what the prevalence of the disease is - the number of new cases per day actually out there rather than that we find through positive tests - then we will adjust that figure.•He said, although the contact tracing scheme would help the government to suppress the coronavirus, the national system did not have to be in place before lockdown measures could be eased. He said:We haven't said we can't make changes [to lockdown] before [contact tracing] is up and running. It is just that the test, track and trace system will help us get R [the reproduction number] down and the lower the number of new cases, the more effective it will be.•He said that 85,186 coronavirus tests were carried out in the 24 hours to 9am this morning. That means, for the second day in a row, the government has failed to hit the target of 100,000 tests a day set for the end of April.•Prof Jonathan Van-Tam, the deputy chief medical officer for England, said that it would take some time before scientists find out whether people who have had coronavirus develop immunity. But ""the overwhelming majority"" of people who have had it have antibodies, a precursor for immunity, he said. Hancock revealed that, as someone who has had the illness himself, he is taking part in trials to check his antibody levels. But he said he would not feel confident going into a crowded room because he could not assume he was immune. And he could not make policy yet on the basis that people with the antibody are immune, he said. (See 5.45pm and 5.47pm.)•Van-Tam said the number of new cases of coronavirus was still too high.

As at 5pm on Sunday, 357 prisoners have tested positive for the virus across 73 prisons, a 3% rise in the three days since the last update, while the number of infected prison staff rose by 6% to 395 workers across 67 prisons in the same period. A total of 13 prisoner and custody services have tested positive. The figures include those who have recovered.

Despite their extremely draconian nature, the regulations are secondary legislation, and they were introduced under a procedure that meant they became law before MPs had voted on them. Sir Graham Brady, the chair of the Conservative backbench 1922 Committee, used his speech to urge ministers to lift the current lockdown measures ""as quickly as possible"". He said:I hope that as ministers approach the second 21-day review they will do so always with a view to removing restrictions and removing these arbitrary rules and limitations on freedom as quickly as possible.It will become even more important that we rely on common sense and voluntary cooperation rather than arbitrary rules.Referring specifically to the rules affecting the over-70s (see 9.43am), he went on:We have today the most healthiest, active elderly generation of all time and it would be tragic if government threatened this by trying to extend a so-called lockdown for those judged to be most at risk based on age. Why don't we just give them the best information and advice and let them limit their risk themselves?block-time updated-timeUpdated at 7.17pm BSTblock-time published-time 6.19pm BST People involved in a study to track coronavirus in the general population have been reporting issues with testing, saying they have been booking appointments that no one turns up to.Some 20,000 households in England have been contacted to take part in a study which aims to improve understanding of infection levels and how many people may have immunity to the virus.All participants have to provide a nose and throat swab to test for whether or not they currently have the virus, while adults in some 1,000 of the households will provide a blood sample to find out what proportion of the population has developed antibodies to Covid-19.One of those selected, Will Murray, said: ""We were meant to have appointments booked last week but no one turned up. We had to contact IQVIA again who assured us someone would turn up to take our blood and swabs the next day. Again, they didn't.""Bernie Spratt said: ""We replied to the invitation on 23 April and were given a home visit date of 27 April when an IQVIA nurse would arrive and test us both. Nobody arrived so we phoned the study contact line and rebooked for Thursday the 30th. Once again nobody arrived so we re-booked for Saturday 2 May. Saturday came and went and so I rang the study contact line again this morning and was told that the reason for the 'no shows' was that there were no test kits available in our area (Shipston on Stour).""The study involves the University of Oxford, data science company IQVIA UK and the National Biosample Centre in Milton Keynes. IQVIA have been fielding responses today on social media from people in a similar situation.The Office for National Statistics, which alongside the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) is leading the study, said: ""We were aware of this issue via the social media activity and have been getting it sorted out this afternoon.""It added that it already had some initial findings which had been shared with the government.block-time updated-timeUpdated at 7.11pm BSTblock-time published-time 6.10pm BST Michael Gove has acknowledged that a new international effort to find a coronavirus vaccine, led by the EU, was not a Boris Johnson initiative, despite front-page reports today. The Daily Express was one of a number of national newspapers to carry the prime minister's call for the world to work together to find a cure for Covid-19 on their front pages, with its headline reading: ""Boris leads £6bn global race for vaccine."" Responding to a question from Labour's Paul Blomfield, Gove told parliament: ""We will cooperate not just with our European neighbours but with other countries in the fight against Covid-19. He's right to say the prime minister is joining the call today in order to ensure that we can support the effort to secure a vaccine. The effort to secure a vaccine is necessarily an international one."" Blomfield asked Gove if, given the UK's involvement with the EU's initiative, the government would be joining the bloc's early warning and response system (EWRS) for pandemics, and the European Medicines Agency (EMA).            The Guardian reported this weekend that the British government was quietly seeking to access the EWRS, despite early reluctance to cooperate on health after Brexit. Gove dodged the question about the EWRS, but said: ""We will of course look pragmatically at how we can co-operate with our European friends and partners. But participation in the EMA would involve, certainly at the moment, the acceptance of the ECJ (European court of justice) oversight and that's not something that the British people voted to do."" Commenting on Gove's response, Blomfield said. ""Michael Gove was right to recognise this international partnership to find a coronavirus vaccine as an EU initiative and not a Boris Johnson project as claimed by some of the Conservative press. But he should also pledge to join the EU's pandemic early warning system, as the NHS wants, and think again about leaving the European Medicines Agency."" Updated at 7.16pm BST5.57pm BSTQ: Given the lockdown still applies on the Isle of Wight, will it generate enough data for the app?Hancock says he thinks it will. There is a busy hospital on the island. And new cases are occurring, he says.He says test, track and trace will be more effective when there are fewer cases.And that's it. The press conference is over.I'll post a summary soon.5.55pm BSTQ: Can you assure people from the Isle of Wight that there data will be safe?Yes, says Hancock.He says the app has been designed with privacy in mind. It has been signed off by the national cyber security centre. The data is stored on your phone, until it needs to contact other people. The highest level of privacy is built in, he says.Newton says the app itself does not hold personal information. He goes on:It is a very safe use of data and people should feel reassured by all the precautions that have been taken.5.53pm BSTQ: Last year you said there was a strong argument for making vaccines compulsory for children going to school. Would that apply to a coronavirus vaccine?Hancock says the public reaction to the lockdown suggests there would be ""very, very high"" levels of take-up without compulsion.He does not rule anything out, he says. But he is proceeding on the basis that compulsion would not be necessary.Van-Tam says it is ""more likely than not"" that the first vaccines will be licensed for adults. He says it is the elderly, not children, who are mot at risk of death.Q: So what is your message to anti-vaxxers?Hancock says coronavirus shows how essential vaccines can be. Vaccines will only be licensed if they are safe.Q: What do you make of research suggesting a link between air pollution and susceptibility to coronavirus?Van-Tam says there is already extensive evidence that air pollution contributes to other illnesses. He has not looked at the link with coronavirus, but he finds the link entirely plausible.5.47pm BSTQ: You probably have antibodies. Would you feel happy going into a crowded room?Not yet, says Hancock.He says he hopes that people with antibodies will have a low rise of transmitting the disease, and a low risk of getting it. That is normally the case with coronaviruses.But he does not know yet. So he cannot base policy on that, he says.Updated at 5.47pm BST5.45pm BSTQ: How has your understanding of immunity developed?Hancock says there are surveys taking place looking at how many people have antibodies.The test shows if antibodies are there. The next phase will be to know what impact those have on someone not getting the illness again. The science on that is getting clearer, he says.Van-Tam  says they need to find out if people to get antibodies after having the illness. Some research is underway. The ""overwhelming majority"" of people who have had Covid have antibodies in their bloodstream.Do those antibodies protect you from further infections? Van-Tam says we just don't know yet. But he says he hopes the answer will be yes.The next question is, how long do those antibodies last? With other coronaviruses, antibodies do not persist for years and years and years. He says we do not know yet if that is the case with Covid-19. But a ""massive"" piece of work is underway to find out. He says they cannot make the science go any faster. They just have to be patient.But, when they do have the answers, antibody testing could be an essential part of the strategy.Hancock says he is in one of these trials. He had coronavirus. And his blood is regularly tested to see if he is developing antibodies.Q: How low do you have to get transmission rates?Hancock says he cannot put a figure on that.5.38pm BSTQ: Some Isle of Wight Radio listeners are worried social distancing will be lifted early on the island because of the pilot.Hancock says there are no plans to lift the social distancing measures early on the island. The plan is to ease the restrictions at the same pace everywhere, he says.5.36pm BSTQ: [From Isle of Wight radio] We ran a poll today showing 80% of listeners said they would install the app. But the island has an elderly population. Why was the island chosen?Hancock welcomes the 80% poll result. The more people download the app, the better, he says.But he accepts that not everyone has a smartphone on the Isle of Wight.But that is another reason for choosing the island, he says. If you tested it somewhere were everyone had a smartphone, that might be too easy, he says.Newton says the island is very suitable. Travel on and off the island is relatively restricted, he says.And he says some elderly people are tech-savvy.He also says people do not need the app to benefit.The people most likely to be mobile will be the people most likely to have a smartphone, he says.5.32pm BSTQ: The most successful contact tracing systems rely on people, as well as technology. Are you putting too much faith in an app?Hancock says he accepts that the part played by people, the contact tracers and members of the public, is vital.Prof John Newton from Public Health England agrees. He says ""shoe leather epidemiology"", having people on the streets, is essential too.He says he hopes the Isle of Wight pilot will provide useful lessons.Q: Isn't it hard to pilot this when people are social distancing?Hancock does not accept that. There are still new cases, he says. So contact tracing can have an impact.5.27pm BSTQ: How will businesses be able to get PPE if the NHS also needs those supplies?Hancock says the government will make sure the NHS take priority.He says this factor will be taken into account as the government considers the way forward.5.26pm BSTHancock  says the government is making rapid progress in recruiting its 18,000 contact tracers.The first ones will start work this week, as they deal with the Isle of Wight. But there is no magic about 18,000, he says. If more are needed, the government will hire them.5.25pm BSTHancock reads out a question from Conrad from Ashford. He asks if the aim is to suppress the virus, or to keep it at manageable levels.Hancock says the aim is to keep the numbers down. Test, track and trace becomes more effective these less transmission there is. The goal is not just to flatten the curve. It is to keep pushing it down. He says he wants to keep the reproduction number below 1.5.23pm BSTHancock  is now taking questions from members of the public.The first is from a man who asks what is being done to protect BAME workers in the NHS.Hancock says a disproportionate number of NHS and care workers from a BAME background have died. He pays tribute to them. He says a programme has been put in place to help address this.Van-Tam  says the NHS is taking this ""incredibly seriously"". A large programme of work has been put in place.

He said he does not want to ""lose the opportunity that we have here and see those people drift back onto the streets when the lockdown starts to be eased in due course"". But he said there is a limited capacity of ""good quality move-on accommodation"" for the more than 5,000 rough sleepers currently being put up in places such as hotels. He said: ""What we will do in the days and weeks ahead is assess what the capacity is in accommodation of that nature, how we can build more capacity at pace, what other accommodation is available on an interim basis, some of which will, I think unfortunately, be more basic, such as hostels and night shelters, simply because there isn't sufficient of the type of accommodation we all want to be available, and then see how we can have a national strategy to try to move as many people as possible into that sort of accommodation and wrap care around them as well, because this is not simply a housing challenge, it's one of mental health and addiction as well.""4.40pm BSTThe work and pensions secretary, Thérèse Coffey,  has been updating MPs on her department's work in tackling the economic impact of the Covid-19 crisis. She said the ""hidden heroes"" in her department had processed an extraordinary 1.8m new claims for universal credit (UC) since mid-March - as well as 250,000 claims for jobseekers' allowance (JSA), and 20,000 for employment support allowance (ESA).Job centres have been closed and turned into claim processing centres, Coffey said, and hundreds of civil servants have been redeployed from other departments. The number of new applications has now ""stabilised"", at 20,000 to 25,000 a day.Coffey's shadow counterpart, Jonathan Reynolds, one of several opposition frontbenchers making their debut today, called for ""legacy benefits"" such as JSA and ESA to be increased for a year, to help claimants through the crisis, as UC has been.Coffey said that was not possible, saying that the complexity of the computer systems used to administer those benefits means that it takes ""quite some time"" to make changes - by which she said she meant months.Updated at 4.46pm BST4.31pm BSTHere are the latest figures on take-up of the government's coronavirus job retention scheme, the initiative that allows employees to be ""furloughed"" on 80% of wages, up to £2,500 per month.

He explains:The real concern is our capacity to act on the results of the tests. Simply doing tests in response to demand will be inadequate. Instead we must use each result to find cases, trace those who have been in contact with a person who has tested positive and ensure that those infected, or potentially infected, self-isolate. Only these four steps used in conjunction will prevent a second wave of the virus and protect vulnerable people.The full article is here.Related: The 100,000 tests plan misses the point. It's how the results are used that matters | Paul Hunter4.17pm BSTMatthew Gould, head of the NHS's digital arm, has defended his agency's choice of a ""centralised"" contact-tracing app as opposed to the type of decentralised system chosen by many other European countries.Speaking over a videolink to MPs and peers on parliament's joint committee on human rights, Gould, the head of NHSX, said: If the only thing we were optimising for [were privacy] it may well be that decentralised system would be the default choice but we are balancing privacy with the need for public health to get insight into what is happening.. [to learn] what contacts are most risky, what is the difference [in exposure] three days before symptoms or one day.A centralised system gives us the chance to get important data about the virus that will help us, he added. The type of system could be altered. ""Just because we have started down one route doesn't mean we are locked into it,"" Gould said.He acknowledged there could be difficulties on the island of Ireland where the government in Dublin has chosen a non-centralised system. ""We are about interoperability,"" Gould insisted. ""The French are taking a similar approach [to the UK].It should not be possible to identify individuals from the data sent to the centralised system, Gould noted. ""We have said very clearly that data will only be used for public health purposes. It will not be used for law enforcement.""Elizabeth Denham, the UK information commissioner, denied that her office was compromised by having been involved at an early stage with NHSX as it developed the system. She told peers and MPs that her office would still be able to carry out its independent oversight responsibilities.Updated at 4.34pm BST4.15pm BSTVisits to council rubbish dumps could be restricted by booking system, Jenrick suggestsCouncils could restrict access to rubbish tips by only allowing cars with particular number plates to visit on a given day, the local government secretary has said. Robert Jenrick said: My view has been that local councils should reopen their waste and recycling sites. We all know the pressure that's building up in some people's homes, particularly those people who live in flats and apartments, without very much space, having bin bags and recycling and boxes from deliveries building up is both a challenge in terms of space but also a public health issue that needs to be resolved.He said an ""orderly reopening"" of sites was possible in most areas and guidance was being updated to class a trip to the tip as a ""necessary journey"". There are ways in which councils can manage demand, by asking people to come with different registration plates on their cars or booking appointments and so on. There are options available to councils if they are concerned about long queues.Updated at 4.37pm BST4.12pm BSTIFS suggests government should offer subsidies for home workingAlthough the UK government has yet to produced details of its plan to relax the lockdown restriction (the term ""exit strategy"" has apparently been banned by No 10, and given that there may never be an exit in the sense of a return to the status quo ante, perhaps they've got a point), that has not stopped lots of other people and organisations having a go. The Scottish government and the Welsh government have published outline proposals, here (pdf) and            here respectively. The former prime minister Tony Blair has released at least three papers on the topic (            here,            here and            here ). The Institute for Government, a thinktank, has produced            its own blueprint. And now the Institute for Fiscal Studies, the public spending thinktank, has also offered its thoughts on the topic.In a 23-page paper (pdf), it floats the idea of offering firms subsidiesto get employees to work from home. Here is an extract.As lockdown is eased, ensuring that those who could work from home reasonably productively are doing so should be a policy priority. It dampens the trade-off between the level of economic activity and the rate of virus transmission. It benefits not only those who can work from home; it also enables more of those who cannot work from home to go to work, without society once again seeing a spike in virus infections large enough to precipitate the re-introduction of lockdown which would once again threaten their livelihoods. But there is obvious potential for market failure here resulting in insufficient working from home. Some of the benefits from doing so accrue not to the individuals or firms themselves but to others in society (through lower virus transmission); and working from home may require investments and adaptations that the uncertain environment could inhibit...Potential policy levers include: Subsidies for firms or workers who are operating from home. The theoretical case for these is clear, given the externalities, though the practical design could be challenging, e.g. to avoid large deadweight.Norm-setting. Simply sending a strong signal that certain sectors or occupations are expected to work from home, and that failing to do so is deemed unacceptable and irresponsible, may have a significant effect. There is a summary of the IFS paper here.4.02pm BSTA report from a multidisciplinary group convened by the Royal Society called Delve - Data Evaluation and Learning for Viral Epidemics - has weighed up the evidence and come out in favour of the public wearing facemasks, including homemade cloth coverings, in a bid to tackle covid-19. It says: Our analysis suggests that their use could reduce onward transmission by asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic wearers if widely used in situations where physical distancing is not possible or predictable, contrasting to the standard use of masks for the protection of wearers.If correctly used on this basis, face masks, including homemade cloth masks, can contribute to reducing viral transmission.However the report stresses clear instructions should be given to the public, including that the wearing of masks is to protect others, rather than the wearer themselves, as well as information on reuse, and the importance of other measures such as washing hands. While there has been some concern that masks may cause some to become complacent, the authors say there is no evidence for this.  ""While there is anecdotal evidence of individual risk compensation behaviour, at a population level the introduction of safety measures like HIV prevention measures, seatbelts and helmets have led to increased safety and even increased safety oriented behaviour,"" they write. ""There is no evidence for individual risk compensation amongst the public during epidemics."" However, the team say more resear...",Newspaper

The announcement on Thursday 16 April came hours after Mr Raab chaired a Cobra meeting to discuss the current social restrictions in place.The extension has been put in place for ""at least"" three weeks which will take the UK to May 7, when we can expect a second review.Mr Raab, who deputised for Boris Johnson, said the Government was being ""as open as we responsibly can at this stage"". ""It would not be responsible to prejudge the evidence that Sage will have and review in just a few weeks' time.""The Foreign Secretary said the Government carefully followed what is happening in other countries but ""we've got to do what is right for the British people based on the advice of our experts, grounded in the conditions prevailing here in the UK"".He said that measures put in place had been successful but that SAGE said that some settings were still seeing infections spreading.He warned that relaxing social restrictions now would damage economy in the longterm.•: How other countries are ending lockdown                     Is lockdown working?                     Less than 12 hours after the Prime Minister's historic address to the nation on March 23, the London Underground was jammed with commuters (see video below), while builders were seen eating together in communal canteens, making a mockery of the Government's rule that no more than two people can gather together in public.Professor Susan Michie, Director of the University College London's Centre for Behaviour Change, warned that some people would simply not be able to carry out the measures, even if they wanted to.""Five million self-employed people are being left potentially destitute by the Government failing to offer financial supportas they have done for directly employed workers,"" she said. ""Since [statutory sick pay of] £94 is not enough to pay rent, bills, food for a family etc, they will be forced to carry on as usual.""The British Transport Police is now on hand to make sure only            critical workers are using the London Underground. But such an inauspicious start to the lockdown suggests the virus will spread further than it would have, had stricter measures been implemented earlier,            as they have in other countries. And it means that the measures we do have are likely to be in place for longer to ""flatten the curve"" in a way that would prevent a second dangerous peak.In addition, on April 1 the Government revealed figures that suggested the lockdown was starting to fray as data showed an ""uptick""            in the number of people using transport.The number of those using their cars and public transport, which had been consistently dropping since strict social distancing measures were introduced, rose for the first time.It is feared that sunny weather will prompt more people to break the rules and go outside to socialise as boredom kicks in.•: Can I go for a drive during lockdown?How long will lockdown last?Mr Raab said the Government needed to be satisfied of five things before it would consider it safe to adjust any of the current measures:•Protect the NHS's ability to cope and be confident that the NHS is able to provide sufficient critical care across the UK.•See a sustained and consistent fall in daily death rates to be confident the UK is beyond the peak.•Reliable data from Sage showing rate of infection is decreasing to manageable levels across the board.•Confident that testing capacity and PPE are in hand with supply able to meet future demand.•Confident that any adjustments to the current measures would not risk a second peak in infections which would overwhelm the NHS.When the lockdown was first announced, Professor Mark Woolhouse, Professor of Infectious Disease Epidemiology, University of Edinburgh, said: ""We now enter a phase of careful monitoring. We are looking for indicators first that the epidemic is slowing down and then for numbers of new cases to start to fall. ""After three weeks we will have to decide whether the restrictions need to be continued, can be relaxed, or can be relaxed temporarily with the expectation of imposing them again later. ""We must also monitor the damage that the lockdown is doing; damage to the economy, to education, to psychological well-being and to health and social care provision in the community. The impacts of this epidemic are too far reaching for policy decisions to be driven by epidemiology alone.""Professor Sheila Bird said that more cases in coming weeks would make it easier for the Government to predict how the epidemic is responding to lockdown measures, which will inform how long they remain in place. ""Once an epidemic takes hold, as now in UK, the country's own data - properly reported and interpreted - take precedence over modelling as the data tell us the actual toll which the epidemic is exacting,"" she said.""A huge amount can be inferred about the immediately forthcoming weeks from these data directly, including whether further policy changes are needed to reinforce social-distancing; for example in particular age groups.""Some experts are still concerned that the current restrictions do not go far enough while others say the government has been hit by an ""epidemic of action"", and is now bringing in measures that have little rationale. Professor Robert Dingwall, Professor of Sociology, at Nottingham Trent University, wrote in The Telegraph: ""It is another triumph of populism over science, of a capitulation to the demand to 'do something'. ""We are still seeing some notion that 'the people' are selfish and must be bullied and disciplined. ""The people are not selfish; they have behaved in ways that are individually rational but have collectively irrational results.""However Dr Andrea Collins, Senior Clinical Lecturer in Respiratory Medicine at the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine (LSTM), said: ""I believe that they have not quite gone far enough. The 'absolutely' necessary to go to work is still being used by some when it is not required-I think we need permits across controlled areas to go to a workplace.""Recent modelling from the universities of Exeter, Bristol and Warwick suggested that without any measures at all, the epidemic would have peaked around 133 days after first person-to-person transmission in Britain, which happened around February 28. So the lockdown has the potential of curtailing the spread by around seven weeks. A welcome relief for people who could have been facing lockdown for most of the summer.",Newspaper; Web Publication
522,"How rival coronavirus science advisors compare to the government's position;The newly formed ""Independent SAGE"" group was formed after the government repeatedly failed to publish the official advisory body's scientific advice","May 4, 2020 Monday",International,mirror.co.uk,1517,1517,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,"By, Oliver Milne","How rival coronavirus science advisors compare to the government's positionThe newly formed ""Independent SAGE"" group was formed after the government repeatedly failed to publish the official advisory body's scientific advice","Britain must ""hope for the best, but plan for the worst-case scenario"" of not finding a vaccine for several years, a rival to the Government's Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies SAGE has heard. The group of top scientists, calling itself the Independent SAGE, was formed after the government repeatedly failed to publish its latest advice amid fears it has been subject to ""dangerous"" political interference.The group of a dozen experts were gathered by Sir David King, a former government chief scientific adviser.He assembled the rival boffins to look at how the UK is handling coronavirus over fears that minister's claim to be ""following the scientific advice"", but have failed to share recent the information behind those decisions with the public.Sir David's group, which held its meeting online, said it has been organised ""in response to concerns over the lack of transparency"" from SAGE after it emerged that Boris Johnson's top aide Dominic Cummings and another Tory aide had attended a meeting in March.It came as Downing Street published the names of the more than 50 scientists who sit on SAGE.                     Scroll down to see how the rival scientists compare to the government position.                   The list of names showed that around half of the experts come from universities and another half is made up of Government chief scientific advisers, public health officials or NHS senior staff.One Google executive, Demis Hassabis, attended ""in a personal capacity as a data scientist,"" the company confirmed after people raised questions over the inclusion of a figure from a private company.Mr Cummings is not listed as a member, despite reports he attended meetings and contributed to discussions.Two members of the group did not give permission for their names to be published.The minutes of the group's meetings have not been released, and neither has the most recent advice which No 10 claims underpins their decisions.The new Independent SAGE group warned that lifting lockdown at different times across the country could lead to anger and resentment.Officials are considering how coronavirus restrictions could be lifted, and later this week Boris Johnson is expected to set out a road map out of the lockdown.They also warned that Britain's strategy could be overly reliant on finding a vaccine.Professor Gabriel Scally, who is President of Epidemiology & Public Health Section of the Royal Society of Medicine, told the committee that we needed to prepare for a vaccine that could be ""several years"" away.Professor Scally, who advises the Irish government, added: ""We can hope for the best, but we must plan for the worst-case scenario and find ways to keep going on that basis and ways to keep our economy and society operational.""Professor Susan Michie warned that lifting certain restrictions for different sections of the economy, areas or age groups risked ""undermining the collective solidarity that has been so important for trust, for adherence, for helping each other"".She added that if specific groups such as the over-70s are asked to stay in lockdown while others are not, the message would have to be much more ""nuanced"".Professor Michie also said the Government must ensure those who are forced to self-isolate, as a result of having contact with someone infected, have financial security.Sir David said the new committee would investigate seven key points, including how successful testing and tracing can be achieved, and what social distancing measures will be needed in future.He said the scientists will share their findings and workings with the public by streaming meetings on YouTube.                     How the rival scientists compare to the government's position                                        Controlling our borders                   The group believes there needs to be a port control policy to stop imported cases of infection.Gabriel Scally, visiting professor of public health at the University of Bristol, said Britain should ""take advantage of its island status"", like New Zealand and Taiwan have, to prevent infected people coming in from abroad.He said: ""Nine out of ten of the world's population live in countries where there are border controls in place because of the virus, yet Britain maintains its open borders policy, which places us in some jeopardy.""He said anyone arriving via our airports, ports and the Eurotunnel should be quarantined for 14 days.                      GOVERNMENT'S POSITION: Open border with travellers arriving in the UK without any checks or quarantine.                     Sending NHS staff to care homes                   Dr Allyson Pollock, a consultant in public health medicine, said that we should be concentrating ""above all"" on the 400,000 residents of care homes around the country.""Many of the deaths in nursing homes were preventable, and people dying alone and without relatives is inhumane and barbaric.""The government could have redeployed staff from quiet bits of the NHS,"" she said.                      GOVERNMENT'S POSITION: Belatedly began supplying care homes with PPE, but support hasn't included deploying NHS staff.                     Looking after ethnic minorities                   Dr Zubaida Haque, deputy director of race equality group the Runnymede Trust, accused the Government of not considering ethnic minority and immigrant groups in Covid-19 planning.She said: ""Minorities are much more likely to be poor and in insecure jobs, and much more likely to live in poor conditions and overcrowded houses.""If those people are at the brink of poverty or have lost jobs, do they have a sufficient safety net The anecdotal evidence is they haven't. Government hasn't really considered them.""The trust also wants the suspension of the rule barring new immigrants and asylum seekers from getting benefits, particularly as they now cannot leave.                     GOVERNMENT'S POSITION: Downing Street has ordered a study into why minorities are at greater risk from Covid-19. No extra financial help and no waiving of ""no recourse to public funds"" for new arrivals.                     Local control of coronavirus fight                   Dr Allyson Pollock believes local government should be given back control of the fight against coronavirus.She said: ""Local government needs to be empowered and enhanced so it can take on public health roles, educational roles, the things that have been decimated and destroyed with billions of pounds worth of cuts over the last 10, 20 years. If we're serious about community involvement we need to rebuild that capacity, including the public health capacity for contact tracing.""                     GOVERNMENT'S POSITION: Central coordination of efforts to control the virus, with many services such as testing and contact-tracing centres run by private firms.                     Waiting for a vaccine                   Prof Deenan Pillay, professor of Virology at UCL and a former SAGE member, stresses that we need a wider range of long-term strategies to contain the virus.He said: ""It is the mantra that we need to somehow survive until a vaccine becomes available.""Not only is there uncertainty around that, but even when a vaccine becomes available, that vaccine does not infer 100% protection in everyone who is given it.""We have to be thinking about a long-term pandemic -with ups and downs for maybe years to come.""                     GOVERNMENT'S POSITION: Chief Medical Officer Chris Whitty has said the pandemic will be over only when we have access to either a ""highly effective"" vaccine or drugs.                     Antibody tests                   Karl Friston, computational modeller at University College London, said that finding out how many people are immune to the virus should be ""the prime focus"" of the coronavirus exit strategy.He said that if, as some American studies suggest, 50% of the population have already had the disease, and if another large portion of the population, including children, are resistant to infection, then so-called ""herd immunity"" would already have been reached and a new wave of the virus would be unlikely. But without data there is no way to be sure.                     GOVERNMENT'S POSITION: Roche Diagnostics says it's in talks with the NHS and the Government about rolling out 100% accurate antibody tests from mid-May.                     Critical care staffing                   Dr Alison Pittard, dean of the Faculty of Intensive Care Medicine, said the only way the NHS has managed to cope with the surge in critical care patients is by staff working overtime, and by bringing in non-critical care workers. Saying critical care is understaffed, she added: ""We already start off in England with a very low number of critical care beds compared with the rest of Europe, so we're not starting from a good point.""                     GOVERNMENT'S POSITION: No plans to increase critical care capacity beyond the large increases in the NHS Nightingale hospitals, which are designed to deal specifically with Covid patients but can't stay open for general use.",Newspaper; Web Publication
523,Scientific group to rival Sage starts live-streaming today;Briefing,"May 4, 2020 Monday",International,The Daily Telegraph (London),357,357,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,Henry Bodkin,Scientific group to rival Sage starts live-streaming todayBriefing,"A RIVAL Sage committee will today back the public use of face masks in a live-streamed meeting designed to embarrass the Government for its alleged lack of transparency.Chaired by Professor Sir David King, the chief scientific adviser from 2000 to 2007, the group will stage a press conference to be broadcast on You-Tube just before the daily Downing Street briefing, in which it will present the evidence for a quicker end to the lockdown.The committee has been established following criticism that the membership of the Government's Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies, and the advice it gives to ministers, is broadly secret. The rival group will include experts from countries that are beginning to lift restrictions while keeping the virus at bay, as well as a former World Health Organisation director and a sitting adviser.Sir David has also poached Professor Susan Michie, a sitting member of Sage's behavioural psychology subcommittee, in a move likely to increase pressure on Boris Johnson to set out the full reasoning behind his stance on the lockdown.The public meeting, broadcast from midday, is expected to highlight evidence from Austria linking the fall in the rate of coronavirus transmission with the public use of face masks.In his first Downing Street press conference since returning from illness last Thursday, Mr Johnson appeared to signal a change in government thinking on the issue when he described face coverings as ""useful"" because they give people the confidence to go back to work. Government scientists are understood to think the evidence supporting the use of face masks by the public is marginal.Sir David told The Telegraph: ""We want to help the Government, but there has to be an improvement in the public discussion. We need to show that there is a different way of doing things, that transparency is the way to win public trust, not having ministers endlessly saying that at no stage have they made any mistakes.""The transparency of Sage's decisionmaking process has attracted mounting disquiet in recent weeks, including the revelation that 16 of the 23 known members are employed by the Government.",Newspaper

526,The government coronavirus advice kept secret until now,"May 5, 2020 Tuesday",International,thetimes.co.uk,1439,1439,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,"Rhys Blakely, Science Correspondent",The government coronavirus advice kept secret until now,"After calls for greater transparency the government published more of the guidance from the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) that has informed its response to the pandemic.                   GRADING ACTIVITIES BY RISK                   By April 1, two months after Britain's first confirmed cases of Covid-19, the experts could see evidence that the outbreak was waning. ""We are aware that modelling colleagues estimate that the changes already in place have probably reduced R to below 1,"" a subcommittee of behavioural scientists known as SPI-B, which feeds into Sage, said. That would mean that each infected person was resulting in less than one new case.The SPI-B panel still advocated rigorous restrictions, however. Measures should be considered to stop vulnerable people being employed in ""high-risk environments"", it said. A sudden resurgence of the virus would be seen as ""a serious failure of policy and trust in public health advice will be lost"".The panel backed a cautious and incremental exit from lockdown, possibly involving ""rapid pilot trials"" of looser restrictions in less-affected areas. The ""simple rules"" of lockdown would have to be replaced by more complicated messaging, it said. Day-to-day activities could be graded according to risk, following the ""traffic light"" system used to promote healthy foods. It suggested a public education campaign in which activities were graded as ""high-risk (avoid), medium (do rarely and carefully) and low (do freely)"".                   JOHNSON SHAKES OFF ADVICE                   On March 3 SPI-B had cautioned against close physical contact. ""Government should advise against greetings such as shaking hands and hugging, given existing evidence about the importance of hand hygiene,"" the panel said. On the same day Boris Johnson told a No 10 press conference that he was still shaking hands. ""People obviously can make up their own minds but I think the scientific evidence is, our judgment is, that washing your hands is the crucial thing,"" he said.                   FEARS OF PUBLIC COMPLACENCY                   On March 12 Sir Patrick Vallance, the chief scientific adviser, spoke to Sky News about the potential advantages of people becoming infected and immune. By March 23 - when lockdown was imposed - he was wrestling with how to impress on the public just how dangerous Covid-19 had proven to be. ""A substantial number of people still do not feel sufficiently personally threatened,"" SPI-B said. ""The perceived level of personal threat needs to be increased among those who are complacent, using hard-hitting emotional messaging.Earlier government messaging had been a mistake. ""There seems to be insufficient understanding of, or feelings of responsibility about, people's role in transmitting the infection to others. This may have resulted in part from messaging around the low level of risk to most people and talk of the desirability of building 'herd immunity' .""There was criticism of advice given to vulnerable people to self-isolate. ""The guidance is vague,"" the scientists said. ""The phrase 'aim to' is too weak - the guidance should promote action not aims."" People had been told to wipe down surfaces but official advice had not told them to use disinfectant.                   DARK FORECASTS FOR THE NHS                   On March 20 the SPI-M-O committee, which includes specialists on flu epidemics, said: ""It is very likely we will see ICU capacity in London breached by the end of the month, even if additional measures are put in place today."" The rest of the country was one to two weeks behind. ""In the absence of additional measures being put into place in the next few days, it is likely that we will breach ICU capacity in other regions.""This was in a report to Sage, not to ministers. Earlier in March the scientists estimated that 12 per cent of people ill enough to be admitted to hospital with Covid-19 would die. The latest data shows a proportion of 33 per cent.                   DOUBTS ON IMMUNITY PASSPORTS                   On April 13 SPI-B voiced concerns over the idea, floated by Matt Hancock, the health secretary, on April 1, that ""immunity passports"" could be used to allow some people to leave lockdown. Tests would have to be 98 per cent accurate to be approved by the regulator. Even then, large numbers of people would be given inaccurate results. The panel also warned that the system could lead to a black market in fake test results. ""If a test result is a requirement for a resumption of work, strategies to 'game' the system may arise,"" it said. ""These include people deliberately seeking out infection or attempting to purchase a fake test result, commercial organisations selling unapproved tests, or approved tests becoming available through private organisations at prices that make them unavailable to most.""It also warned that ""some employers may discriminate on the basis of antibody status"".                   FAIRNESS                   The scientists often observed that the poorest and most vulnerable suffer the worst effects of lockdown and disease. They warn of frustration if policies are seen as unfair - if, for instance, particular religious or ethnic groups are prevented from meeting or if sporting events take place behind closed doors but are available on TV to subscribers.They also recognise that Britain is being compared with other countries and a memo dated March 12 suggested frustration at the pace of ministers. ""SPI-B has pointed out repeatedly that trust will be lost in sections of the public if measures witnessed in other countries are not adopted in the UK and that not pursuing such routes needs to be well explained.""                   THE SCHOOLS DILEMMA                   On March 2 the scientific advisers said that the epidemic seen in Wuhan was ""inconsistent with no transmission from/to children"". Specialists on respiratory diseases advised that ""school closures are likely to impact transmission [of Covid], although significantly less than with flu"".On March 4, however, SPI-B voiced concern over a potential public backlash. ""School closures will be highly disruptive and likely to present an unequal burden to different sections of society,"" the panel said. It pointed to Japan, where it said the policy was giving rise to growing discontent. On March 14, the closure of schools and ""social distancing of over-65s"" were listed as only two measures with ""high confidence"" of limiting transmission of Covid-19. Three days later SPI-B said that it had ""not found a robust academic evidence base relating to the acceptability or social impact of dismissal v closure"".By March 17 and 18 Sage was grappling with locking down the capital. Concerns had been raised that restrictions there would cause people to flee, seeding the virus elsewhere. ""Seeding should not be a concern as infections are already present outside London,"" it said. It was agreed the biggest impact would be ""closing schools, colleges and universities; stopping leisure activities, including bars, restaurants and theatres; closing places of work"".Schools in England and Wales shut on March 20.                   Analysis                   Just how much ministers' response to the coronavirus has been driven by judgments on how the public would react is clear from the Sage documents published yesterday (Chris Smyth writes).Wariness at school closures seems to have been encouraged by reports of discontent at similar policies elsewhere. Even what now seems like a relatively mild policy of quarantine of those with symptoms seems to have been delayed by fears over its unequal social impact.The documents also reveal how the ""stay at home"" message was honed by fears that some people were complacent about the virus. Emotional messaging, stressing a direct personal threat, and appeals to social duty were suggested.This has worked so well that it limits ministers' freedom. Explaining more nuanced measures will be tricky, behavioural scientists concluded after the lockdown began.Those looking for evidence that ministers ignored scientists' warnings will be largely disappointed. Reluctance to lock down earlier can be explained by a conclusion on March 2 that such a policy would probably not reduce the ultimate number of infections. Sage had dramatically underestimated the speed of the spread.The only clear example of scientists suggesting faster action than the government took is a warning on March 20 that even immediate action would not stop London's intensive care units being overwhelmed. The prime minister waited three more days before taking nationwide action.",Newspaper; Web Publication
527,Experts point to border risk and press for transparency;Scientific advice,"May 5, 2020 Tuesday",International,"Financial Times (London, England)",523,523,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,CAMILLA HODGSON,Experts point to border risk and press for transparencyScientific advice,"The UK should consider imposing border controls and prepare for a scenario that does not rely on an effective vaccine for Covid-19, an independent group of scientists said yesterday.The group of experts, including former government advisers, was set up to outline recommendations for ministers, amid calls for greater transparency from the government's official Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies.The group of 12 scientists made a series of recommendations, including publication of more precise data and implementation of a border policy to prevent imported cases of infection.""There are countries that appear to have taken effective advantage of their island status, like New Zealand,"" said Gabriel Scally, president of the Royal Society of Medicine's epidemiology and public health section. The UK had not and was one of the few countries that still had open borders, which ""places us in sudden jeopardy"", he said.After weeks of pressure, Sage published a partial list of its members yesterday, with two choosing to remain anonymous. Dominic Cummings, Boris Johnson's chief adviser, was not listed as having participated in Covid-19 Sage meetings, even though Number 10 has confirmed he had taken part in some. The committee said meetings were ""regularly attended"" by government officials, none of whom was named. The list included Demis Hassabis, founder of Google's DeepMind artificial intelligence arm, scientific advisers from government departments and David Halpern, chief of the Cabinet Office's behavioural insights team. But minutes and evidence behind recommendations were not made public despite calls for them to be so.""When it comes to scientific advice of any kind, transparency is essential,"" said David King, chair of the ""independent Sage"" group and the former chief scientific adviser.The expert group also cautioned ministers not to rely too heavily on the possibility of a vaccine. ""This pandemic has to be managed without really knowing whether or not a vaccine ... can emerge,"" said Sir David. A vaccine ""shouldn't be overstated as a solution"".Public messaging had at times been confusing and the quality and clarity of data about testing, cases and deaths inadequate, the experts agreed. Sir David posed a fundamental question about government strategy: ""Is the objective to suppress the infection or is it in fact to manage the infection?"" To ease some of the uncertainty, the publication of a clear target that must be met before lockdown restrictions could be eased would be helpful, they said.Much has been made of the virus reproduction, or ""R"", number, with government scientists stressing that ""keeping the R down"" is key to unlocking social distancing measures.But Karl Friston, a computational modeller at University College London, said focusing on R ""may not be the best way"" of planning next steps. ""R is only a statistical summary, and what would be more useful is an understanding of the driving factors behind the R - what is causing the infection and its spread.""The committee's full recommendations will be sent to the government and to the House of Commons health and social care committee.",Newspaper

But the documents also show the science is never one clear piece of advice.And in a few cases, the government's action did not match up with what the documents say.For example, scientists appeared to say they were happy with a London-only shutdown of bars and restaurants rather than a UK-wide closure.But the government, after days of debate, went with a UK-wide shutdown instead.Meanwhile, the documents clearly spell out the dangers in the next phase when lockdown begins to ease.They warn any easing of lockdown must be ""very gradual"" -and give people back some of their leisure activities, not just restart the economy.And the scientists warn rogue bosses could exploit any system of ""immunity passports"" to hand riskier jobs to those who've already had Covid-19.                     Here are 9 things we've learned today.                                        1. Boris Johnson imposed lockdown after he was told ICU would fill up in 11 days                   Boris Johnson took his lockdown decision after being warned intensive care beds would fill up in 11 days.A ""consensus view"" on March 20, from the Scientific Pandemic Influenza Group on Modelling, warned the virus was doubling every three to five days.It said: ""It is very likely that we will see ICU capacity in London breached by the end of the month, even if additional measures are put in place today.""The rest of the UK is 1-2 weeks behind London. In the absence of additional measures being put into place in the next few days, it is likely that we will breach ICU capacity in other regions.""The Prime Minister -who had stopped short of a full lockdown -then announced one on March 23.SAGE warned even a lockdown would not stop capacity being breached, because it would take two to three weeks to take effect.But the NHS then announced the first of its Nightingale hospitals on March 24 -which meant the first peak did not exceed intensive care capacity.                     2. Boris Johnson boasted about shaking hands -on the same day scientists said not to                   Boris Johnson boasted he'd shaken hands with ""everybody"" at a hospital -on the same day the advisors agreed handshakes should stop.The Independent Scientific Pandemic Influenza Group on Behaviours, a subcommittee of SAGE, issued its advice on March 3.It said: ""There was agreement that Government should advise against greetings such as shaking hands and hugging, given existing evidence about the importance of hand hygiene.""Promoting a replacement greeting or encouraging others to politely decline a proffered hand-shake may have benefit.""Yet on the same day, Boris Johnson said he had not stopped shaking hands.He told the No10 press conference: ""I was at a hospital the other night where I think a few there were actually coronavirus patients.""And I shook hands with everybody, you'll be pleased to know, and I continue to shake hands.""Mr Johnson later said he'd stopped shaking hands -but only after shaking hands with Phillip Schofield and Anthony Joshua.Downing Street said the PM ""wouldn't have seen"" that specific paper on March 3 and may never have seen it. The document was only a submission to SAGE from its own subcommittee, not a report from SAGE to the government -which are kept secret.                     3. The virus was spreading much faster than the scientists thought                   SAGE admitted in late March that the 'R' number -the number of people each Covid-19 carrier infects -was higher than they first thought.They had previously estimated it at 2.4, but on March 20 admitted ""we cannot rule out it being higher than 3.""That meant it was spreading far faster than the government or the scientists had thought.Chief Scientific Advisor Sir Patrick Vallance has since said the R number was 3 in the early stages.                     4. Scientists lent support to a London-only lockdown -but it didn't happen                   The week of March 15 was gripped by rumours of a ""London lockdown"".These rumours were angrily denied at the time by Downing Street, which correctly said travel in and out of the capital would not be stopped.But actually we now know ""lockdown"" doesn't mean banning all transport. And the documents show the rumours were much closer to the truth than Downing Street would have us believe.SAGE held a discussion on March 17-18 about what it called -in its own words -a ""London lockdown.""The scientists agreed shutting schools, bars, restaurants, theatres and offices would have the greatest effect on transmitting the virus.And they made clear it could be London-only. The summary of the debate said: ""Concerns were raised over whether locking down London would cause people travel and seed the virus in other places.""It was confirmed that seeding in this way should not be a concern as infections are already present outside London.""But Boris Johnson decided not to do this. Instead he announced on March 20 that people should stop going to pubs, restaurants and bars UK-wide. A UK-wide lockdown followed on March 23.Similarly, SAGE evidence on April 1 shows experts suggested regional pilots of lifting the lockdown. But the government is not following this approach. Instead the lockdown will be eased UK-wide -but could be reimposed locally if there's a spike in one area.                     5. Scientists made the government change 'confusing' stay-at-home guidance                   Scientists hit out at the government's ""confusing"" stay-at-home guidance before it was tightened up to herald the UK-wide lockdown.Original advice -now withdrawn -said people should work from home ""where possible"" and ""avoid non-essential use of public transport when possible"".But on March 22, SAGE scientists agreed that was not clear enough to stop people putting themselves at risk.They wrote: ""Phrases such as 'as much as is practicable', 'non-essential', 'significantly limit', and 'gathering' are open to wide differences in interpretation.""This can lead to confusion about exactly what people are being required to do e.g. gathering outside or going for walks. Guidance now needs to be reformulated to be behaviourally specific.""They also said the guidance must be combined with ""hard-hitting emotional messaging"" showing people the ""personal threat"" to their health.                     6. The experts warn the lockdown must only be lifted 'very gradually'                   More recent guidance from April 1 shows scientists agree the lockdown cannot be lifted in a hurry.They say this isn't just because of the health benefits -if there's a second peak, it will undermine the entire public's trust in government advice.The paper was drawn up by the scientific pandemic influenza group on behaviour SPI-B.It says: ""If there is then an increase in infection rates that necessitates a reintroduction of restrictions this is likely to be seen as a serious failure of policy and trust in public health advice will be lost, leading to lower adherence to advice to restrict or to resume activity.""To avoid these problems we would advocate trialling easing restrictions very gradually when epidemiologically indicated.""While clearly explaining why these particular activities are being resumed and how risks must be controlled if these activities are to be maintained.""                     7. Lockdown must not just ease for work -leisure is important too                   In the same meeting on April 1, scientists urged the government to let people return to leisure activities -not just work.""To maintain public trust and support it will be important to have acceptable and equitable criteria for selecting which activities can be resumed,"" they agreed.""For example, it may be difficult to justify easing restrictions solely for economic activities without any easing of restrictions for low risk activities with significant social and psychological benefit.""                     8. 'Immunity passports' could be hijacked by rogue employers -and put staff at risk                   Rogue bosses could give riskier jobs to people who have had Covid-19 -thinking they're immune when they're not, the advisors say.In a paper on April 13, the scientific pandemic influenza group on behaviour SPI-B said employers might ""actively discriminate"" against workers who were not shown to have antibodies.The experts also say any 'immunity passports' -which have not yet been proven to work -could be hijacked by people trying to ""game the system"".It's not yet been proven if having antibodies makes you immune to getting Covid-19 twice. And there is not yet a reliable antibody test available.The government's advice warns even a 2% fail rate could lead to dozens of people in every thousand going back to work, or isolating, with the wrong advice.The note added: ""Some employers may discriminate on the basis of antibody status.""This might include not permitting those testing antibody negative to return to work or only taking on new staff with antibody positive test results.""Work may also be allocated among employees based on test status with, for example, customer-facing work being allocated to those who have tested antibody positive.""In some circumstances this may be appropriate, but in others this might constitute adverse discrimination. This risk applies across all occupational sectors.""The note also warned about the risk of people trying to ""game"" the system by attempting to purchase a fake test result one way or the other.                     9. And finally... 'herd immunity' was discussed                   Some of the behavioural scientists suggested publicising the concept of ""herd immunity"" -to explain why the UK was not imposing social distancing measures in early March.This is highly controversial because government has insisted ""herd immunity"" was never its plan.Instead, they've more described it as a fact of life -the only way to permanently protect the population is through 'herd immunity', either by a vaccine or lots of people getting sick and recovering.But this isn't government policy so they insist because it would lead to hundreds of thousands of deaths.A paper dated March 4, considered by Sage on March 5, said: ""SPI-B scientific pandemic influenza group on behaviours have divergent opinions on the impact of not applying widescale social isolation at the same time as recommending isolation to at-risk groups.""One view is that explaining that members of the community are building some immunity will make this acceptable.""Another view is that recommending isolation to only one section of society risks causing discontent.""

We will need to adjust to a new normal, where we as a society adapt to safe ways to work, to travel, to interact and go about our daily lives.""Mr Raab said that ""we've never experienced anything like this first stage of Covid-19"" in terms of the scale of lives lost and the lockdown ""but it is required"".He added: ""As we go forward, we want to make sure that the next phase is more comfortable, is more sustainable and prevents lasting damage to jobs and livelihoods.""We need to be under no illusions. The next stage won't be easy. It's going to protect life and preserve our way of life. We must continue to be guided by the scientific advice we receive and make sure the next steps that we take are sure-footed and sustainable.""Giving evidence to MPs on the health select committee, Sir Patrick said that people should not be too concerned about walking past others and added that the risk of catching coronavirus outdoors was ""really low"", in a clear sign that open-air work and leisure can safely resume.Earlier this morning he bowed to pressure to make the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) more transparent. Some of the group's documents were published, although some have been redacted.A ""traffic light"" system based on food labelling should be used to communicate the risk of everyday activities as Britain slowly exits lockdown, its behavioural scientists said.Restrictions can be eased only ""very gradually"" to avoid a loss in public confidence if some measures need to be reimposed, added the SPI-B group, Sage's behavioural science sub-group, on April 1.Vulnerable people such as the elderly or those with underlying conditions might no longer be allowed to work in ""high-risk environments"" in the next phase, the document suggests.The documents provide a new insight into concerns that the government's initial messaging was confusing, leading the public to underestimate the threat posed by Covid-19. Those concerns led to the ""Stay at home"" slogan.On March 22, Sage said: ""A substantial number of people still do not feel sufficiently personally threatened; it could be that they are reassured by the low death rate in their demographic group.""It added: ""The perceived level of personal threat needs to be increased among those who are complacent, using hard-hitting emotional messaging. To be effective this must also empower people by making clear the actions they can take to reduce the threat.""Social distancing rules requiring people to stay two metres apart were ""based on a probability"", Sir Patrick told MPs. ""Essentially a minute at 2 metres is about the same risk as 6 seconds at 1m.""He added: ""If you're walking straight past somebody and you're 1.5m apart you've got maybe a second or two when you're close - the probability of something happening in that time is relatively low.""The government is preparing to recommend cloth face coverings in confined spaces as a way of slowing the spread in the next phase and Sir Patrick said that they had a ""marginal positive effect"".He added: ""The risk at 1m is about 10 to 30 times higher than the risk at 2m so the distancing is an important part of this. Where therefore masks may have a role is in situations where distancing is not possible.""Sir Patrick stressed these were decisions for politicians, in a hearing during which he repeatedly stressed that it was up to government, not scientific advisers, to set policy. Despite ministers' insistence that they are led by the science, Sir Patrick said it was more accurate to say ""the government's decisions are based on science informing them"".He said that he doubted Sage had ever given ministers a ""single option"", saying that its advice would usually be ""two or three options to say these are the sorts of things you could consider, here is the reason we think they are reasonable options and here are the uncertainties that lie around those options because nearly everything we are talking about has quite wide uncertainty around it.""Sir Patrick stressed that on many issues relating to coronavirus ""this is not a set of absolute science outcomes that you can say there's the answer without any doubt"" and stressed that there was no certain answer to the question of how to move out of lockdown.""These are judgments which get based on the scientific information, they are not scientific certainties that allow you to make an absolute decision,"" he said. Pointing out that countries as similar as Germany and the Netherlands had come to opposing conclusions on opening schools, he said: ""What we will see is natural experiments taking place as people choose slightly different options.""The government has set five tests for easing lockdown, of which the most stringent is confidence that any changes would not risk a severe second peak.Asked how confident he was about avoiding a second peak, Sir Patrick said: ""If we do test, track and trace well and we keep the social distancing measures at the right level we should be able to avoid a second wave, so I'm at the more optimistic side that you can.""However, he cautioned that ""winter is going to be extremely difficult when you also have flu circulating and all the other respiratory infections which get confused with this"".Care homes and hospitals also risk acting as reservoirs of infection that could restart the epidemic, Sir Patrick said, underlining the importance of stamping on outbreaks in these institutions. ""Control of infection in care homes and in hospitals is critical to the overall control of the epidemic,"" he said.""Care homes and the spread in hospitals are two parts of this epidemic that must be brought under control if we are to get control of the overall thing because otherwise we get reseeding of cases into the community.""Documents released today also make clear that the government's decision in March not to impose a London-only lockdown was a political one based on a desire for the country to act as one, since Sage rejected scientific fears that it would spread the epidemic if people fled the capital.On the Friday before Boris Johnson imposed lockdown, Sage's mathematical modellers concluded: ""It is very likely that we will see ICU capacity in London breached by the end of the month, even if additional measures are put in place today.""Speaking to MPs, Sir Patrick rejected suggestions that Britain was weeks late to lock down, but acknowledged that ""days either way"" could have made a difference.",Newspaper; Web Publication
530,OVER HALF OF SECRET ADVISORY GROUP ON STATE PAY,"May 5, 2020 Tuesday",International,The Daily Mail and Mail on Sunday (London),509,509,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,"BY ELEANOR HAYWARD, VANESSA ALLEN, LIZZIE DEANE AND DAVID CHURCHILL",OVER HALF OF SECRET ADVISORY GROUP ON STATE PAY,"MORE than half the members of the secretive scientific group advising ministers on coronavirus are State employees.The names of 50 experts on the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) were published yesterday amid mounting criticism over a lack of transparency.They include familiar figures such as chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance, chief medical officer Professor Chris Whitty and NHS medical director Professor Stephen Powis.But 28 of those named are employed by the Government, including senior NHS staff, public health officials and civil servants.The rest of the group comprises scientists from leading universities, with expertise in disciplines including infectious diseases, children's health and behavioural science.However, critics have claimed the independence of Sage is jeopardised because too many of its members are employed by the Government.There are also concerns over the potential commercial conflicts of interest of some members.They include Dr Demis Hassabis, a co-founder of Google's artificial intelligence division DeepMind, who has attended Sage meetings in his personal capacity as a data scientist', according to the list published on the Government's website.Last month it emerged that Boris Johnson's controversial political adviser Dominic Cummings has attended Sage meetings. His name was not included in the official list published yesterday, which will fuel speculation that he is one of the two members whose identities remain redacted.Sir David King, who is leading an independent' alternative group to Sage, said: An independent science advisory group really needs to be dominated by people whose income is not determined by the fact they are working for the Government.'A Government Office for Science spokesman said: Permission to publish names was requested from all participants. Those who did not give permission have not been named.'The membership of Sage - which typically meets twice a week - is not fixed and different scientists are invited to different meetings depending on the issue being discussed.Sir Jeremy Farrar, a member of Sage and director of the research charity Wellcome Trust, said 250 people feed into the group and he has never detected any undue influence.High-profile members include Professor Neil Ferguson, from Imperial College London, whose virus modelling predicting up to 500,000 UK deaths led to the lockdown being imposed.NHS employees in the group include Dr Indra Joshi, who is overseeing the introduction of artificial intelligence in the health service.Civil servants attending the meetings include the chief scientific advisers at the Home Office, Department for Transport, Foreign Office and Department for International Development.Science and technology committee chairman Greg Clark welcomed the publication of the list, saying it would provide public reassurance that government decisions are informed by a broad and substantial body of expert advice'.* Latest coronavirus video news, views and expert advice at mailplus.co.uk/coronavirus© Daily Mail",Papers
531,"No 10 scientific advisers warned of black market in fake coronavirus test results;Sage told widespread use of antibody tests could lead to criminal behaviour, papers revealCoronavirus - latest updatesSee all our coronavirus coverage","May 5, 2020 Tuesday",International,The Guardian (London),814,814,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,Ian Sample Science editor,"No 10 scientific advisers warned of black market in fake coronavirus test resultsSage told widespread use of antibody tests could lead to criminal behaviour, papers revealCoronavirus - latest updatesSee all our coronavirus coverage","Downing Street's scientific advisers feared people might intentionally seek to contract coronavirus and that a black market in fake test results could emerge if employers allowed workers to return only when they had a positive antibody test.The Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies, known as Sage, was warned last month by its behavioural psychology subgroup that the widespread introduction of antibody tests could lead to a range of potentially dangerous and even criminal ""negative behavioural responses"" if not handled well.The warning, discussed by Sage on 14 April, is among a tranche of official documents released on Tuesday as part of the government's efforts to be more transparent about the advisory groups and the scientific basis for the advice they are giving ministers.The papers show that: On 4 February, Sage estimated the size of the outbreak in China to be ""at least 10 times higher"" than the official number of confirmed cases. On 3 March, as Boris Johnson described how he "" shook hands with everybody "" on a hospital visit, a Sage subgroup said ministers should advise against greetings ""such as shaking hands and hugging"". On 23 March, the day of the lockdown, Sage discussed how ""hard-hitting"" emotional messaging could be needed to make complacent people feel at risk. Modelling discussed on 23 March predicted London's intensive care unit capacity would be breached by the end of the month. The rapid rise of admissions to intensive care units meant a reproductive rate, R, of more than 3 could not be ruled out. Easing the lockdown must be done extremely carefully and that a ""traffic light system"" could help people understand what activities were high or low risk. Antibody tests are expected to become available in the UK within the next month, but their value is still under debate. While most people who recover from Covid-19 are expected to have antibodies to the virus, it is unclear how protective they will be, and how long any protection will last, making many scientists cautious about ""immunity passports""Experts on the scientific pandemic influenza group on behaviours, Spi-B, which feeds into Sage, explained in April that pre-emptive measures were needed to prevent a range of undesirable outcomes when antibody tests became available.The group described how people who tested positive might get sloppy with hand hygiene and contribute to the spread of the virus, or put themselves forward for jobs that exposed them to infectious people, a particular concern if the test result was faulty.The experts went on to warn that employers might discriminate against staff on the basis of their antibody tests and that if a positive test was needed to return to work, people might ""game"" the system and deliberately seek infection or try and buy fake test results.A second paper from the Spi-B experts warns that any attempt to cycle between periods of lockdown and easing would need to be explained extremely carefully to the public. After months of lockdown, people might assume that any easing of the restrictions meant the risk of infection had gone away. If infections then picked up and further lockdown was ordered, it was ""likely to be seen as a serious failure of policy and trust in public health advice will be lost"".The documents do not provide complete transparency about the Sage group's deliberations, however. The four-page paper from the Spi-B group on easing the lockdown includes more than a page of redacted material.Other papers reveal that the Covid-19 Genomics UK consortium, a group of geneticists charged with understanding the epidemic, swiftly identified 12 lineages of the virus in March, consistent with the virus being imported to the UK from Europe and ""multiple locations around the world"".A further Sage paper agreed that stopping or reducing public transport would have a ""minimal effect"" on slowing the spread of the virus. Concerns that a London lockdown would lead to people leaving the city and spreading the virus elsewhere were dismissed because infections were already present outside the capital.On the day of the nationwide lockdown, 23 March, Sage considered a raft of measures that might be needed to ensure people complied with strict social distancing and the stay-at-home policy. It raised the prospect of new legislation to enforce social distancing and warned that people who were ""complacent"" about the virus needed to feel an increased level of ""personal threat"" which could be achieved using ""hard-hitting emotional messaging.""Asked about the redacted material, a government spokesperson said: ""The only redactions relate to comments made by a SAGE sub-group on the early development of policy still under consideration or to remove contact details. Redactions were carried out by officials working for the Government Office for Science in consultation with the department developing the policy.""",Newspaper
532,Britain is in a state of emergency. So where are its emergency planners?;A pandemic has been warned of for years. But the government's flat-footed response betrays its lack of emergency expertsCoronavirus - latest updatesSee all our coronavirus coverage,"May 5, 2020 Tuesday",International,The Guardian (London),942,942,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,David Alexander,Britain is in a state of emergency. So where are its emergency planners?A pandemic has been warned of for years. But the government's flat-footed response betrays its lack of emergency expertsCoronavirus - latest updatesSee all our coronavirus coverage,"Twelve years ago, I attended a conference on public health where a leading expert on pandemics introduced his talk by saying: ""My task is to tell you things you don't want to know, and ask you to spend money you haven't got on something you don't think will happen."" He then went on to describe, in considerable detail, a scenario for a global pandemic that was eerily similar to the one we're currently experiencing.Fast-forward more than a decade, and it seems the UK government was badly prepared for the coronavirus pandemic. It's not as if we didn't have prior warning that an event like this was a threat. Though Exercise Cygnus of 2016 remains shrouded in mystery, the government's national risk register of civil emergencies has long put pandemics at the top of the list of risks the UK faces. In the 2017 register, a virus symbol sits in the top right-hand corner of a diagram of likelihood versus consequences. The UK's strategy for            managing a pandemic, meanwhile, was first published in 2011. But by 2014, government attention had turned away from pandemic preparation and back to counter-terrorism planning. And by 2016, planners in the UK were fully engaged in confronting the supply-chain disaster that would be Brexit, struggling to figure out how, for example, to            boost the UK's coffee supply.Britain is experienced in planning for pandemics - so where is the emergency management of coronavirus? What we know so far about committees such as the scientific advisory group for emergencies ( S           age ) is that they appear to include no independent advisers on emergency planning and management. Expertise in medicine, virology, epidemiology, statistics and global health are all represented. So are behavioural sciences and psychology. Yet there seems to be a prevailing sense that the coronavirus crisis is primarily a medical and epidemiological problem - and that other aspects are mere fallout.This is not exactly true. Modelling the transmission of the virus, researching a vaccine and procuring antiviral therapies are of course vitally important. But there is more to the coronavirus crisis than flattening its curve. The measures to contain the virus are relatively simple - physical distancing, testing, tracing and isolation - but they are laden with consequences, both for society and for individuals. Anticipating these effects and finding ways to mitigate them are the keystone of emergency planning.The coronavirus crisis is complicated by the fact we are living in a highly interconnected world, where one event can have a ripple effect across the networks on which we all depend. Halting international travel, for example, has left food producers without           seasonal migrant           workers to harvest crops. But the arrival of seasonal workers from abroad in the future could lead to a second spike of infections, particularly if they live in close proximity to one another. The issue of a second spike has already            proved an issue in Singapore, previously lauded for its response to the virus. These are among the types of issues that emergency planners need to consider.Early attempts to deal with the crisis in the UK involved minimising its significance to the public and frantically improvising in a vain attempt to catch up with the spread of the virus. If plans existed, there was an abyss between the decisions mandated by the government and the reality of how they played out on the ground. This underlines the fact that emergency planning must be a live effort. Reality does not stand still - so neither must the plans for dealing with an emergency. Planners should be able to foresee urgent needs and prioritise them, providing enough personal protective equipment to the care homes that have become hotspots for the virus, for example, and knowing in advance how to source such equipment in adequate quantities.Numerous academics have presented fairly detailed scenarios for an influenza pandemic since 2008, which covered many of the social, economic and public health consequences that we are now experiencing. But we still don't have a clear idea about the recovery process, and what actions the government should take to help society and the economy to recover. Although we can look back to the 1918-1920           flu pandemic for an idea of how long this recovery process might take - and the challenges that this period will present - it's difficult to apply this knowledge to the current crisis when so much has changed.Emergency planning isn't rocket science, but it's distinctly challenging on many levels, involving intellectual, scientific and practical decisions. Wherever an event can be foreseen, the plans should be based on a range of scenarios. Planning scenarios aren't predictions of the future but rather systematic explorations of hypothetical situations, answering the question: ""What if...?""When disasters strike there should be three elements to the response: plans, procedures and improvisation. We can imagine the planner as an orchestral conductor, directing the members of the orchestra to play their sheet music. It's the conductor's job to ensure the musicians play in harmony, and although improvisation can't be eliminated, it should be reduced to a bare minimum. Emergency planners will be needed to identify and meet the novel challenges that coronavirus presents - both now and in the future. Never have they been needed more on critical advisory committees.

533,A strong economy also saves lives - and we need to think about both;Comment,"May 5, 2020 Tuesday",International,The Daily Telegraph (London),652,652,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,Iain Duncan,A strong economy also saves lives - and we need to think about bothComment,"Iwrote some three weeks ago that we were fast approaching the moment when we would have to begin unlocking.Already back then it was clear that the British people had imbibed the message of staying at home to protect the NHS and save lives to such a degree that adherence to the lockdown had been more effective than many had believed possible.This response bought time for the NHS to build extra capacity and the resilience it desperately www.needed.No one understands that more than the Prime Minister who, since his own illness, has movingly articulated the desperate fear so many have felt. Yet he also knows time and tide wait for no man and he now faces perhaps the biggest decision of all - whether to unlock now, and how.Confronting him is the fact that at the present rate of government expenditure, the UK is likely to end this year with a fiscal deficit of almost 15 per cent of GDP, far worse than the economic crisis in 2008.Public debt is set to rise above 100 per cent of national income, an all-time high in peacetime, and it's also becoming clear that a quarter of companies have already stopped, while others are in danger of following.Because this has been a global shutdown, the UK's economic output will almost certainly drop by around a third during the second quarter.That is why, although I welcome the Government's statement that they will present a blueprint, I am still concerned about the possibility of further delay, perhaps because polling shows that nearly a third of the public say they don't want to leave lockdown at all and two thirds confess they are worried about leaving home.This fear has in part been shaped by the strong message and the false idea that we face a choice between saving lives and saving the economy. In reality a strong economy also saves lives and we need to think about both - perhaps we should publish the bankruptcy and unemployment figures at the daily conference to help inform people.Yet the recent behaviour of the public should give us confidence about unlocking because it has shown they are more than capable of understanding a clearly explained message. This means we could proceed with ideas such as the plan put forward by the economists Prof Paul Ormerod and Dr Gerard Lyons to unlock different sectors at different rates to restore economic activity while reducing the risk of a second wave.This is why for some weeks I have asked the Government to take the British people into its confidence and to explain the balance of risks. Instead, it has proceeded with the idea that to do so would confuse people and jeopardise the lockdown.A phased approach is the right one, but it needs to be governed not just by medical advice but by behavioural science and economics as well. Several countries are worth looking at, such as Sweden which did not lock down to the same level as the UK. There is also a need to test, track and trace. I note the talk of an app in development, but we must be careful not to damage the economy further by insisting we cannot unlock until such an app is ready. The critical component as we go forward is a clear path that people understand. This would allow them to support the focus on maintaining social distancing and public hygiene.After six weeks of lockdown, we mustn't lose sight of how vital a functioning economy is to our health and wellbeing. Perhaps we should remember President Roosevelt's wise words in a time of crisis: ""The only thing we have to fear is fear itself.""That's why, with determination tempered by care, and by trusting the common sense of the British people, we should start the process of ending the lockdown.Sir Iain Duncan Smith is a former leader of the Conservative Party'The Prime Minister now faces perhaps the biggest decision of all - whether to unlock now, and how''Perhaps we should remind ourselves of Roosevelt's wise words, ""The only thing we have to fear is fear itself "" '",Newspaper

The recommendations come as Boris Johnson prepares to outline a 'roadmap' for coming out of lockdown. The government has already made clear lockdown will only end bit by bit. But the idea of a traffic light system, while raised in Wales, is largely new.The Prime Minister is set to address the nation on Sunday spelling out how schools, offices and some outdoor activities can return.But he is expected to warn social distancing measures must stay in place for many months -quite possibly until next year.In a paper dated April 1 but published today, the scientific pandemic influenza group on behaviour SPI-B said the lockdown must lift ""very gradually"" to avoid a second peak.A second peak would not only cause tens of thousands more deaths -but would lead to more people distrusting government advice.In the paper, the scientists said: ""This is likely to be seen as a serious failure of policy.""Trust in public health advice will be lost, leading to lower adherence to advice to restrict or to resume activity.""They added: ""To avoid these problems we would advocate trialling easing restrictions very gradually.""The scientists recommend a range of approaches -not all of which have been taken up by government.They include trials in ""particular locations"" of easing the lockdown. No10 has not taken this approach -instead opting for a UK-wide easing. But it is considering reimposing local lockdowns if the disease returns.The suggestions also include a ""traffic light"" system.Scientists suggest it could be a good way of boiling down complicated advice to the public.They recommend ""extending public health campaigns"" that already work in other areas.""For example, methods that have been used successfully for helping people understand how to implement other behaviour changes such as healthy eating include providing a 'traffic light' list of examples of high avoid, medium do rarely and carefully and low do freely risk activities.""The scientists said any easing of lockdown would have to happen ""while clearly explaining why these particular activities are being resumed"".They went on: ""This will also allow an opportunity to gather epidemiological evidence about the impact of easing the restriction and be used to provide evidence to the public about the impact of that restriction.""To maintain public trust and support it will be important to have acceptable and equitable criteria for selecting which activities can be resumed.""For example, it may be difficult to justify easing restrictions solely for economic activities without any easing of restrictions for low risk activities with significant social and psychological benefit.""Since the advice was written, concerns have been raised about the focus on the economy -but not protecting people's mental health.It's thought some outdoor leisure activities will be allowed to restart as part of the PM's roadmap out of lockdown on Sunday.",Newspaper; Web Publication

Getting out of lockdown                    A ""traffic light"" system advising the public about the risks of different activities could be used to ease the lockdown, the Government's scientific advisers have said. The proposals, drawn up last month, suggest changes should be made ""very gradually"" and warns against relaxing rules for workplaces without allowing social activities to resume. It says the abrupt lifting of social distancing measures and a subsequent increase in coronavirus infections could undermine public trust in health policy and mean people are less likely to comply with future demands. The paper was drawn up by the scientific pandemic influenza group on behaviour (SPI-B), and considered by Sage at its April 2 meeting.The documents are among 16 papers submitted to Sage and released as Boris Johnson prepares to unveil a ""road map"" for how to ""unlock the various parts of the UK economy"".One, called Easing Restrictions on Activity and Social Distancing, says: ""If strict restrictions are retained for months and then abruptly eased and people are told it is safe to resume social contact, they will expect this to mean that the risk of infection has ceased or significantly reduced. ""If there is then an increase in infection rates that necessitates a reintroduction of restrictions, this is likely to be seen as a serious failure of policy and trust in public health advice will be lost, leading to lower adherence to advice to restrict or to resume activity. We would advocate trialling easing restrictions very gradually.""To maintain public trust and support, it will be important to have acceptable and equitable criteria for selecting which activities can be resumed. For example, it may be difficult to justify easing restrictions solely for economic activities without any easing of restrictions for low-risk activities with significant social and psychological benefit.""The paper says a traffic light system might be used to provide advice about the relative risks of different behaviours and activities and suggests using methods previously employed in public health campaigns to motivate changes in lifestyle such as a healthy diet. ""Methods that have been used successfully for helping people understand how to implement other behaviour changes (such as healthy eating) include providing a 'traffic light' list of examples of high (avoid), medium (do rarely and carefully) and low (do freely) risk activities and 'modelling' stories describing how other people like themselves in similar situations have overcome barriers to implement guidance successfully,"" it says. The document also suggests that health and safety legislation should be used to address coronavirus infection control risks at work. The two-metre social distancing rule is currently being reviewed by the Government in the hope that relaxing it could allow businesses and schools to reopen.But Sir Patrick told MPs that the infection risk at one metre was as much as 30 times higher than that at two metres, saying: ""The evidence is - as far as you can get very firm evidence on this - that essentially a minute at two metres contact is about the same risk as six seconds at one metre, so that gives you some idea of why the two metres becomes important. ""And the risk at one metre is about 10 to 30 times higher than the risk at two metres, so the distancing is an important part of this.""                     Fears that antibody testing could create a two-tier society                    Rolling out antibody testing to see whether people have had coronavirus            could result in discrimination at work, Government scientists have warned. In a briefing document considered by Sage on April 14, scientists said managers may prioritise those who have tested positive when offering jobs. This could lead to widespread ""gaming"" of the system in which people desperate for work deliberately get infected with Covid-19, they said. Alternatively, a black market for counterfeit positive test results could emerge.Since the early days of the crisis, ministers have touted widespread access to antibody tests as a potentially powerful tool to enable            the easing of restrictions.Assuming that the presence of antibodies indicates at least some immunity from future infection, a positive test result could enable a form of ""immunity passporting"", experts have said.It might also allow parts of the country to leave lockdown earlier than others, a strategy Sir Patrick acknowledged is being examined. Promises of home testing kits were quickly dashed when it emerged the technology was not accurate enough, but there are hopes laboratory-based blood testing systems will be available this month. But the paper, drawn up the day before the Sage meeting, reveals the feared downsides of such tests, saying: ""Some employers may discriminate on the basis of antibody status. This might include not permitting those testing antibody negative to return to work, or only taking on new staff with antibody positive test results.""The Sage committee also examined evidence suggesting that even a test that met Government requirements to be at least 98 per cent accurate could result in a significant number of false positives. Under one scenario, one in four people who test antibody positive may actually not have antibodies, according to a flowchart prepared by the University of Cambridge.The document was released on the day Sir Patrick told the health committee that fewer than one in six people have any sort of antibody protection from Covid-19.He said data from around five weeks ago suggested ""something like a 10 per cent antibody positivity in London"", with three per cent to four per cent antibody positivity in other regions and even less in some areas. On Tuesday, he said he would currently ""not expect to see antibody levels much above mid-teens"" in any region.Sir Patrick said geographical variations could mean certain parts of the country come out of lockdown sooner, adding: ""We know that cities and densely-populated places have a higher prevalence than rural places... and an option that could be considered is to think about whether measures could be done locally versus nationally.""                     The role of face masks                    On Tuesday, Sir Patrick acknowledged acknowledged for the first time that mask-wearing by the general public can have a ""marginal positive effect"" when social distancing is not possible. After Boris Johnson last week said he believed            the use of masks or face coverings would give people ""confidence"" to go back to work, Sir Patrick said there could be times where their use is ""beneficial"". Currently, British advice is in line with that of the World Health Organisation and does not recommend masks for the general public, with officials including Sir Patrick previously describing the evidence for public use as ""weak"". But it is likely that this advice will change as Britain moves out of full lockdown. Asked about the use of face coverings, Sir Patrick said that while it was not ""straightforward"", there was evidence that they have a marginal impact in reducing ""the spread of infection from one person to another"".""Masks may have a marginal positive effect in those situations, or face coverings of some sort,"" he said. ""Where masks have a role is where distancing may not be possible. So there may be some cases where that is not possible, situations where there is undue crowding when wearing masks may be beneficial to stop the spread.""                      Fears the situation in China had spiralled out of control                    By early February, Government scientists believed the outbreak of coronavirus in China was 10 times higher than the regime acknowledged.A document drawn up by one of Sage's sub-groups on Feb 3 concluded that the number of symptomatic cases was being drastically under-reported. The document reveals that, as UK modellers frantically tried to draw up plans for a British response to the pandemic, they were hampered by a lack of data from Beijing.Also among the newly published papers are the results of genomic analysis of new UK cases up to March 20 which found that the majority originated Europe.Sir Patrick said scientists have now been able to ""sequence thousands and thousands of viral genomes"" when looking at Covid-19, and found cases came from Europe.""One of the things that it looks like, very clearly, is that early in March the UK got many, many different imports of virus from many different places,"" he said. ""And those were particularly from European countries with outbreaks.""                     The days before lockdown approached                   On March 2, scientists from Sage subcommittee SPI-M-O, the Scientific Pandemic Influenza Group on Modelling, said: ""It is highly likely that there is a sustained transmission of Covid-19 in the UK at present."" But lockdown did not start until March 23. On the day of the national lockdown, Sage discussed modelling evidence which said ""it is very likely that we will see ICU capacity in London breached by the end of the month, even if additional measures are put in place today"".The same document, written on the previous Friday by SPI-M-O, warned that the rest of the country was one to two weeks behind London, with intensive care capacity also likely to be breached elsewhere without action being taken. Mass school closures would ""increase the likelihood"" of avoiding ICU capacity being breached across the country, it said, with the decision to close schools taken on the same day the paper was drawn up.                     The mistakes made                    ""I'd be amazed if, when we look back, we don't think: 'Yep we could have done something differently,'"" Sir Patrick told MPs.Asked what he would have changed, he singled out testing, suggesting that the speed with which Britain rolled out tests had worsened the crisis. ""I think if we'd managed to ramp up testing capacity quicker, it would have been beneficial"" he said. ""And, you know, for all sorts of reasons that didn't happen.""But he insisted: ""It's completely wrong to think of testing as the answer - it's just part of the system that you need to get right.""England's deputy chief medical officer, Dr Jenny Harries, said lack of capacity explained the decision to abandon routine contact tracing as the UK entered the delay phase of efforts to battle the pandemic. ""If we had unlimited capacity, and the ongoing support beyond that, then we perhaps would choose a slightly different approach,"" she said. Sir Patrick also suggested that allowing the Cheltenham Festival to go ahead may have been a an error, saying he had ""no doubts"" there would have been occasions where things ""could have been done differently"". Asked whether Cheltenham and a Liverpool FC Champions League match should have been allowed to take place in the days before the lockdown was imposed, Sir Patrick said: ""I think that is something in the future for us to look at, and certainly there will be times where evidence didn't allow you to make decisions you can make now.

541,"UK coronavirus lockdown may be eased using 'traffic light' system, say Government scientists;Group which focuses on public behaviour concerned that the abrupt lifting of movement restrictions would undermine trust in health policy","May 5, 2020 Tuesday",International,telegraph.co.uk,569,569,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,"By Laura Donnelly, Health Editor","UK coronavirus lockdown may be eased using 'traffic light' system, say Government scientistsGroup which focuses on public behaviour concerned that the abrupt lifting of movement restrictions would undermine trust in health policy","A ""traffic light"" system advising the public about the risks of different activities could be used to ease lockdown, the Government's scientific advisors have said. The proposals, drawn up last month, suggest lockdown restrictions should be eased ""very gradually"" and warn against relaxing the rules for workers without allowing social activities to resume. The paper was drawn up by the scientific pandemic influenza group on behaviour (SPI-B), and considered by the scientific advisory group for emergencies (Sage) at its April 2 meeting.It warns that the abrupt lifting of restrictions and any subsequent increase in infections could undermine public trust in health policy, and mean people are less likely to comply with future demands. The documents are among 17 papers submitted to Sage in recent weeks, for consideration by the scientists who advise Government. On Sunday, Boris Johnson is expected to deliver an address to the nation unveil a ""roadmap"" setting out how he intends to ""unlock the various parts of the UK economy"".The latest batch of papers, released today, reveal fears among scientists about the impact of any wholesale relaxation of lockdown. The paper, called Easing Restrictions on Activity and Social Distancing, states: ""If strict restrictions are retained for months and then abruptly eased and people are told it is safe to resume social contact they will expect this to mean that the risk of infection has ceased or significantly reduced. ""If there is then an increase in infection rates that necessitates a reintroduction of restrictions this is likely to be seen as a serious failure of policy and trust in public health advice will be lost, leading to lower adherence to advice to restrict or to resume activity.""Warning that stopping and starting activities may not be practical, it says: ""We would advocate trialling easing restrictions very gradually.""""To maintain public trust and support it will be important to have acceptable and equitable criteria for selecting which activities can be resumed. For example, it may be difficult to justify easing restrictions solely for economic activities without any easing of restrictions for low risk activities with significant social and psychological benefit. ""And it says a traffic light system might be used to provide advice about the relative risks of different behaviours and activities.                      How a traffic light system might work                   ""Guidance must explain exactly which activities can be resumed by whom, why, when, and in what way in order to support appropriate adherence,"" the papers say. And it suggests using methods previously used in public health campaigns to motivate other changes in lifestyle-such as a healthy diet. ""For example, methods that have been used successfully for helping people understand how to implement other behaviour changes (such as healthy eating) include providing a 'traffic light' list of examples of high (avoid), medium (do rarely and carefully) and low (do freely) risk activities and 'modelling' stories describing how other people like themselves in similar situations have overcome barriers to implement guidance successfully,"" it says. The document also suggests that health and safety legislation should be used to address coronavirus infection control risks at work. Some of the most vulnerable groups should not be allowed to return to work it suggests.",Newspaper; Web Publication
542,Different rules could undermine solidarity,"May 5, 2020",International,i - Independent Print Ltd,626,626,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,Paul Gallagher HEALTH CORRESPONDENT,Different rules could undermine solidarity,"Selectively lifting lockdown measures could lead to resentment and anger among the population which has otherwise shown solidarity, an expert on the group set up to rival the Government's scientific advisory board said yesterday.Susan Michie, professor of health psychology and director of the Centre for Behaviour Change at University College London, said there was a risk of the measures causing division if, as expected, different sections of the population need to adhere to different measures.She made her comments as part of a 12-strong ""independent"" panel of experts who met for the first time yesterday in a challenge to the official scientific advice group.The Government is being guided by the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) but it has been accused of lacking transparency.Among the accusations are that Sage is open to political influence and that its scientific advisers cannot be truly independent because they are part of a governmentsponsored group. Nor has it published minutes of its meetings and, controversially, political advisers such as Dominic Cummings are known to be able to attend.Sir David King (inset), chief scientific adviser between 2000 and 2007, has formed the new 12-strong group.""We don't know what advice is coming from the scientists on Sage,"" Sir David said. ""There is no transparency.When ministers say that they are simply following the science advice, we the public don't have any check on that.""It will focus on seven key points, including how testing and tracing can work, and the future of social distancing.Their findings will be shared with the public by streaming meetings on YouTube.Sage finally published a list of 50 advisers on the group, led by the chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance and the chief medical officer, Professor Chris Whitty. Two members did not give permission for their names to be made public.Officials are considering how coronavirus restrictions could be lifted, and later this week Boris Johnson is expected to set out a road map out of the lockdown. One policy being considered is that specific groups, such as the over-70s, will be asked to stay in lockdown while others are not.Professor Michie said the public's adherence to restrictions had been surprising, but largely down to a solidarity. ""In terms of lifting the lockdown it's going to be a very different situation. What we're going to be seeing is different measures for different sections of the population and so this has the potential for undermining the collective solidarity that has been so important for trust, for adherence, for helping each other, and if it's not handled well, risks potential division between groups.""Hot topics Subjects occupying the scientists The Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) does not publish minutes of its meetings, but it is highly likely to be covering the same topics as Sir David King's ""independent""group, which will include: Testing and tracing The test, trace, isolate policy for tackling Covid-19 worked successfully in countries such as South Korea, enabling that country to keep the death toll so far down to 252. The UK Government abandoned its contact tracing policy in March but will now be returning to it in a bid to stay ahead of the virus.Social Distancing Ministers are reported to be considering relaxing the two-metre rule for social distancing in workplaces.Seniors Alleged plans to stop people over 70 leaving their homes while restrictions on others are eased have been met with fury. One idea from ministers was to have a list of family and friends who could visit each other, including the elderly.Vaccines Matt Hancock last night played down suggestions that vaccination would be compulsory should it become available.",Newspaper

544,"How long will the UK coronavirus lockdown last?;Dominic Raab has extended UK lockdown for a further three weeks and said restrictions will not be lifted until changes can be ""safely"" made","May 5, 2020 Tuesday",International,telegraph.co.uk,1101,1101,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,"By Sarah Knapton, Science Editor","How long will the UK coronavirus lockdown last?Dominic Raab has extended UK lockdown for a further three weeks and said restrictions will not be lifted until changes can be ""safely"" made","The Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab has extended UK lockdown measures for a further three weeks to prevent the spread of            Covid-19. The announcement on Thursday 16 April came hours after Mr Raab chaired a Cobra meeting to discuss the current social restrictions in place.The extension has been put in place for ""at least"" three weeks which will take the UK to May 7, when we can expect a second review.Mr Raab, who deputised for Boris Johnson, said the Government was being ""as open as we responsibly can at this stage"". ""It would not be responsible to prejudge the evidence that Sage will have and review in just a few weeks' time.""The Foreign Secretary said the Government carefully followed what is happening in other countries but ""we've got to do what is right for the British people based on the advice of our experts, grounded in the conditions prevailing here in the UK"".He said that measures put in place had been successful but that SAGE said that some settings were still seeing infections spreading.He warned that relaxing social restrictions now would damage economy in the longterm.•: How other countries are ending lockdown                     Is lockdown working?                     Less than 12 hours after the Prime Minister's historic address to the nation on March 23, the London Underground was jammed with commuters (see video below), while builders were seen eating together in communal canteens, making a mockery of the Government's rule that no more than two people can gather together in public.Professor Susan Michie, Director of the University College London's Centre for Behaviour Change, warned that some people would simply not be able to carry out the measures, even if they wanted to.""Five million self-employed people are being left potentially destitute by the Government failing to offer financial supportas they have done for directly employed workers,"" she said. ""Since [statutory sick pay of] £94 is not enough to pay rent, bills, food for a family etc, they will be forced to carry on as usual.""The British Transport Police is now on hand to make sure only            critical workers are using the London Underground. But such an inauspicious start to the lockdown suggests the virus will spread further than it would have, had stricter measures been implemented earlier,            as they have in other countries. And it means that the measures we do have are likely to be in place for longer to ""flatten the curve"" in a way that would prevent a second dangerous peak.In addition, on April 1 the Government revealed figures that suggested the lockdown was starting to fray as data showed an ""uptick""            in the number of people using transport.The number of those using their cars and public transport, which had been consistently dropping since strict social distancing measures were introduced, rose for the first time.It is feared that sunny weather will prompt more people to break the rules and go outside to socialise as boredom kicks in.•: Can I go for a drive during lockdown?How long will lockdown last?Mr Raab said the Government needed to be satisfied of five things before it would consider it safe to adjust any of the current measures:•Protect the NHS's ability to cope and be confident that the NHS is able to provide sufficient critical care across the UK.•See a sustained and consistent fall in daily death rates to be confident the UK is beyond the peak.•Reliable data from Sage showing rate of infection is decreasing to manageable levels across the board.•Confident that testing capacity and PPE are in hand with supply able to meet future demand.•Confident that any adjustments to the current measures would not risk a second peak in infections which would overwhelm the NHS.When the lockdown was first announced, Professor Mark Woolhouse, Professor of Infectious Disease Epidemiology, University of Edinburgh, said: ""We now enter a phase of careful monitoring. We are looking for indicators first that the epidemic is slowing down and then for numbers of new cases to start to fall. ""After three weeks we will have to decide whether the restrictions need to be continued, can be relaxed, or can be relaxed temporarily with the expectation of imposing them again later. ""We must also monitor the damage that the lockdown is doing; damage to the economy, to education, to psychological well-being and to health and social care provision in the community. The impacts of this epidemic are too far reaching for policy decisions to be driven by epidemiology alone.""Professor Sheila Bird said that more cases in coming weeks would make it easier for the Government to predict how the epidemic is responding to lockdown measures, which will inform how long they remain in place. ""Once an epidemic takes hold, as now in UK, the country's own data - properly reported and interpreted - take precedence over modelling as the data tell us the actual toll which the epidemic is exacting,"" she said.""A huge amount can be inferred about the immediately forthcoming weeks from these data directly, including whether further policy changes are needed to reinforce social-distancing; for example in particular age groups.""Some experts are still concerned that the current restrictions do not go far enough while others say the government has been hit by an ""epidemic of action"", and is now bringing in measures that have little rationale. Professor Robert Dingwall, Professor of Sociology, at Nottingham Trent University, wrote in The Telegraph: ""It is another triumph of populism over science, of a capitulation to the demand to 'do something'. ""We are still seeing some notion that 'the people' are selfish and must be bullied and disciplined. ""The people are not selfish; they have behaved in ways that are individually rational but have collectively irrational results.""However Dr Andrea Collins, Senior Clinical Lecturer in Respiratory Medicine at the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine (LSTM), said: ""I believe that they have not quite gone far enough. The 'absolutely' necessary to go to work is still being used by some when it is not required-I think we need permits across controlled areas to go to a workplace.""Recent modelling from the universities of Exeter, Bristol and Warwick suggested that without any measures at all, the epidemic would have peaked around 133 days after first person-to-person transmission in Britain, which happened around February 28. So the lockdown has the potential of curtailing the spread by around seven weeks. A welcome relief for people who could have been facing lockdown for most of the summer.",Newspaper; Web Publication

Google confirmed one of its executives, Demis Hassabis, attended ""in a personal capacity as a data scientist"".But minutes of the group's meetings, and its most recent advice, have not been released.Here is how the Independent SAGE group's approach differs from the Government's.oliver.milne@mirror.co.uk @OliverMilne CONTROL OUR BORDERS The group believes there needs to be a port control policy to stop imported cases of infection.Gabriel Scally, visiting professor of public health at the University of Bristol, said Britain should ""take advantage of its island status"", like New Zealand and Taiwan have, to prevent infected people coming in from abroad.He said: ""Nine out of ten of the world's population live in countries where there are border controls in place because of the virus, yet Britain maintains its open borders policy, which places us in some jeopardy.""He said anyone arriving via our airports, ports and the Eurotunnel should be quarantined for 14 days. GOVERNMENT'S POSITION: Open border with travellers arriving in the UK without any checks or quarantine.SEND NHS STAFF TO CARE HOMES Dr Allyson Pollock, a consultant in public health medicine, said that we should be concentrating ""above all"" on the 400,000 residents of care homes around the country.""Many of the deaths in nursing homes were preventable, and people dying alone and without relatives is inhumane and barbaric.""The government could have redeployed staff from quiet bits of the NHS,"" she said. GOVERNMENT'S POSITION: Belatedly began supplying care homes with PPE, but support hasn't included deploying NHS staff.look after ethnic minorities Dr Zubaida Haque, deputy director of race equality group the Runnymede Trust, accused the Government of not considering ethnic minority and immigrant groups in Covid-19 planning.She said: ""Minorities are much more likely to be poor and in insecure jobs, and much more likely to live in poor conditions and overcrowded houses.""If those people are at the brink of poverty or have lost jobs, do they have a sufficient safety net? The anecdotal evidence is they haven't. Government hasn't really considered them.""The trust also wants the suspension of the rule barring new immigrants and asylum seekers from getting benefits, particularly as they now cannot leave. GOVERNMENT'S POSITION: Downing Street has ordered a study into why minorities are at greater risk from www.Covid-19.No extra financial help and no waiving of ""no recourse to public funds"" for new arrivals.local control of coronavirus fight Dr Allyson Pollock believes local government should be given back control of the fight against coronavirus.She said: ""Local government needs to be empowered and enhanced so it can take on public health roles, educational roles, the things that have been decimated and destroyed with billions of pounds worth of cuts over the last 10, 20 years. If we're serious about community involvement we need to rebuild that capacity, including the public health capacity for contact tracing.""government's position: Central coordination of efforts to control the virus, with many services such as testing and contact-tracing centres run by private firms.stop waiting for a vaccine Prof Deenan Pillay, professor of Virology at UCL and a former SAGE member, stresses that we need a wider range of long-term strategies to contain the virus.He said: ""It is the mantra that we need to somehow survive until a vaccine becomes available.""Not only is there uncertainty around that, but even when a vaccine becomes available, that vaccine does not infer 100% protection in everyone who is given it.""We have to be thinking about a long-term pandemic - with ups and downs for maybe years to come.""GOVERNMENT POSITION: Chief Medical Officer Chris Whitty has said the pandemic will be over only when we have access to either a ""highly effective"" vaccine or drugs.focus on the antibody tests Karl Friston, computational modeller at University College London, said that finding out how many people are immune to the virus should be ""the prime focus"" of the coronavirus exit strategy.He said that if, as some American studies suggest, 50% of the population have already had the disease, and if another large portion of the population, including children, are resistant to infection, then so-called ""herd immunity"" would already have been reached and a new wave of the virus would be unlikely. But without data there is no way to be sure.GOVERNMENT POSITION: Roche Diagnostics says it's in talks with the NHS and the Government about rolling out 100% accurate antibody tests from mid-May.INCREASE CRITICAL CARE STAFFING Dr Alison Pittard, dean of the Faculty of Intensive Care Medicine, said the only way the NHS has managed to cope with the surge in critical care patients is by staff working overtime, and by bringing in non-critical care workers. Saying critical care is understaffed, she added: ""We already start off in England with a very low number of critical care beds compared with the rest of Europe, so we're not starting from a good point.""GOVERNMENT POSITION: No plans to increase critical care www.capacity.BE OPEN WITH THE PUBLIC We're being guided by the science dominic raab April 7/9/16/29 jonathan van-tam April 10 priti patel April 11 sir patrick vallance April 16 michael gove April 19 boris johnson March 17/18/21/22/25, April 30 jenny harries March 22, April 5 alok sharma April 1 yvonne doyle April 13Many of the deaths in our care homes were preventable DR ALLYSON POLLOCK HEALTH CONSULTANTBillions of pounds worth of cuts over 10, 20 years DR ALLYSON POLLOCK HEALTH CONSULTANTWe are not starting from a good point DR ALISON PITTARD ON CRITICAL CARE STAFFING",Newspaper

Join Britain Connects and have a chat in lockdownOur readers up and down the country are overcoming isolation by connecting with people they wouldn't usually meet for an online chat. Do you want to join them?,"After weeks in lockdown, many of us have never felt so isolated. Yet we have also never been more connected - to our neighbours, our families, and to all those experiencing the coronavirus across the world.The virus has turned our lives upside down. But it has also shown how our country can pull together. Want to help you build on this on this, launching an exciting, new, ground-breaking project, Britain Connects - connecting people across the UK with different views for a virtual chat.Our readers up and down the country are overcoming isolation by connecting with people they wouldn't usually meet for an online chat. Do you want to join them                     What is it                   The aim is to speak to someone you might not usually meet, to find out what they are like and explore what our nation has in common, whatever our political or other differences.We hope that by connecting people as we reach peak isolation during the coronavirus crisis, we can help bring the country together. With your help, this could be a unique moment of connection - and a positive and meaningful way of marking a one-off moment in global history and all of our lives.                     How does it work                                                               To take part, all you need to do is fill in this questionnaire here. We'll do the rest...                                        We will match people across age, across geography, across life experience and across political lines. Whoever we are, we all facing this together.We'll match you with someone who has different views and set up a video meeting on the weekend 22-24 May.What better way to spend the late May bank holiday than by staying in, saving lives, protecting the NHS - and connecting with someone new Just fill out the survey to get started.                     What can I hope to get out of it                   Last year, the Daily Mirror teamed up with political rivals the Daily Express and many of Reach PLC's regional titles to bring you Britain Talks, which asked people to cross the Brexit divide for a cup of tea and a chat.This year, we're teaming up again to ask people with different experiences of life during the coronavirus to meet up using the technologies keeping many of us in touch with our family and friends.We are also partnering with the Behavioural Insights Team, who helped us build Britain Connects and are studying our project for a paper later this year.""The coronavirus crisis has created a shared experience without precedent for all of us,"" they say. ""This unique situation also means that while we adjust to the pandemic there is an opportunity to connect and bring people closer together as never before.""The Behavioural Insights Team is working with Reach on a very special project to explore this opportunity by connecting strangers from across the country with different backgrounds and views for a video conversation. We will draw on evidence from behavioural science to help make that contact as fruitful as possible and in the process learn more about bridging divides between people. BIT will also measure the impact of these virtual meetings to improve our understanding of how to create a more cohesive society.""This is a unique moment for connection in our country's history - join us here.",Newspaper; Web Publication

The leftist leader said:Yes there's machismo but there's also a lot of family fraternity.Concern over domestic abuse has risen globally, with fears victims are being silenced in Italy, calls for help from women increasing in Spain, and systems to prevent child abuse in the United States hampered by the lockdown.Rights groups said López Obrador's comments contradicted the government's own data.

However, with 84% of today's 1,032 new cases and 67% of the national total located in the capital, the health minister Jaime Mañalich has taken to referring ominously to the situation as the ""battle for Santiago"".According to official statistics released by the health ministry, Chile had largely kept its epidemic under control. However, the country now has 23,048 confirmed cases and 281 people have died having tested positive.Chile has maintained the highest level of testing in Latin America with more than 230,000 tests carried out. And the government has suggested an increase in testing could have contributed to the recent uptick in cases.But the pandemic has also pushed out of the wealthier western suburbs of Santiago into more deprived, poorer-equipped areas of the capital. And the government has announced that 12 more districts will go into quarantine from Friday as part of its ""dynamic"" approach to enforcing and lifting lockdowns.Checkpoints will also be set up around the nearby coastal cities of Viña del Mar and Valparaíso - the country's second-largest population centre - where cases are currently far lower than in the capital.Amid the rise in cases, the government has also softened its rhetoric with regard to a passport-style scheme that it had said would certify ""immunity"". A WHO directive has since urged caution regarding such policies.Nonetheless, the government has said the first cards will be issued on Friday, although they will simply confirm that a person has tested positive for the virus, not that they are immune.block-time updated-timeUpdated at 7.49pm BSTblock-time published-time 7.42pm BST Iceland has all but eliminated the virus as 97% of infected patients have recovered and only two new cases have been confirmed in the last week, the country's chief epidemiologist Thorolfur Gudnason has said.We have been pleasantly surprised to see a very fast deceleration of the pandemic in Iceland.

The United States itself has yet to confirm its participation in the 18-19 May talks of the World Health Assembly, which comes after President Donald Trump vowed to slash funding for the UN body. The US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, told reporters: I want to call on all nations, including those in Europe, to support Taiwan's participation as an observer at the World Health Assembly and other relevant United Nations venues. I also call upon WHO Director-General Tedros (Adhanom Ghebreyesus) to invite Taiwan to observe this month's WHA, as he has the power to do, and as his predecessors have done on multiple occasions. China, which wields a veto on the UN Security Council, considers Taiwan a province awaiting reunification and fights to block it from all international institutions. China's defeated nationalists fled to Taiwan in 1949 but the island has evolved into a vibrant, self-ruling democracy. Taiwan has become a model for its swift response to the coronavirus outbreak, with just six deaths despite its close proximity and economic ties with China, and has donated masks and other supplies around the world.The US state department did not reply to questions on whether the United States would take part in the World Health Assembly, which sets global health policy and is generally attended by health ministers or other senior officials.

A Chinese spokesman confirmed Beijing had been involved, but US officials declined comment. WHO director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, has defended the UN agency against fierce criticism by the US president, Donald Trump, but has promised a review of its performance after the pandemic eases, including by its independent oversight body. An initial draft of the EU resolution, to be debated by WHO health ministers meeting virtually on 18-19 May at the World Health Assembly, includes wording on ""commending the WHO leadership"" but calls for ""an evaluation... at the earliest appropriate moment on lessons learnt from the international health response to Covid-19"". The draft, seen by Reuters, says the evaluation should address the long-term consequences on health and ""gaps in pandemic preparedness"" and reminds the 194 WHO member states they must report outbreaks of disease in a ""timely manner"". ""Negotiations have begun. The Americans, Chinese and Europeans are taking part, almost everyone is. It's a very good sign that everyone is engaged,"" a European diplomat said. If confirmed, the US involvement in discussions about the text would signal that Washington is engaging in diplomacy at the WHO, despite suspending its funding for the agency last month, accusing it of being ""China-centric"" and issuing bad advice.

Companies are desperate to cut costs, many employees have discovered they don't have to travel or dress up to do their jobs, everyone can communicate by email, Slack or Zoom. It is surely time to free the workers and shrink the office. Nobody needs expensive city-centre real estate, complete with receptionists and shuttered canteens, if Mabel from accounts can work just as effectively from a laptop on her ironing board.Already businesses like Barclays and UBS are announcing they're likely to cut their floorspace substantially, and the                    Wall Street Journal                    reports that commercial property prices are tumbling. This looks like a one-way bet.Not so fast. A couple of weeks ago I wrote about the joys and compensations of being at home under lockdown. In the long term, though, the rewards of turning up to share common space with a semi-random but familiar collection of sometimes exasperating, competitive, occasionally pompous colleagues in a shared endeavour are unique and irreplaceable.Nicholas Bloom is a Stanford economist and one of the world's leading researchers into home working. He says many employers have traditionally been reluctant to permit much of it, fearing it could be a ""skiver's charter"". Until now only 5 per cent of British workers have been home-based.Skiving, says Bloom, isn't the problem. Home workers tend to be more productive, not less. What can get lost is what companies require to survive; creativity, motivation, loyalty. Churn rates soar when people feel detached. ""It's very easy for remote workers to get depressed and uninspired at home,"" he says.Three years ago he ran an experiment in home working with a thousand employees in a Chinese company. Five hundred volunteered to work at home, most of them parents. Within nine months half had chosen to return even though they had an average commute of 40 minutes each way. They felt lonely and overlooked. Indeed they were less likely to have been promoted even though their productivity was higher, possibly because they were out of sight and out of mind.Millions of employees have now had to invent remote working overnight, but its disadvantages are huge. Without offices, all the informal interactions, networking, brainstorming, team-building and fortuitous conversations can't happen. There's little camaraderie. The jerky, time-lagged formality of a Zoom meeting eliminates at least half the elements that make it worthwhile; nobody can bond by winking, laughing, or muttering a commentary, and humour is hard to pull off unless you're the boss because no one's listening when you interrupt, and by the time you explain what you've said, the impact is excruciatingly dead.Solemnity dominates. Intense concentration is needed to focus on and interpret what's happening on a screen because it's so hard to read people without seeing their movements, or knowing how they acted when they walked in to a room. Is the boss shifting restlessly in her seat because she detests your idea, or has she just sat on her cat's toy? Managers and staff alike report utter exhaustion after a day of remote meetings. One very successful, much-admired executive tells me she's loathing every day; everything that makes her job enjoyable - motivating people, creating teams, gossip - is absent now.The culture of an organisation is in danger of eroding without older members present to model it, advise and consult, whether as salesman, engineer, literary agent or barrister. Communications become imperious and often misunderstood as orders are issued from the centre without the softening effect of body language, intonation and context.Octavius Black, who runs the behavioural science company Mind Gym, says that with everyone under stress many companies' relationships are already fraying silently because distant staff feel more like functionaries and less like people in their organisation's eyes. They need conscious messaging, participation and reassurance if they're not to either burn out or opt out, unnoticed.To a large extent we enjoy the degree of acting required of us in an office, the element of performance in clothes and behaviour, the chance to play the game of being a more composed, professionally stretched version of who we are. It creates variety and the possibility of assuming several different roles in a day - as manager, ally, peer, friend, subordinate or customer guide.

555,Traffic light' ratings urged for activities,"May 6, 2020",International,i - Independent Print Ltd,636,636,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,Hugo Gye and Tom Bawden,Traffic light' ratings urged for activities,"The Government should consider applying a ""traffic light"" rating system to different activities as part of the way to ease its lockdown, scientific advisers have said.Newly released documents from Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) warn that, as the lockdown is gradually lifted, it will be necessary for ministers to avoid confusing or alienating the public. A paper drawn up by the committee's sub-group on behavioural science last month recommended ""providing a 'traffic light' list of examples of high (avoid), medium (do rarely and carefully) and low (do freely) risk activities"".It also suggested that measures aimed at helping businesses get back to work should be accompanied by a relaxation of the rules that ban socialising between households. The advisers said: ""It may be difficult to justify easing restrictions solely for economic activities without any easing of restrictions for low-risk activities with significant social and psychological benefit.""The group warns that a prolonged lockdown will hit people on low incomes particularly hard and could harm social cohesion. The advisers rejected the idea of an ""on-off"" lockdown with social-distancing measures being tightened and relaxed as the rate of coronavirus infection changes, saying that would ""be seen as a serious failure of policy and trust in public health advice will be lost"".The papers also revealed experts' concerns that some people would deliberately catch Covid-19 to obtain an ""immunity passport"" while workers with Covid-19 antibodies could be given riskier frontline roles by unscrupulous employers. One expressed fears that employers might ""actively discriminate"" against workers not shown to have antibodies. ""This might include not permitting those testing antibody negative to return to work or only taking on new staff with antibody positive test results,"" the paper said.Experts feared the tests may not be accurate enough, meaning some people might go back to work thinking they had immunity when they did not. It also warned of the risk of people trying to ""game"" the system by attempting to purchase a fake test result showing they are now immune.The Government promised that Sage will increase the frequency with which it publishes the documents submitted to the group to help it draw up advice for ministers. But it is redacting any sections which relate to policies A No 10 spokesman said: ""We'll publish all of the evidence in the coming weeks and months. Some evidence remains under live consideration for policy decisions being made by Government and as such it wouldn't be appropriate to publish at this time. Releasing policy still under formulation could cause unnecessary confusion to the public.""The documents released yesterday, going back to February, show scientists considered it ""very likely"" that London's intensive-care capacity would be overwhelmed by Covid-19. Genetic experts on Sage found in March that there were 12 different strains of Covid-19 in the UK.Sunak considers cuts to furlough subsidy scheme Plans to cut back the coronavirus furlough scheme to encourage workers to look for new jobs are being examined by the Chancellor.More than 6 million workers have been furloughed at a potential cost to the taxpayer of £8bn. Under the job retention scheme, the Treasury pays 80 per cent of their wages.The Evening Standard reported that Rishi Sunak is now considering plans to taper the payments after the current scheme ends in June.It said one option is to reduce the subsidy to 60 per cent, with further small reductions to follow. That would mean people on the scheme become worse off, encouraging them to find new work. Another option is to allow some furloughed staff to work with a smaller subsidy, helping employers operating with a smaller income after lockdown.Nigel Morris",Newspaper
556,Advice against handshakes on same day as PM's boast,"May 6, 2020 Wednesday",International,The Independent (United Kingdom),456,456,England & Wales,ANDREW WOODCOCK POLITICAL EDITOR,Advice against handshakes on same day as PM's boast,"Government scientists said ministers should discourage the public from shaking hands on the same day that Boris Johnson said he had shaken hands with ""everybody"" on a visit to a hospital with coronavirus patients, newly released documents have revealed.Members of a scientific advisory committee agreed on 3 March that official advice should warn against handshaking for hygiene reasons, and ministers should instead promote an alternative greeting. But later that day, Mr Johnson told a Downing Street press conference that he had not ditched the traditional form of greeting.""I can tell you that I'm shaking hands continuously,"" he said. ""I was at a hospital the other night where I think there were actually a few coronavirus patients and I shook hands with everybody, you'll be pleased to know, and I continue to shake hands"".Two days later the prime minister made a point of shaking hands with Phillip Schofield, even though the presenter kept his hands to his sides when he interviewed him on ITV's This Morning.He was then photographed on 9 March shaking hands with the boxer Anthony Joshua at the Commonwealth Day service at Westminster Abbey.Records released by the Scientific Advisory Group on Emergencies (Sage) have revealed that its Independent Scientific Pandemic Influenza Group on Behaviours (SPI-B) had discussed the issue earlier that day.And it came to a clear conclusion: ""There was agreement that government should advise against greetings such as shaking hands and hugging, given existing evidence about the importance of hand hygiene. Promoting a replacement greeting or encouraging others to politely decline a proffered handshake may have benefit.""Mr Johnson later made clear he had given up handshaking, but he has since been criticised for encouraging public complacency about the need to change behaviour in response to the Covid-19 outbreak.His comments came at a time when the elbow-nudge or ""Wuhan handshake"" - touching shoes - were becoming popular as a means to avoid the skin-to-skin contact which can spread coronavirus.Mr Johnson's official spokesperson yesterday said the PM would not have seen the SPI-B paper by the time he made his comments, which referred to a hospital visit a few days before.""The PM was very clear at the time that he was taking a number of precautionary steps, including frequently washing his hands,"" said the spokesperson. ""Once the social distancing advice was changed, the prime minister's approach changed.""""The Sage papers are papers which have been considered by Sage and inform the advice that Sage has given to ministers, they are not Sage's final advice to ministers. In terms of the prime minister, I wouldn't be able to say if he would ever have seen that document.""",Newspaper

Because women like Rosena Allin-Khan have put up with it all their lives;Women learn from experience that every time they express an opinion, they walk a tightrope. It was no different for the Tooting MP and A&E doctor","May 6, 2020 Wednesday",International,The Independent (United Kingdom),1062,1062,England & Wales,Pragya Agarwal,"Why did Matt Hancock's tone policing backfire? Because women like Rosena Allin-Khan have put up with it all their livesWomen learn from experience that every time they express an opinion, they walk a tightrope. It was no different for the Tooting MP and A&E doctor","When the shadow minister for mental health, Rosena Allin-Khan, asked            Matt Hancock, the health secretary, about the government's failure to test frontline workers for            Covid-19 during Health Questions, the average person would have expected a relatively respectful response. Instead, visibly irritated by Allin-Khan's audacity to do her job as an A&E doctor and an MP in her Tooting constituency, ie, hold the government accountable, Hancock denied her claims that a lack of testing was costing lives and told her to take a leaf out of the shadow secretary of state's book ""in terms of tone"".Thankfully, when Allin-Khan refused to, Twitter erupted with outpourings of support. While Hancock's comment raised concerns about the everyday sexism women face, Allin-Khan's response has resonated in particular with women of colour who have been silenced in similar ways and policed in the public sphere by men for too long. Women of colour are often called ""aggressive"" when they are merely being direct, with longstanding tropes, such as the ""angry black woman"", harming some communities more than others. Think back to depictions of Serena Williams or instances of similar words being levelled at Michelle Obama, the former first lady, wherein Michelle was called an ""angry black woman"" on the campaign trail and was perceived to be emasculating her husband. Every time I express a mildly strong opinion on social media, I have faced backlash, particularly from white men, advising me to ""not be so angry all the time"".Looking at the clip, it's clear there was absolutely nothing wrong with Allin-Khan's tone. Yet Hancock wasted no time insinuating that this woman, with her expert opinion - based on personal experience as a frontline worker - was in some way being aggressive or threatening merely because she expressed herself in a straightforward and authoritative way. It's a prime example of gender policing - the enforcement of normative gender ideals associated with the gender binary onto individuals. In many contexts, gender performances consistent with normative ""masculinity"" or ""femininity"" are encouraged and rewarded, whereas gender transgressive performances (defying gender norms) are discouraged through punishment or, more often, negative reactions. Women are expected to be silent - ""good women do not talk"" - and girls are taught to be nice, selfless, polite, quiet. Women learn from experience that every time they express an opinion, they walk a tightrope. They are either considered too aggressive or ""mouthy"", or they are interrupted and shut down. In her ""Oh Do Shut Up Dear!"" lectures, classicist Mary Beard examines how women's voices have been silenced in public in particular, using examples such as Penelope from Homer's Odyssey being told that ""speech will be the business of men"". Women's capacity to speak has always been perceived as more threatening, and their voices seen as more ""annoying"", especially in the public sphere.Yale psychologist Victoria L Brescoll found that male senators with more power (as measured by tenure and leadership positions) spoke more on the Senate floor than their junior colleagues. Women, on the other hand, become more concerned about backlash as they reach leadership positions, so female leaders are likely to speak less often than men in spaces with equal representation of men and women because they are fearful of being perceived as aggressive. The final part of this study showed that powerful women are in fact correct in assuming that they will incur backlash as a result of talking more than others.Women and men are treated differently in the workplace. Women, in essence, face a double-bind bias. They are either too ""soft"" to be good leaders or, if they demonstrate qualities that are more ""masculine"", they are considered too aggressive and therefore bad leaders. Masculine-feminine stereotypes count not only against women but also against men. They push people into certain boxes and when they demonstrate qualities that are not seen as the norm they are more likely to be bullied. Women are punished (through words and gestures) for talking, while men are rewarded. Women continue to be judged through a different lens than men, the underlying bias being that what women have to say is not as important.Racial microaggressions and ingrained bias also manifest in response to women of colour expressing anger. Women are often interrupted or made to feel embarrassed for speaking up, tactics designed to silence and discredit them. The intersection of race and gender always creates a much more heightened policing environment for women of colour. As Kimberlé Crenshaw has said: ""Race and gender are always interconnected and never exist as separately distinct, disaggregated identities.""Language, and the words we use, are often a result of socialisation. It is an anchor for societal norms and has to be understood in the right context. If it is conveyed through words and actions that women are the inferior sex, then this reflects the wider societal perception and view of women.In challenging such encounters, however, the focus shifts back from the aggressor to the response from the individual under attack. Within a few seconds, any woman who fights back against stereotypes or the policing of her voice is transformed into an aggressive, erratic, oversensitive woman, thereby seen to be confirming more of the same stereotypes that she is standing up against. It is often a hopeless, no-win situation. In this case, Allin-Khan has taken the incident in her stride, ironically repeating iterations of what Hancock said to her. While on one hand this demonstrates the absurdity of the encounter, it also sadly shows that women of colour are so used to being challenged and policed that they almost expect it, and in some ways accept it too. This kind of behaviour might seem inconsequential, but such microaggressions - communicated via verbal or nonverbal messages - are targeted at people based on their membership of a marginalised group, and in this way demean and devalue them, ""othering"" them, highlighting their inferior status and marginalising them even further.

563,Mixed messages': UK government's strategy fuels fears of rule-breaking;Critics of No 10 warn U-turns undermining efforts to keep public safe from coronavirusCoronavirus - latest updatesSee all our coronavirus coverage,"May 7, 2020 Thursday",International,The Guardian (London),1171,1171,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,Rowena Mason and Ian Sample,Mixed messages': UK government's strategy fuels fears of rule-breakingCritics of No 10 warn U-turns undermining efforts to keep public safe from coronavirusCoronavirus - latest updatesSee all our coronavirus coverage,"First people were meant to stay at home to save lives, and then government sources raised the prospect of picnics with pals and sunbathing in the park just before a sunny bank holiday weekend.Boris Johnson told the nation that scientists thought face masks might help stop the spread of the disease, but no change was made to the government advice that they were not needed outside medical and care settings.Meanwhile, other reports suggested schools could be allowed back on 11 May (now impossible), that the furlough scheme could be abruptly wound down ( causing anxiety for millions of workers ) and that over-70s could be asked to stay at home for longer than the rest of society, potentially more than a year (            provoking a backlash ).The catalogue of confusing messaging emanating from Downing Street and its ministers does not stop there - with even some supporters of the government beginning to question whether No 10 is maintaining enough discipline to give the public a clear message on how to stay safe.""I don't know what's going on with the comms team but it's obviously not the slick operation we're told they're supposed to be,"" says a former Tory adviser who has worked for Johnson.No 10 was quick to engage in a ""dampening down"" exercise on Thursday, insisting that lockdown measures would only be eased gradually and claiming that newspapers had ""overegged"" the idea that Sunday's slight relaxing of the rules amounted to jubilant liberation.But the damage had to some extent already been down, with fury among leaders of the devolved administrations about the ""mixed messages"" and warnings from scientists that bungled communications would lead people to gradually break the rules, thinking they no longer needed to abide by physical distancing so strictly.When Johnson unveiled his slogan of ""Stay home, Protect the NHS, Save lives"" on 20 March, the message was meant to be clear. Devised by the campaign-winning brains behind ""Get Brexit Done"" and ""Take Back Control"", it was a signal that the prime minister was serious about a lockdown after weeks of insisting that only handwashing was necessary to combat coronavirus.At first it seemed to be working, emblazoned across three physically distanced podiums every day for Downing Street's press conference. Additional hard-hitting social media adverts stressed that ""people will die"" if the advice was not followed.And the figures showed that people were indeed staying at home for the most part, with traffic and public transport usage down hugely for weeks.However, the purity of the message began to fray as cabinet splits emerged on how to begin to ease the lockdown, and the pace it should be done. While Johnson was recovering from coronavirus in hospital and then at his Chequers country retreat, the first rumblings started to appear in the media from anonymous ministers pressing for schools to be reopened, less than three weeks after the lockdown was first imposed.Rishi Sunak, the chancellor, Michael Gove, the Cabinet Office minister, and Liz Truss, the trade secretary, have emerged as the most hawkish about a swift end to restrictions because of worries about the economy and its wider public health impacts on mental health, domestic violence and deaths from other missed illnesses.This reflects the wider mood of the party, according to one Conservative MP. ""I think it's an incredibly dangerous moment for No 10, because of the risk of getting it wrong. There is some real worry about this in party, about not having a decision and a clear message. We will fight for anything but this is not the way to do it. And there is widespread concern among backbenchers that without an end to the lockdown soon we'll destroy the economy further and not really save any extra lives,"" he says.Tory insiders say the tensions inside the cabinet and wider party have led to a battle over the right strategy, and hence some of the confusion.Alastair Campbell, the former director of communications in Downing Street under Tony Blair, who has been a consistent critic of the government's messaging, said: ""I just think they are completely out of their depth and because most of the press is so slavish it makes them totally complacent.""They just don't think things through. I'm afraid I think it's all of a pattern. The reason all this matters is that at some stage they are going to have to reset their strategy in a pretty big way and how they communicate with the public... they're not going to be able to do that until they admit they have made a lot of mistakes.""He added: ""All they need to do is say these are the facts, these are the problems and this is how we will deal with them. They've turned everything into: 'We're right, everybody's wrong, aren't we doing well?'""Criticism of the government's approach is also coming from members of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), with scientists increasingly frustrated about information being given out piecemeal in political briefings, rather than communicated factually at the right time.""It's really unhelpful to have bits and pieces of information leaked,"" one Sage adviser said. ""They are going to have to undo, now, a lot of damage. The government needs to come out before Sunday. The sooner there is some damage limitation, and that's what we're talking about, the better.""It's incredibly damaging. If people are primed to look at things in a certain way, it will shape how they receive the information. So on Sunday they will be looking for the green lights and they won't notice the red lights. It's a really powerful way of influencing people.""We're looking at a three-day sunny bank holiday weekend, and sections of society may take this as 'we'll do what we want' because it's all changing Sunday anyway. Once the lid is taken off and people break some rules, they will be much more likely to carry on breaking them.""The scientist stressed that there was an urgent need for more focus on social distancing, hand hygiene, the use of tissues, and the nose, mouth and eyes messaging again. ""This is an example of the dangers of trailing, rather than getting the whole message all in one go,"" they added.Speaking in a personal capacity, John Drury, professor of social psychology at the University of Sussex, expressed similar concerns. He is a member of an expert sub-group - the Scientific Pandemic Influenza group on Behaviour ( SPI-B ) - that feeds in to Sage.""The rightwing media's language and premature celebration of the supposed end of lockdown is dangerous and irresponsible framing of what might be about to happen,"" he said, warning that the messaging was at odds with the continued need to maintain the handwashing and physical distancing that will still be needed.""These headlines risk creating a normative climate where people think that we can all go straight back to the old 'normal',"" he said.

564,Women like Allin-Khan have put up with tone-policing Hancocks all their lives,"May 7, 2020 Thursday",International,The Independent (United Kingdom),1048,1048,England & Wales,PRAGYA AGARWAL,Women like Allin-Khan have put up with tone-policing Hancocks all their lives,"When the shadowminister for mental health,Rosena Allin-Khan, askedMatt Hancock, the health secretary, about the government's failure to test frontline workers forCovid-19during Health Questions, the average person would have expected a relatively respectful response.Instead, visibly irritated by Allin-Khan's audacity to do her job as an A&E doctor and an MP in her Tooting constituency, ie, hold the government accountable, Hancock denied her claims that a lack of testing was costing lives and told her to take a leaf out of the shadow secretary of state's book ""in terms of tone"".Thankfully, when Allin-Khan refused to, Twitter erupted with outpourings of support. While Hancock's comment raised concerns about the everyday sexism women face, Allin-Khan's response has resonated in particular with women of colour who have been silenced in similar ways and policed in the public sphere by men for too long. Women of colour are often called ""aggressive"" when they are merely being direct, with longstanding tropes, such as the ""angry black woman"", harming some communities more than others. Think back to depictions of Serena Williams or instances of similar words being levelled atMichelle Obama, the former first lady, wherein Michelle was called an ""angry black woman"" on the campaign trail and was perceived to be emasculating her husband. Every time I express a mildly strong opinion on social media, I have faced backlash, particularly from white men, advising me to ""not be so angry all the time"".Looking at the clip, it's clear there was absolutely nothing wrong with Allin-Khan's tone. Yet Hancock wasted no time insinuating that this woman, with her expert opinion - based on personal experience as a frontline worker - was in some way being aggressive or threatening merely because she expressed herself in a straightforward and authoritative way.It's a prime example of gender policing - the enforcement of normative gender ideals associated with the gender binary onto individuals. In many contexts, gender performances consistent with normative ""masculinity"" or ""femininity"" are encouraged and rewarded, whereas gender transgressive performances (defying gender norms) are discouraged through punishment or, more often, negative reactions.Women are expected to be silent - ""good women do not talk"" - and girls are taught to be nice, selfless, polite, quiet. Women learn from experience that every time they express an opinion, they walk a tightrope. They are either considered too aggressive or ""mouthy"", or they are interrupted and shut down.In her""Oh Do Shut Up Dear!""lectures, classicist Mary Beard examines how women's voices have been silenced in public in particular, using examples such as Penelope from Homer's Odysseybeing told that ""speech will be the business of men"".Women's capacity to speak has always been perceived as more threatening, and their voices seen as more ""annoying"", especially in the public sphere.Yale psychologist Victoria LBrescoll found that male senators with more power (as measured by tenure and leadership positions)spoke more on the Senate floorthan their junior colleagues. Women, on the other hand, become more concerned about backlash as they reach leadership positions, so female leaders are likely to speak less often than men in spaces with equal representation of men and women because they are fearful of being perceived as aggressive. The final part of this study showed that powerful women are in fact correct in assuming that they will incur backlash as a result of talking more than others.Women and men are treated differently in the workplace. Women, in essence, face a double-bind bias. They are either too ""soft"" to be good leadersor, if they demonstrate qualities that are more ""masculine"", they are considered too aggressive and therefore bad leaders.Masculine-feminine stereotypes count not only against women but also against men. They push people into certain boxes and when they demonstrate qualities that are not seen as the norm they are more likely to be bullied. Women are punished (through words and gestures) for talking, while men are rewarded. Women continue to be judged through a different lens than men, the underlying bias being that what women have to say is not as important.Racial microaggressions and ingrained bias also manifest in response to women of colour expressing anger. Women are often interrupted or made to feel embarrassed for speaking up, tactics designed to silence and discredit them. The intersection of race and gender always creates a much more heightened policing environment for women of colour. As Kimberlé Crenshaw has said: ""Race and gender are always interconnected and never exist as separately distinct, disaggregated identities.""Language, and the words we use, are often a result of socialisation. It is an anchor for societal norms and has to be understood in the right context. If it is conveyed through words and actions that women are the inferior sex, then this reflects the wider societal perception and view of women. In challenging such encounters, however, the focus shifts back from the aggressor to the response from the individual under attack. Within a few seconds, any woman who fights back against stereotypes or the policing of her voice is transformed into an aggressive, erratic, oversensitive woman, thereby seen to be confirming more of the same stereotypes that she is standing up against. It is often a hopeless, no-win situation.In this case, Allin-Khan has taken the incident in her stride, ironically repeating iterations of what Hancock said to her. While on one handthis demonstrates the absurdity of the encounter, it also sadly shows that women of colour are so used to being challenged and policed that they almost expect it, and in some ways accept it too. This kind of behaviour might seem inconsequential, but such microaggressions - communicated via verbal or nonverbal messages - are targeted at people based on their membership of a marginalised group, and in this way demean and devalue them, ""othering"" them, highlighting their inferior status and marginalising them even further.Dr Pragya Agarwal is a behavioural scientist, activist and writer.

Health and social care workers must be adequately protected. Though the right would like to see Mr Johnson offer a timeline for key measures, this should be resisted.

NHS England figures show 12 deaths so far for hospital patients aged 0 to 19 who had tested positive. Some nine, including the baby, had a pre-existing health condition, while three did not. The total death toll in the UK, among patients who have tested positive for Covid-19 now stands at 31,241 - 1,072 more than Italy's total of 30,201.  Government misses 100,000 testing target for sixth day For the sixth day in a row the government missed its target of testing 100,000 people for coronavirus. Despite a rise of more than 10,000 on the previous day, the level reach was 97,029. Defending the figure, the environment secretary, George Eustice said: ""The important thing is to have those ambitious targets you're working to, to just continually build the capacity."" He claimed the prime minister's new target of 200,000 tests per day by the end of the May, was for capacity rather than tests carried out. He said: ""The prime minister's announced in the last week that we're going to ramp that up further to 200,000 tests capacity per day.""  Plea to open fast food outlets but 'no dramatic change in lockdown' Eustice has urged more takeaway food outlets to reopen. He said: ""We never mandated that they should close."" He also said: ""McDonalds drive through was made for social distancing."" But he confirmed there would be no ""dramatic overnight change"" in the lockdown rules on Sunday.  UK scientists' fury over attempt to censor Covid-19 advice Government scientific advisers are furious at what they see as an attempt to censor their advice on government proposals during the Covid-19 lockdown by heavily redacting an official report before it was released to the public, the Guardian can reveal. The report was one of a series of documents published by Sage this week to mollify growing criticism about the lack of transparency over the advice given to ministers responding to the coronavirus. However large blocks of text in the report, produced by SPI-B, the Sage subcommittee providing advice from behavioural scientists on how the public might respond to lockdown measures, were entirely blanked out. Wales unveils modest easing of the lockdown The first minister, Mark Drakeford, says it is too soon to ease the lockdown in Wales but announced three modest adjustments.•Local exercise will be allowed more than once a day.•Garden centres will be opened with physical distancing measures.•Local authorities will open libraries and recycling centres.Schools will not be opened at the start of June, Drakeford confirmed. He also revealed the R number in Wales is estimated to be 0.8 and if it stays at that level 800 people will die in Wales by August. If it increases to 1.1 an estimated 7,200 will die in Wales. Sturgeon warns against easing the lockdown Scotland's first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, said she was only considering relaxing the restrictions on exercising, saying the R number in Scotland was too close to 1 to contemplate any other easing measures. She also announced a further 49 deaths in Scotland taking its death toll to 1,811. She said: ""By easing restrictions prematurely we would risk undoing all the progress that we've made, we would risk allowing the virus to spread out of control and that would cost lives."" Rail services set to increase Plans to ramp up rail services have been brought forward by a week and will start from next Monday, a union is claiming. Services were expected to be increased gradually from 18 May as part of an easing of the economic lockdown. The Rail, Maritime and Transport union said it had discovered that the plans had been brought forward to start on Monday 11 May. Calls to ease lockdown for angling, shooting and bowls Anglers, game shooting enthusiasts and bowls clubs are increasing the pressure for the lockdown to be eased for their sports, arguing that they can resume them while remaining physically distanced. Lobbyists for fishing and game shooting claim that continuing strict lockdown restrictions for their pursuits could cost the UK economy millions of pounds and lead to thousands of job losses.

You will get some days of surplus tests where people haven't come forward to take them in some areas, and you will have other areas where you don't have quite enough capacity for that local demand.The important thing is to have those ambitious targets you're working to, to just continually build the capacity. But you will of course get daily fluctuations in availability in any given local area.""And, asked about the government's new target to conduct 200,000 tests by the end of the month, Eustice insisted it would not distract from delivering the current testing capacity. ""I think it is important and helpful to have targets you're moving towards,"" he said.That's why we had that ambitious target to get to 100,000 and again to get to 200,000 by the end of this month. I don't really understand at all why that would distract from those that are delivering the current test capacity and they can continue to do so, the planning for an expansion is done by an entirely different set of people.As we start to roll out things such as our track and trace approach, testing will become quite an important feature of that.""block-time updated-timeUpdated at 5.56pm BSTblock-time published-time 5.39pm BST The government has been challenged on revelations that almost 80% of respirators in the national pandemic stockpile were out of date when the coronavirus hit the UK.

The environment secretary, George Eustice, said: During this difficult time, our frontline food charities are doing brilliant work amid a significant increase in demand - working in refuges, drop-in services, homeless centres and other places.It is absolutely vital they have the resources they need and this funding will help the most vulnerable in our society get the food they need at this enormously challenging time.""The funding is part of the £750m pot announced by the chancellor for charities across the UK during the coronavirus outbreak. It comes after charities reported unprecedented levels of demand for assistance, while facing a drop-off in donations. Lindsay Boswell, chief executive of FareShare, said: We welcome this support from Defra to obtain vital food supplies, on top of the generosity already shown by the UK food industry. This will enable us to continue to supply much-needed food and drink to the many thousands of frontline charities and community groups across England that are doing the humbling work of getting meals to very vulnerable people during this crisis.""The programme will provide millions of meals over the next three months delivered via charities, including FareShare, the largest not-for-profit organisation that redistributes food in England and nationwide.

However, Earlam told PA:The evidence suggests that keeping the body fit and healthy could be one of the best things to do to prevent Covid-19, but I think gyms and leisure centres are quite far down on the pecking order of opening things up again, which seems pretty counter-intuitive.I believe leisure centres and gyms could be safely reopened quite easily, not everything would be the same at the start, there would have to be screens on reception desks, floor markings ensuring members stay two metres away and every piece of equipment would be cleaned after every use, with hand towels readily available. The numbers of people entering could also be limited, with ill people advised to stay at home.""Claiming his company's gyms were ""incredibly clean"" and insisting staff would be given PPE, he said his facilities would be ready to open in the coming weeks. He added: We'd also be in the position to reopen outdoor swimming pools - all the advice suggests chlorine kills Covid stone dead.

The youngest victim with no known underlying health issues was Ismail Mohamed Abdulwahab, who died in March aged just 13.After his case emerged, one expert called for research into deaths which have occurred outside of patient groups believed to be at higher risk.Dr Nathalie MacDermott, an academic clinical lecturer at King's College London, said at the time: It is essential that we undertake research to determine why a proportion of deaths occur outside of the groups expected to succumb to infection as it may indicate an underlying genetic susceptibility.Determining if this is the case could help us to learn more about the interaction of the virus with the immune system and subsequently what further treatments may be suitable in patients with severe infection.""People of all ages with underlying health problems are believed to be at higher risk from the effects of the virus. But a major British study of almost 17,000 patients with severe Covid-19 found that only a very small number of children fall seriously ill.The study, which examined data from 16,749 Covid-19 patients in 166 hospitals between 6 February and 18 April, found that under-18s accounted for less than 2% of the study sample and under-fives accounted for 0.8%.block-time updated-timeUpdated at 4.18pm BSTblock-time published-time 3.41pm BST  Coronavirus deaths in Wales increase by 28 to 1,090  Public Health Wales has announced another 28 coronavirus deaths taking the death toll to 1,090 in Wales.

We are clearly past the peak of this first wave, but a more major easing of the social distancing rules now would risk a large second wave a few weeks down the line, with increasing hospital admissions and deaths.It seems unlikely that these minor measures announced today by the First Minister for Wales will have any significant detrimental effect on the rate of new infections. We know that the risk of the infection being transmitted is much lower outdoors so exercising more than once a day should not pose a risk.I would expect similar measures to be announced by the other UK nations.block-time published-time 3.29pm BST Research by Citizens Advice suggests many vulnerable workers are having their health put at risk by their employer not furloughing them on the government's scheme.A press release on the study said: The charity's frontline advisers are helping workers in the shielded group, such as those undergoing chemotherapy, who have been denied furlough despite instructions to stay at home and avoid face-to-face contact. Many have been left relying on £95.85 per week from statutory sick pay and any additional benefits they might be entitled to. In the week after applications for the Job Retention Scheme launched on 20 April, Citizens Advice gave one-to-one employment advice to almost 4,200 workers. An analysis of a randomised sample of a tenth of these cases showed that over 70% of those who are shielding or are potentially at higher risk from coronavirus had not been furloughed. Those at higher risk include people who are pregnant or have conditions such as diabetes.Employers are currently allowed to furlough people for any reason arising from the coronavirus pandemic, including to protect employees' health. Citizens Advice is calling for the most vulnerable workers to have a right to be furloughed if their work would require them to breach public health advice. This should include people in the shielded group or who share a household with someone in the shielded group. These workers should also be able to retain access to the Job Retention Scheme for as long as public health advice requires them not to work.Food shop key worker Colleen, 55, is in the shielded group as she has Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease. She has been denied furlough and instead put on Statutory Sick Pay. Her husband works as a carer and so can't return home.She said: ""I really wish I never gave my work the [shielding] letter because at least I wouldn't be struggling to get by. But my husband rightly said working would put me at risk. It's just a catch-22. I'm damned if I work and I'm damned if I don't go to work.""Being on SSP means I take home over £200 a month less than if I was working.

A second committee member said: ""The impression I'm getting is this government doesn't want any criticism.""On Friday afternoon, after the Guardian revealed frustrations over the redacted report, another member of the government's advisory committee took to Twitter to complain of what he said was ""Stalinist"" censorship.""Personally, I am more bemused than furious,"" said Stephen Reicher, a professor of social psychology at the University of St Andrews. ""The greatest asset we have in this crisis is the trust and adherence of the public. You want trust? You need to be open with people. This isn't open. It is reminiscent of Stalinist Russia. Not a good look.""Members of the committee have been discussing among themselves how best to respond to the redaction, which they believe was a heavy-handed move that jeopardises their independence.At least one scientific adviser is understood to be considering resigning over the government's secretive approach to science around the Covid-19 outbreak, which they believe is undermining public trust.The report, from 1 April, summarised SPI-B's discussions about how to handle possible changes to the social distancing measures that had just been introduced to slow the spread of Covid-19.In the version published on Sage's government website, almost a page and a half of text was heavily redacted. The Guardian understands the blocked text related to SPI-B's criticism about possible government proposals around that time.These included the idea of reducing the amount of time Britons could spend exercising or shopping, and stricter financial penalties for those found to be breaking the lockdown. A third proposal involved requiring people to self-validate their movements, as was occurring in France, where citizens were required to complete permits before leaving home.Experts on SPI-B, which includes professors in psychology, epidemiology and anthropology, said they felt the proposals were too punitive and more likely to result in unfair treatment among people in deprived economic circumstances.A spokesperson for the Government Office for Science said the redactions took place because the policies discussed in the document were still under consideration.""The only redactions relate to comments made by a Sage subgroup where specific reference is made to policy still under consideration or to remove contact,"" the spokesperson said.""Redactions were carried out by officials working for the Sage secretariat in consultation with the department developing the policy. All the subgroups were notified and given the opportunity to comment in advance of publication on the redactions being made to specific elements of any papers.""However, SPI-B advisers who spoke to the Guardian disputed that they had been consulted.  ""We weren't given advance notice and we still haven't been given a satisfactory explanation,"" the second SPI-B member said, adding they felt the redaction had been intended to stifle criticism.""This government has failed to show any self-criticism whatsoever, when it is glaringly obvious to everybody that big mistakes have been made. If you want the trust of the population you hold up your hand and you say 'we've made these mistakes, this is why they happened, we regret it, we're learning from it'. Rather than just keep saying 'we've done the most fantastic job' and not being open to criticism in any way.""A third member of SPI-B said they felt the redactions undermined the expert group's independence from politicians. ""What is recorded in the redacted document is us criticising those proposals. They were just not particularly well thought out. Here we were being independent, and you can't see it [because of the redactions].""A fourth member of SPI-B questions whether the heavy redaction might even have been a mistake, as the documents were summaries of the committee's discussions produced by civil servants.""Whether it was a mistake or deliberate doesn't matter; it should not have happened, it's deeply problematic,"" the adviser said. ""The public needs to have trust and confidence in the scientific advice, which the government claims it is relying on, and to see sections redacted in published documents diminishes trust and confidence.""The committee's consideration of the government proposals is understood to have occurred during the first week of the lockdown, which began on 23 March.The behavioural scientists said in their four-page report that there was a consensus that the high-levels of adherence to government guidelines ""are likely to be maintained in the short-to-medium term, for as long as it is evident that Covid-19 poses a serious risk that cannot be managed in any other way"".However they were concerned that introducing more coercive measures, such as more draconian restrictions on movements, risked undermining the high levels of adherence, which they said was ""likely based on a sense of community cooperation"".",Newspaper

""That tone demonises fans who have been very mature during this crisis, complying with the lockdown and also contributing admirably, to food banks and community aid.""Enable - whose leadership includes Clifford Stott, a professor of social psychology who sits on the SPI-B sub-committee of the government's scientific advisory group on emergencies (Sage) - has been funded by the EFL for two years to research collaborative policing.""I do not see the rationale for regional hubs,"" West said. ""I believe football clubs, in their localities, can play a leadership role in the crisis, hosting matches when they are allowed and giving guidance to their supporters about the social distancing and other measures required to keep safe.""The Premier League's Project Restart plan proposes playing the remaining matches at eight to 10 neutral grounds. That is understood to result partly from police advice to the government that supporters would gather in large numbers outside home grounds and breach physical distancing requirements.DCC Mark Roberts, head of the UK Football Policing Unit, had said the Premier League and EFL would be putting an impracticable strain on police and other emergency services if they played matches at home.The language is of stark warnings being given about fans gathering, which is really disappointing  Owen West   ""Football must appreciate that as the country begins what will inevitably be a long route to normality there will be a significant and unpredictable demand on the police, ambulance and local authorities, all of which are currently stretched, in part through the abstraction of our staff,"" Roberts said. ""In my own force, our planning team, including football officers, have been redeployed into a logistical team managing elements of our Covid-19 response""The requirement of football is that it should look at flexible options that minimise its call on public services and not add to them through unrealistic demands.""Playing out 450-plus games at 92 stadiums is an impracticable burden to put on the police, ambulance and local authorities. In addition to football's own issues around stadiums, it is unrealistic not to envisage large gatherings of supporters celebrating various on-field achievements.""West criticised Roberts's tone as too punitive, based on supporters being a public order problem. ""The language is of stark warnings being given about fans gathering, which is really disappointing. If the prime minister relaxes freedom to exercise and engage in leisure, it may be that people might attend near their home ground. As long as they do so in a safe way, I don't see a problem.""Roberts clarified he had not received firm proposals from the Premier League, whose clubs are awaiting the government's update on the lockdown, expected to be eased slightly on Sunday night, before clarifying their plans further at a meeting on Monday. Several clubs, including Brighton and            Aston Villa, have publicly stated opposition to neutral venues, arguing that playing at home better preserves sporting integrity and can be as safe as neutral venues. The EFL has said it does want to play matches at home grounds.Roberts, speaking to ITV, said football people talking about sporting integrity needed to consider the casualties of Covid-19: ""In the broader context, where the country has seen 30,000, and rising, deaths, some of the people making these comments need to get a grip because we've all got a responsibility - yes to make progress for the benefit of the country, but equally to do it in a way that minimises the risk that anything we do adds to that death toll.""",Newspaper

Like millions of working parents, my husband and I became temporary teachers when lockdown began on March 23 as a result of the coronavirus pandemic.What has saved us are the abundance of online learning programmes from the likes of BBC Bitesize, The Khan Academy and the new government-funded National Oak Academy, which streams 180 lessons a week. And, of course, there are YouTube lessons from celebrities, such as PE with Joe Wicks, maths with Carol Vorderman or history with Dan Snow. Yet it is not just traditional subjects that are taught digitally - there is a wealth of material on personal finance too for children of all ages.Experts say the lockdown is the perfect opportunity to give young people the financial skills they need for life. ""Most previous generations - including millennials and Generation Xers - were not taught about basic financial concepts, having to learn the hard way once they started working,"" says Adrian Lowcock, head of personal investing at Willis Owen. ""This could be our chance to change that. While none of us would choose to be stuck in our houses for an indefinite period, we have an opportunity now to ensure something positive comes out of this crisis. Teaching our kids new things - including the value of money - could be a real benefit to them.""Whether you're looking to introduce formal lessons under lockdown, shake up your children's savings or integrate learning about money more subtly into everyday family life, here is a wealth of ideas to inspire parents.Start giving pocket money Whether it is 50p or £5 a week, giving pocket money helps children learn about budgeting and spending decisions.""It doesn't matter how much you give your children, the act of paying regular pocket money helps open up conversations around money in the home,"" says Louise Hill, co-founder of GoHenry, one of a growing number of specialist contactless card apps for children and parents.Competitors include Rooster Money, Osper, Gimi and Otly. While fees and features vary, all of them help parents to educate children about the value of money while controlling what they're spending. The key, says Ms Hill, is to get children thinking about the four key pillars of money management: spend, save, earn, and give.Make them work for itAs well as giving them weeklypocket money, parents can pay theirchildrento complete tasks and chores- either via one of the above apps, orthe old-fashioned way in cash.The number one chore parentsreward via the Rooster Money app isTidying bedrooms - and the mostpopular ways children spend their""earnings"" are online computergames such as Roblox or Fortnite.parents. may have mixed feelingsabout monetising chores, but this canhelp youngsters learn where moneycomes from, that it has to be earned,and does not necessarily come easily.Sarah Coles, personal finance anal - lyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, saychildren of any age can do chores forcash. ""There are more of you makingthe place a mess at the moment, somore of you can clean up, and the kids"" can get some experience of earningmoney,"" she says.David Boyes from Wiltshire signed up his eight-year-old daughter Ciarafor the GoHenry app and has beenpaying her to do chores. He says:""Within weeks, Ciara has learnt thevalue of money. Before, she would askfor things with no concept of whatthey cost. Now that she is managingher own money, Ciara has becomevery conscious of what is going in andout of her account.""""  For smaller children, having a mable jar to fill - with the promise oftreats when it is full - works well as asimple rewards system. Good behaviour can earn marbles - bad behaviour will result in the threat of marbles being removed!Get them involved in household budgeting Building a budget encourages chil""en - and adults - to take a close look at their spending habits. This could be introduced from an early age via (an online) trip to the supermarket. Perhaps you could give them a set amount of money to see what they can buy on a budget. Older children could be challenged to make a meal - good practice for when they leave home, get a job or go to university.""It's very likely that we're all going to be working and learning from home for a considerable time yet,"" says Maike Currie, director at Fidelity International. ""Take this opportunity to teach your children about money. You don't need any textbooks - your kitchen (and lounge) is the best classroom.""""During lockdown, people may be paying closer attention to family budgets and avoiding unnecessary spending,"" says Becky O'Connor, personal finance specialist at Royal London. ""This is a good chance to apply maths to real life.""You could challenge children to find a better deal on mobile phone and broadband contracts, electricity suppliers or insurance and make them your in-house savings expert. To encourage them to do the research to find a deal, consider sharing some of the savings with them.Dig out their old savings accounts While stuck indoors, searching for paperwork and passwords for longforgotten children's savings accounts could be profitable. The first wave of Child Trust Funds will mature later this year, with about 400,000 teenagers becoming eligible to claim funds totalling around £700m.CTFs were set up predominantly to invest in stocks and shares, so children will be able to see how investments have performed over time - a great opportunity to get them interested in the stock market. You could also encourage them to transfer the money into an adult stocks and shares Isa.If you set up a Junior Isa for your child, be aware that the annual taxfree savings limit has just been raised to a very generous £9,000.For cash savings, challenge children to find out the rate of interest paid on old accounts, then research the best deals available.Play games Board games are an easy way to get children interested in money. You could try Monopoly - there are important financial lessons here, such as the importance of always keeping an emergency fund, managing cash flow and honing your negotiating skills. It naturally brings out lots of discussion (and arguments) over money and being the banker is great for mental arithmetic.Older children and young adults could try the FT's Road to Riches game, where they will be faced with dilemmas, including prioritising saving for a house deposit or a pension.The power of saving Saving for a long-term target helps teach children that resisting the temptation to spend immediately can lead to bigger rewards.""For older children, you could promise to pay a 'bonus' if they hit an agreed savings target. Or you could offer to double any money they put aside into savings,"" says Ms Coles. ""This will show them the benefits of saving towards their goals.""This could also give you an opportunity to explain how long-term savings vehicles such as Junior Isas work, and how the investments within them can help generate more money in the long run.Watch and learn The internet provides fun - and free - ways to teach your children about money.The KickStart Money programme is proving popular with parents and was set up after research found that our money habits as adults are set by the age of seven. Aimed at improving financial education among five to 11-year-olds, using videos, games and quizzes, the initiative is funded by 20 financial companies and overseen by charity MyBnk.Its financial education programme, Family Money Twist, is an easy way to encourage the youngest members of the household to learn to save and spend responsibly - with help from the Cookie Monster and a Saveo-saurus Rex. Its programme for 7-11 year olds is set to launch next week.Steve Korris, father of seven-yearold Matilda, has used Family Money Twist to introduce money to her and to start conversations about money at home. ""At school she has learnt coin recognition and maths sums, but nothing about how money works, value, income and savings,"" he says. ""She's very inquisitive so will definitely be asking questions now we've got her started.""Another free resource for teachers (adapted for home schooling) is the website of the Young Money charity. Parents can download free home learning guides covering everything from spending and budgeting to how student loans work.Children aged 4-19 can sign up for the Young Money Challenge and win £50 for themselves (and up to £500 for their school). This year's theme is how to be a responsible consumer.Delayed gratification One vital habit to develop and practice is finding ways to delay spending decisions. Many things that children (and adults) want badly in the moment seem less crucial if they just delay the purchase.""Telling kids that they can have that thing they want, but only if they still want it in a day or a week, is a technique that resolves a lot of impulse spending,"" says Greg Davies, head of behavioural science at consultancy Oxford Risk.The time it takes to save for something is a powerful indicator of its value for children who are old enough to receive pocket money. Tell them to divide the cost of the thing they want by the amount of their weekly allowance to work out how many weeks it will take them to save for it.""The thought of, say, eight weeks of waiting gives context to £40 - and might just put them off the item,"" says Ms O'Connor. However, be prepared for more enterprising children to ask for a pocket money pay raise.Another way of connecting time and the value of money is to divide large items up into the number of days you and your partner have had to work to afford them.""This way, they learn to equate the worth of possessions according to effort and to view things they want as reward for work,"" says Ms O'Connor.""If you explain to your child that it takes three days of work to earn, say, one PS4, they are able to understand the value of the item. Do this with houses and cars - calculating after tax for greater effect - and watch their mouths open in disbelief.""Set an example ""Never underestimate the impact your own money habits - good or bad - will have on your children,"" says Ms Currie.

You could also encourage them to transfer the money into an adult stocks and shares Isa.If you set up a Junior Isa for your child, be aware that the annual taxfree savings limit has just been raised to a very generous £9,000.For cash savings, challenge children to find out the rate of interest paid on old accounts, then research the best deals available.Play games Board games are an easy way to get children interested in money. You could try Monopoly - there are important financial lessons here, such as the importance of always keeping an emergency fund, managing cash flow and honing your negotiating skills. It naturally brings out lots of discussion (and arguments) over money and being the banker is great for mental arithmetic.Older children and young adults could try the FT's Road to Riches game, where they will be faced with dilemmas, including prioritising saving for a house deposit or a pension.The power of saving Saving for a long-term target helps teach children that resisting the temptation to spend immediately can lead to bigger rewards.""For older children, you could promise to pay a 'bonus' if they hit an agreed savings target. Or you could offer to double any money they put aside into savings,"" says Ms Coles. ""This will show them the benefits of saving towards their goals.""This could also give you an opportunity to explain how long-term savings vehicles such as Junior Isas work, and how the investments within them can help generate more money in the long run.Watch and learn The internet provides fun - and free - ways to teach your children about money.The KickStart Money programme is proving popular with parents and was set up after research found that our money habits as adults are set by the age of seven. Aimed at improving financial education among five to 11-year-olds, using videos, games and quizzes, the initiative is funded by 20 financial companies and overseen by charity MyBnk.Its financial education programme, Family Money Twist, is an easy way to encourage the youngest members of the household to learn to save and spend responsibly - with help from the Cookie Monster and a Saveo-saurus Rex. Its programme for 7-11 year olds is set to launch next week.Steve Korris, father of seven-yearold Matilda, has used Family Money Twist to introduce money to her and to start conversations about money at home. ""At school she has learnt coin recognition and maths sums, but nothing about how money works, value, income and savings,"" he says. ""She's very inquisitive so will definitely be asking questions now we've got her started.""Another free resource for teachers (adapted for home schooling) is the website of the Young Money charity. Parents can download free home learning guides covering everything from spending and budgeting to how student loans work.Children aged 4-19 can sign up for the Young Money Challenge and win £50 for themselves (and up to £500 for their school). This year's theme is how to be a responsible consumer.Delayed gratification One vital habit to develop and practice is finding ways to delay spending decisions. Many things that children (and adults) want badly in the moment seem less crucial if they just delay the purchase.""Telling kids that they can have that thing they want, but only if they still want it in a day or a week, is a technique that resolves a lot of impulse spending,"" says Greg Davies, head of behavioural science at consultancy Oxford Risk.The time it takes to save for something is a powerful indicator of its value for children who are old enough to receive pocket money. Tell them to divide the cost of the thing they want by the amount of their weekly allowance to work out how many weeks it will take them to save for it.""The thought of, say, eight weeks of waiting gives context to £40 - and might just put them off the item,"" says Ms O'Connor. However, be prepared for more enterprising children to ask for a pocket money pay raise.Another way of connecting time and the value of money is to divide large items up into the number of days you and your partner have had to work to afford them.""This way, they learn to equate the worth of possessions according to effort and to view things they want as reward for work,"" says Ms O'Connor.""If you explain to your child that it takes three days of work to earn, say, one PS4, they are able to understand the value of the item. Do this with houses and cars - calculating after tax for greater effect - and watch their mouths open in disbelief.""Set an example ""Never underestimate the impact your own money habits - good or bad - will have on your children,"" says Ms Currie. ""Describe what debt is, and the downward spiral that it can be.""You can talk to your children about your own experiences and interest rates associated with different financial products. This will be particularly beneficial to those who might be about to take on student loans.""If you teach them nothing else, make sure they have a firm understanding of the two Cs: compound interest and credit cards,"" she adds. ""If they understand the magical power of the former and the dangers of the latter, you're halfway there.""Talk about money In the current environment you may want to have some financial discussions in private, but in general, it's great to show children that money is not taboo by talking about it openly at home.However you try to teach children about the value of money the key thing is not to make it boring, says Ms Coles. ""You can do more harm than good if you march them through a preset lesson under time pressure and with you both in a state of high stress.""If you have time to teach your kids about money, this is a brilliant opportunity to do so, but if you don't have time or space for it, then the handsoff methods may make a great deal more sense.""Money matters Financial education will have an important role to play in preparing children for an uncertain future, says the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS), warning that young people stand to be the group that is most economically affected by the fallout of the pandemic.A lack of preparedness for the unexpected has shown that money lessons matter, says Greg Davies, head of behavioural science at consultancy Oxford Risk.""Levels of financial resilience in the UK are extremely low, with large portions of the population with little or no savings buffer to tide them through unexpected emergencies,"" he explains.He points out that a large proportion of the UK population lack the functional skills and knowledge to manage their money.""Since we're now in the midst of such an emergency, the importance of financial resilience and financial capability is becoming painfully apparent.""However, building financial capability takes time, and requires developing effective money management habits. ""The earlier such behaviours can be inculcated, the better,"" Mr Davies adds.Even though many young people say they wish they had learned more about money and finance at school, it has never risen far up the agenda.Myron Jobson, personal finance campaigner at Interactive Investor, says: ""In a packed curriculum, financial education competes for space with many other topics and it is not compulsory in academies, private schools or faith schools. But with many families now taking a much more hands-on role in home learning, there's more flexibility to talk about money management.""Top 10 things children spend pocket money on during lockdown 1.

574,Gillian Bowditch: Nicola and Boris must heed national consensus for a route out of lockdown;Different roads out of lockdown across the UK would kill our consensus,"May 9, 2020 Saturday",International,thetimes.co.uk,891,891,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,Gillian Bowditch,Gillian Bowditch: Nicola and Boris must heed national consensus for a route out of lockdownDifferent roads out of lockdown across the UK would kill our consensus,"What could induce you to break lockdown? Not that I'm advocating it, you understand but we all have our tipping point.For Catherine Calderwood, the former chief medical officer for Scotland, it was family trips to her holiday cottage. For Professor Neil Ferguson, the government advisor, it was trysts with his lover Antonia Staats - his vital Staats, so to speak.I'm ashamed to say that for me it would be a session with my hairdresser. When Boris's baby arrived with a full head of quarantine hair, it was a clear sign from the gods that the nation's hairdressers needed to get back to work.As the late Margo MacDonald knew, you should never underestimate the restorative power of a good cut and colour. That hairdressers may feel differently about the risks needed to service the vanity of others is entirely understandable.Everyone's thoughts are turning to loosening lockdown. The Scottish government has started a consultation exercise with the public to see what they would like lifted first. The answer appears to be golf.But what is striking is that for every person desperate to hug a grandchild, there are plenty who do not want to see lockdown lifted until a proven treatment or vaccine is developed. The big lesson from this pandemic is how quickly and easily people have adapted to the restrictions placed on their lives.Faced with the message that a previously unknown, untreatable and, for some, deadly virus is sweeping the globe and that the safest place to be is isolated indoors, it is hardly surprising that people are reluctant to play lockdown roulette.Loss-aversion theory comes into play here, too. First advanced by the psychologists Amos Tversky and Nobel laureate Daniel Kahneman, in 1979, it proposes that losing something affects us more strongly than gaining something of equal value. Losing £100 will make you feel up to twice as bad as winning £100 makes you feel good because we weigh negative events more than positive ones. Innately, we gravitate towards minimising our losses rather than maximising our gains.But as more information comes to light about the virus, a growing cohort is questioning the severity of lockdown, the factors that make a difference to the progress and intensity of Covid-19, and the reliability of the model on which government advice has been based.Consensus among sceptics is as prevalent as hen's dentures, however. Without total transparency around the scientific advice, the original code used in the modelling, and trends in the spread and severity of the disease, it is difficult to see how agreement can be reached.This is a dangerous time in the pandemic, not because of academic dissent or any splintering of resolve on our part, but because the fragile détente among politicians is fracturing.The SNP government's roadmap to power is predicated on a sense of Scottish exceptionalism and in some instances they have been right. Our geography and demography mean that in certain situations Scottish problems need, if not Scottish solutions, then different solutions. But these are few and far between. The response to the coronavirus outbreak is certainly not one of them.Nicola Sturgeon has (politically) outlived two prime ministers. There is nothing clubbable about her and she has perfected the through-gritted-teeth approach to cooperation with Westminster. Boris has gone out of his way to be rude and antagonistic about her in the past.There has been a degree of depressing but predictable petty one-upmanship over the past few weeks, which most of us have been prepared to overlook because running a government at present is nobody's idea of a picnic.But throughout history, collaborative solutions to mutual problems have been the bedrock of progress. If ever there were a time for the wisdom of crowds, it is now.A fundamentally different approach to loosening lockdown in Scotland and England would be disastrous, not just because of the confusion and resentment it would cause. Or because of the additional difficulties businesses that operate across the border would face. But because it would squander the one positive in this crisis - a sense of unity and togetherness.Ultimately, we all face different risks and we all have different approaches to risk. Individuals must be allowed to make their own assessment of the risk to themselves and their loved ones within the official parameters.But in a pandemic that has been characterised by speculation based on poor, confusing and incomplete data, the public has been united in its approach. Communities have come together to support vulnerable members without any need of government direction or organisation. Businesses have supported each other. Networks have sprung up.The hallmark of this pandemic has been cooperation, collectivism, accessibility and positivity. There will be a time for inquiry and examination, but it is not now. We went into this as one and we should come out of it together. If the national consensus is breached for reasons of political point scoring, both leaders will find it harder to manage in the long run.You cannot put a kilt on coronavirus. Nobody governs in isolation in a pandemic. Getting into bed with the prime minister may well be the first minister's personal tipping point. But the inconvenient truth is that Nicola needs Boris and Boris needs Nicola.@GillianBowditch",Web Publication
575,"Mission critical: make people want to spend, spend, spend;Ending the lockdown is just the first step to rebuilding consumer confidence","May 9, 2020 Saturday",International,thetimes.co.uk,1538,1538,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,John Collingridge | Jill Treanor | Sam Chambers | Sabah Meddings,"Mission critical: make people want to spend, spend, spendEnding the lockdown is just the first step to rebuilding consumer confidence","At car showrooms across the country, yellow tape markings, Perspex screens and hand sanitiser stations await customers coming in for test drives. Where once barista-staffed coffee bars and children's play areas were among the perks designed to ""sell the sizzle"" and tempt customers to make the second-biggest purchase of their lives, now hygiene has become the key feature.""There's a health crisis and there will be an economic crisis,"" said Alison Jones, UK managing director of Peugeot, Citroën and DS. ""We need to get the economy moving. Health is the main priority - but we've found a way to work safely.""The car industry is just one of many retail sectors now wrestling with a crucial question: they might be ready to reopen, but how do they flip consumers' psychological switches and persuade them to open their wallets again?The lockdown and social distancing have brought household spending - which makes up 60% of economic output - to a juddering halt. As shops, cinemas, car dealerships, pubs and restaurants pulled down the shutters, so too did consumers. Data from Visa shows household spending is down by about 30%. The housing market is on hold, with listings and sales down more than 80%, according to Zoopla. Car sales crashed 97% last month, according to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders. Savings are rising as households squirrel away cash.Last week, the Bank of England laid bare the devastation this will wreak on the economy. The UK is braced for the worst recession in 300 years, it warned, with output crashing as much as 30% in the first half of the year and two million people set to lose their jobs. Even when the lockdown is eased, a ""degree of precautionary behaviour by households and businesses is assumed to persist"", it said.Coaxing consumers out of hibernation is one of the most vexing issues facing the economy. It will help define what shape the recovery takes: whether there is a sudden, sharp bounceback in the second half of the year, creating a V-shaped graph, or whether a self-perpetuating cycle of grim economic news results in a slow, attritional U-shaped trudge out.The starting point is bleak. The government's ""Stay at home, protect the NHS, save lives"" slogan helped prevent hospitals from becoming overwhelmed, but in the weeks of lockdown it has also sown a deep-rooted fear of normal activities.Shaking hands is an inconceivable faux pas. Shoppers instinctively give each other a wide berth in the aisles at Tesco. Footage of crowded pubs and trains from before lockdown looks alien. Persuading people that going out can be safe will require significant mental rewiring.""People adjust very quickly to new ways of life,"" said George Buckley, chief UK economist at Nomura. ""It's going to be very difficult to get people back into parts of the economy where social distancing needs to be actively used.""There will be a worry factor about going into pubs and using public transport. If you don't need to do it, why would you do it? It's going to take a long time for people to go back into restaurants and theatres - not from the supply side but from the demand side.""A recent survey by Ipsos Mori showed that more than 60% of people would be uncomfortable returning to bars and restaurants, using public transport or going to a large event. ""People [in the West] tend to overreact and overestimate the fatality and infection rates,"" said Michele Belot, a behavioural economist at the European University Institute in Italy. Its research shows Britons believe that 23% of people in their local area are, or have been, infected with Covid-19, versus 14% in South Korea. The actual rate in both countries is thought to be much lower.Professor David Spiegelhalter, a statistician at Cambridge University, told the BBC last week: ""We do need to have some sort of campaign to encourage people who are very low-risk to get out and start living again, when we are able to.""But living - and spending - will look very different. At car dealerships, customers who brave the trip will sit at least two metres away from the salesperson, possibly separated by a sheet of Perspex and wearing facemasks. Andy Barratt, managing director of Ford in Britain, said it would make any car sale ""a sanitised, mechanical process"".He added: ""You've got to work out how to get the emotion, and that may be selling the sizzle through video. You want to build rapport, trust and loyalty.""Test drives will be either done alone, guided by an app, or with the salesperson sitting in the back-left seat. Peugeot and Vauxhall dealerships will insist on a three-hour gap between test drives of each car to allow for deep cleaning.Forms will be signed electronically. Customers who do not want to enter a branch will be given virtual tours of vehicles, and cars will be delivered to their homes. ""Radical progression comes in the face of adversity,"" said Barratt. ""The dealers have digitised much more quickly. The market has to come back.""A similar story of sanitised selling is taking shape in sectors from fashion to hotels. The coronavirus has left the world awash with unsold clothes. Retailers will have to shift stockpiled spring/summerwear as quickly as possible - but with so many brands on sale, discounting will lose its power, while social distancing will result in a struggle to handle surges in demand at stores or warehouses around the time of Black Friday and Christmas.InterContinental Hotels Group, owner of Holiday Inn, plans to put cleaning kits in rooms, install screens at check-in desks and visibly sanitise communal areas.""We are going to highlight what we do and make sure there are visible cues throughout the hotel,"" said chief executive Keith Barr. ""We're going to look at the customer journey, including the future of buffets. Will they still exist?""All that extra friction will increase the likelihood that consumers are put off buying things they do not need. That will be a big problem for all retailers of ""discretionary"" - non-urgent - goods.""You need to re-convince people of the importance of things they've forgotten about,"" said Roger Parry, chairman of polling company YouGov. ""That third flavour of yoghurt they haven't bought in a while: it's reminding people they get pleasure from unnecessary things.""But hopes of a recovery in spending are set against a troubling backdrop. A rising tide of job losses, such as 18,000 announced at Virgin Atlantic, British Airways and Ryanair in the past fortnight, coupled with stagnant wages, is likely to further depress sentiment. Hours will be cut. Google Trends data shows searches for ""redundancy"" and ""mortgage holiday"" have spiked in recent weeks.Those who have not been furloughed or lost their jobs have become forced or willing savers. Simon French at Panmure Gordon said that during times of unemployment, precautionary savings rise. He calculates there are more than 55.5 million consumers in the UK. Of those, seven million have ""cyclical"" jobs in industries such as manufacturing, whose fortunes rise and fall with the wider economy - and are particularly sensitive to economic sentiment. ""They are the bellwether that will determine whether this is a V-shaped recovery in terms of consumer spending or much more of a U-shaped recovery,"" said French.Swathes of households face financial difficulty, especially as mortgage holidays, the furlough scheme and other payment breaks come to an end next month. Capital Economics estimates that two million mortgage holidays have been granted, while claims for universal credit have rocketed. Debt charity StepChange warned that the self-employed and sole traders, who last struggled during the financial crisis, were also at risk of being dragged into difficulty.All that will heap pressure on ministers and the Bank to do more to stimulate the economy via measures such as VAT cuts, a stamp duty holiday and quantitative easing. Car firms want a scrappage scheme and state-funded discounts to get consumers to buy new, low-emission models.Former Tesco boss Sir Terry Leahy called for regulations to be slashed to free up business investment. ""Take housing,"" Leahy said. ""If you were able to build 300,000 homes rather than 100,000, that greatly increases the supply, houses become more affordable, and those house moves make a big difference in terms of consumer spending.""If there is to be a recovery, it must be supported by clear and reassuring messages about safety from the government, said Belot. Countries such as China and South Korea have been able to lift their lockdowns in part because previous epidemics, such as Sars, meant that they already had systems to handle the crisis.""Everything has to do with reassuring people there are public safety measures in place,"" said Belot. ""What is troubling for people is that they do not really see how the year ahead will go. Uncertainty is very bad for consumption and investment. Some countries are more successful than others when it comes to reassurance about a long-term plan. When I talk to people in Asia, they are a lot less worried, because there are protocols in place to respond to possible new outbreaks.""Here, I am not really sure that people are reassured about the way the crisis has been handled.""",Web Publication
576,Britons switched from 'pleasure-seeking' to 'pain-avoiding' mentality during coronavirus pandemic;A professor at the London School of Economics said the virus had changed the mindset and individual habits of most people,"May 9, 2020 Saturday",International,telegraph.co.uk,384,384,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,By Dominic Penna,Britons switched from 'pleasure-seeking' to 'pain-avoiding' mentality during coronavirus pandemicA professor at the London School of Economics said the virus had changed the mindset and individual habits of most people,"Britons have switched from a ""pleasure-seeking"" to ""pain-avoiding"" mentality during the coronavirus pandemic, according to a psychologist who predicts that some behavioural changes linked to the virus could become permanent.Ben Voyer, professor of psychological and behavioural science at the London School of Economics, said the virus had changed the mindset and individual habits of most people.The longer social distancing and other restrictions remain in place, the more likely it is that the associated behavioural changes will become permanent, he has said.""Generally speaking we have evolved to seek pleasure and avoid pain. In a pandemic, you suddenly shift from promotion to prevention - you pay much more attention to what could go wrong, and that change of mindset affects a lot of decisions you are making,"" Prof Voyer said.""This is likely to perdure until visible reminders of the pandemic are gone - that is, until social distancing and all things described as 'new normal' stay in place.""He said that this focus on avoiding pain explained the stockpiling of lavatory paper. While behavioural changes are likely to be temporary, he said that the longer restrictions are in place, the more this will affect habits long-term.""If by September we are back to normal life, it is unlikely a lot of the things we have had to change to cope with the last few weeks will stay,"" he said. ""But if it stays over 12 months or more this will have a more long-term effect.""Prof Voyer said that the focus on cash-free transactions during lockdown could hasten the process of Britain becoming a cash-free society.""The divide in consumer use of cash is already generational - with older people using more cash than younger people,"" he said.""The fact that vulnerable people are asked to keep sheltering while younger ones rejoin the working force could mean that shops accelerate the transition as they find consumers readily accepting this and being able to use dematerialised payment.""In addition, vulnerable people may find it is perhaps better for them to adopt a different form of payment to be and feel safer.""He added that if further research found that the use of banknotes does not significantly contribute to the spread of coronavirus, this could mean that people revert to old habits of using cash.",Newspaper; Web Publication

Here, we learnt our lesson during the 2003 Sars outbreak, when the death rate after infection among nursing home residents was as high as 80%.In our densely packed population of 7.5 million we have seen just over 1,000 cases of Covid-19, only four deaths and no cross-infections in healthcare workers and patients. Our 80,000 nursing home residents have been kept safe.How did we achieve this? Simple: personal protective equipment (PPE). Facemasks are worn by all healthcare workers and nursing home staff. Moreover, 90% facemask compliance among our citizens means we do not need to be locked down. Schools are closed, but our citizens are still taking the metro every day.The UK government should ease the lockdown and tell people to wear masks when out. It is not rocket science.                   Dr Elsie Hui, consultant geriatrician, Hong Kong                    Hancock's half-truth                    Your leader congratulates the health secretary on hitting his 100,000 testing target (Editorial, last week). He did not. The number of people tested was 73,191. The 122,000 he claimed included tests sent out, rather than performed - many of which had no return address.Had Matt Hancock stated that he set a target, fell short but still achieved a huge uplift in testing, he would have commanded respect. Instead he manipulated the criteria, and your congratulations are misplaced and misleading.                    Andrew Crane, Tunbridge Wells                    LACK OF PPE KILLED OUR COLLEAGUES                   At the time of writing, at least 185 health and social care workers have died of Covid-19. These were our friends, mentors and peers, and we are gravely concerned that recent guidance from the chief coroner places limits on the investigation of shortages of personal protective equipment (PPE) at inquests into their deaths.We acknowledge that, as a matter of law, an inquest is not the forum to examine systemic failures in the national provision of PPE, but these matters must not be overlooked. Unless a judge-led public inquiry is announced, inquests are the only way for the families and friends of our dead colleagues to ask questions and seek answers.Therefore, the chief coroner should ensure that local availability of PPE will be considered in every single inquest of a healthcare worker who has died from suspected or confirmed Covid-19.Throughout the coronavirus crisis there has been a gulf between World Health Organisation (WHO) guidance and Public Health England guidance on minimum PPE for healthcare workers. We have not been supplied with any evidence to explain the rejection of WHO recommendations.We believe that lack of PPE has contributed to the deaths of our colleagues, and that a failure to appropriately contextualise their deaths will place healthcare workers at unnecessary risk in future.

I am classified as ""extremely vulnerable"": over 70, with rheumatoid arthritis, a suppressed immune system, a replacement hip and knees. My quality-adjusted life year (Qaly) score would be low. Yet I still have a life to live.Since my diagnosis and joint replacements, I have hiked in the Andes, tracked snow leopards in Siberia and been wild camping in Sudan. Watching the sun rise over the dunes, I have never felt more alive.Now I am being advised that I can sit by an open window to get some fresh air, and that I must be careful not to fall over when I go out to clap for carers. To continue this for an extended length of time would be the kiss of death. Preserving life at any cost would make that life not worth living.                   Sue Fleckney, Grantham, Lincolnshire                   Sowing fear                   The argument that over-70s should be asked to endure prolonged lockdown restrictions to ""protect the NHS"" from having to treat them (News, last week) runs counter to the idea of a health service freely available to all. Has the same idea been considered for the obese?The real problem is that the government has invested next to nothing to prepare for end of lockdown, as its abysmal record on testing shows, and now it thinks it can simply cow the elderly by sowing fear.My generation will not be imprisoned when it has committed no crime.                   Eric Chalker (81), Hildenborough, Kent                    Talk to us                   Our government should realise that its electors of all ages are capable of adult conversation, and consult us on what we might wish for our lives: longer, lonelier and lacking human touch, or perhaps shorter and more satisfying.                   Annette Lawson, London W9                    Patronising views                   You quote the behavioural scientist Andrew Oswald saying older people ""have no idea of the danger they are in"". I have news for him. We read papers, watch television and have a better perception of living this life than he thinks - and we find his view arrogant and offensive.                   Colin Little (72¾), Great Missenden, Buckinghamshire                    Difference a day makes                   Jen Bouchet (Letters, last week) is digusted by the over-70s complaining of lockdown. I turned 70 the day her letter was published. What is so special about the ""0""? Why on May 3 did I become such a ""selfish"" risk to NHS staff, when I wasn't on May 2?There is no scientific reason for a healthy, slim, sensible 70-year-old to be considered a greater risk to the NHS than an overweight 55-year old - who attended a rugby match in March, after it was clear that Covid-19 was spreading round the UK, and bragged about shaking hands.                   Professor Jennifer Jenkins, London SW2                   CALL IN THE REAL CRISIS EXPERTS                   The setting-up of a rival to the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) raises some interesting questions about the government's management of the Covid-19 crisis (News, last week).Now the identity of most members of Sage is public, we can see that to be appointed it is better to have a knighthood, or at least to be an OBE, than to have expertise in managing emergencies. Some of the documents produced by Sage show a disturbing lack of understanding of the dynamics of managing a large crisis. The science is only part of the scenario. For example, medical science advice will not be of much help when it comes to supply-chain management or fraud prevention.Many emergency planners have told me they have been sidelined or ignored. The UK has plenty of experts in this field, but it has a habit of undervaluing them. The result is frantic improvisation, often with tragic consequences.I hope that in future the advisers on either committee will be chosen with a more realistic vision of what advice is actually needed.                   Professor David Alexander, Institute for Risk and Disaster Reduction, University College London                   HANGING OUT IN THE GARDEN                   Your leader on naked gardening day (last week) hints at an important truth: social isolation has caused an explosion in naked living. During lockdown our naked yoga classes and virtual naked pub have attracted thousands; for many others, working from home means working naked. With so many now enjoying the freedom that nudity brings, don't be surprised to see many more naked gardeners when lockdown is lifted.                   Mark Bass, president, British Naturism                   SEATING PLAN FOR TOMORROW'S WORLD                   The proposals put forward to reduce the supply of seats on the rail system to less than 20% will be nearly impossible to put into place - and even harder to sustain (News, last week). With our very ""wide"" commuting peaks, lasting three hours, draconian measures will be needed, such as staggering not only travel times but travel days. For some site jobs, like construction, this simply will not be possible.One solution could be giving permission to travel by rail to specific categories of key workers who cannot feasibly work from home. If one assumes that 60% of rail traffic and Tube use is commuting, then we need to calculate whether the essential key worker demand matches the restricted supply of seats. I suspect the match will be very close indeed.This long-term disruption may change travel patterns for a lifetime. It is very likely that some of those who used to commute will never do so again.

So how will governments and individuals weigh the difficult daily decisions facing us when we leave lockdown? ; Against the odds","L ast month, Dayna Polehanki, a Michigan state senator, posted a tweet from the capitol building in Lansing that might have seemed unimaginable only recently.""Directly above me, men with rifles yelling at us,"" it read, next to a picture of armed protesters standing in the building, demanding an end to the Covid-19 lockdown in the name of ""freedom"". ""Some of my colleagues who own bulletproof vests are wearing them."" It might be tempting to see this as just another sign of American political polarisation. But that would be a profound mistake. Over this bizarre and frightening scene hang questions that will affect us all in the coming months, be that in Lansing, London, Lagos or Lisbon: how do we define and measure risk? Who gets to do that? And who deals with the implications? After all, as Covid-19 subsides, public officials around the world will have to decide when it is ""safe"" to restart life.Millions of individuals will have to make their own judgments too, based on data about health, age and external risks: is it safe to go to the shops? See a friend? Board a plane? These will be tough decisions, given that the disease has already produced an estimated global death toll of quarter of a million and is so infectious that most affected countries have struggled to reduce the transmission rate (or R) below 1 (whereby on average the number of new infections caused by each sufferer is less than one, so that the disease dies away).Most of us like to think that such decisions will be driven by medical science. Some might also acknowledge economic trade-offs, as we measure the cost of epidemics against the equally severe price of recession. (Or, as one Wall Street luminary pithily notes, the challenge of finding a balance between being ""compassionate"" and ""pragmatic"".) And the decisions will undoubtedly be presented with reams of supposedly neutral data, risk models and forecasts.But statistics only capture part of the tale. I have spent much of my career writing about finance, and during the 2008 financial crisis I saw at first hand how deceptive our trust in models can be. Societies are not like a Newtonian physics equation, where people act with the predictability of gravity; humans have psychological biases, cultural assumptions and inconsistent incentives. When these are ignored - as they often have been by financiers - they can derail forecasts and risk analyses. Culture matters.So too for medicine. Health data can project when we might ""flatten the curve"" of an epidemic, to cite the catchphrase of 2020. Medical science can reveal death rates and frame mortality risks. But models cannot tell us when and how we might feel safe. As social scientists Mary Douglas and Aaron Wildavsky pointed out in their seminal 1983 book Risk and Culture, ""The perception of risk is a social process.""Nor can those models answer the most crucial questions of all: should our risk decisions be made by individuals? By leaders? Or the community? And if the last of these, where do our community boundaries now lie? Covid-19, in other words, raises often ignored issues of trust and power and will force us to confront them - sometimes even at the point of a gun.Epidemics have long plagued humanity. But western attitudes to riskmanagement have undergone a stealthy revolution in recent centuries. Until the Renaissance in Europe, as the economic historian Peter Bernstein notes in his book Against the Gods, it was generally assumed that our fate sat in the lap of deities. And while prayer might influence the future, disasters - such as the Black Death - seemed unfathomably hard to predict.But in the 16th century, European intellectuals such as Gerolamo Cardano and Pierre de Fermat used numbering systems originally formulated by Arab cultures to develop advanced maths - and, most crucially, theories of probability. These were honed in subsequent centuries, and turbocharged after the second world war thanks to computing power, creating the modern risk-management industry. The advent of Big Data has now elevated this even further.""The ability to define what may happen in the future and to choose among alternatives lies at the heart of contemporary societies,"" writes Bernstein, who posits this as the key element dividing modern and premodern societies. ""Risk Continued on page 2 Continued from page 1 management guides us over a vast range of decision-making, from allocating wealth to safeguarding public health, from waging war to planning a family, from paying insurance premiums to wearing a seatbelt, from planting corn to marketing cornflakes.""Today, these probability-based forecasting tools are so ubiquitous - particularly in fields such as finance - that they feel completely ""natural"", if not inevitable, to westerners. Thus we often forget how unusual this approach to risk is in the sweep of human history. We also tend to overlook the fact that our minds have not ""caught up"" with those models in terms of how we evaluate risk. For one thing, humans do not always perceive the passage of time as consistently as a computer. Psychology experiments show that we vastly overemphasise short-term rewards and risks compared with long-term ones (creating a phenomenon that behavioural economists call ""hyperbolic discounting""). Similarly, we attach more weight to risks that appear directly in our line of vision. In a city such as New York, where I live, there is obsessive media coverage of the Covid-19 crisis, which has killed some 65,000 people so far in America. But previously there was little focus on seasonal flu (which killed 34,000 in the US in the 2018-19 season, according to the CDC); nor on traffic accidents, diabetes or smoking, which respectively kill around 36,000, 84,000 and 480,000 each year.""Societies and organisations are defined not so much by what risks they identify and manage, but by what they decide - whether willingly or reluctantly - to ignore,"" says Anette Mikes, a riskmanagement expert at Saïd Business School. ""Human beings are very good at using their senses to detect threats in their immediate environment,"" echoes Hugh Gusterson, an anthropologist who has studied the US nuclear industry. ""Humans are not so good at being aware of more abstract threats, even though they are often far more serious.""Another distorting factor is our social boundaries. We often - and wrongly - define ""danger"" as something outside our social group, and downplay internal threats. When Donald Trump described Covid-19 as the ""Chinese virus"", he was following a well-worn historical path of resorting to xenophobia in a time of disease. Or as Kristin Hedges and Michael Ennis-McMillan, two medical anthropologists, note in a recent paper: ""The human tendency to divide society into 'us' and 'others' when fear strikes becomes especially prevalent during infectious disease epidemics.""Structures of power and trust also matter. Back in 2008, we learnt that while financial models appeared to be based on universal principles of maths, they were created and used in different ways by different ""tribes"" of financiers.Similarly, our sense of risk in an epidemic is shaped by the question of who we think has the responsibility for handing it. Mikes, for example, identifies four overlapping patterns in how different social groups handle risk. Sometimes it is considered the responsibility of individuals to manage risk (under the principle of caveat emptor). On other occasions there is a more egalitarian approach: everyone in a community voluntarily tries to protect everyone else. A third framework uses hierarchical controls: leaders manage risk by issuing orders. Then there is a fourth option: fatalism, when nobody tries to manage risks at all.In peaceful times, we do not often define which of these four approaches we rely on to keep us safe; or not unless we work in jobs explicitly focused on measuring or trading risk, such as finance (where the concept of caveat emptor often collides with hierarchical rules). But Covid-19 crystallises this. Some of us may want to handle the dangers of an epidemic in an individualistic way, like those Lansing protesters. Others, such as the governor of Michigan, Gretchen Whitmer, who imposed the lockdown, think that hierarchical controls are needed. Nearly all of us probably have an egalitarian instinct too: we want to avoid infecting ourselves and each other. But few citizens - let alone politicians - want to stipulate explicitly how anyone should prioritise these approaches. Nor do many want to resort to the fourth option: fatalism.So where does that leave governments and citizens? In a state of confusing flux, it seems, in most countries. Take America. Its founding mythology is built on the principle of individual freedom and an ideal of the individualistic management of risk. Many citizens still embrace that: this week, for example, social media has buzzed with the tale of a hairdresser in Texas who is being sent to prison for keeping her salon open amid the enforced lockdown.But this is a rarity: most individuals recognise that pandemics are a group threat. So, in most states, there has been a sliding towards a form of hierarchical risk management in recent weeks, with lockdowns, travel bans and other controls. Moreover, members of the White House Covid-19 advisory task force have been surprised - and delighted - by the high levels of compliance.What is even more striking is the rise of egalitarian risk management in the US. Consider masks. These have long been used by the populations of many Asian countries, such as Japan and China, to prevent infected people from spreading disease or creating risks for others. That reflects their collectivist traditions (and experience of the Sars epidemic of the early 2000s).Until a couple of weeks ago, masks were almost never used in this way in New York. Now, however, it has become mandatory in crowded spaces. And what is notable is that there is rising social pressure to use masks, even in places where they are not mandatory. ""Dear Jogger, Bicycle douchebag, Yuppie/Millennial, Narcissist Swine,"" declared a sign this week in Brooklyn. ""Put on your fucking mask! Please respect your community and the lives of others. You do not live alone!"" There is also peer pressure to observe social distancing: self-styled citizen activists have used drones to monitor spaces, posting pictures of crowds on Florida beaches with disapproving comments. Stories are circulating on social media about citizens in New York or Florida reporting their neighbours to the police for ""crimes"" such as secretly employing hairdressers at home.Moreover, the US is not the only place where egalitarian risk controls are spreading. In the Czech Republic, the wearing of masks was not previously a feature of everyday life. But, notes Gusterson, ""almost all Czechs now wear face masks amid the coronavirus crisis because of an extraordinary grassroots movement that has incited mass homemanufacture of masks that are left on trees for anyone to take.The movement, whose slogan is 'my mask protects you; your mask protects me', has, in just a few weeks, made those who do not wear masks appear selfish and antisocial."" Sweden, by contrast, previously had a stronger tradition of egalitarian risk management: even without hierarchical controls or a lockdown, people have been practising voluntary social distancing. So too in Singapore.In Britain the pattern is almost as confused - and conflicted - as in the US.When the crisis first hit in March, the government embraced the fourth model of risk control, namely fatalism, with prime minister Boris Johnson famously declaring that ""many more families are going to lose loved ones"".But then Britain abruptly adopted hierarchical risk controls, and introduced rules that are in most respects tougher than those in New York, say.Some London friends of mine have also embraced tight individualistic risk controls, taking measures that are unseen in New York, such as ""quarantining"" delivery packages before introducing them into the house. However, British citizens have not embraced the idea of using face masks to prevent infected people from spreading disease.This might yet shift again. When a society switches into crisis mode, notes Mikes, it ""tends to bring to the surface irreconcilable conflicts between values that in normal circumstances are invisible"". So too in an exit, if not more so. ""In many ways, lockdown is intellectually easy ... as a remedy it is clear-cut. The exit strategy is much less clear.""In one scenario that might play out in the coming months, a climate of fear creates more desire for hierarchical risk management; governments would be expected to manage health risks to an increasing degree. But it is also possible to imagine a rebellion in a place such as America, whereby the burden of risk is handed back to the individual. Or a sense of fatalism might emerge, if the economic price of pandemic control spirals too high. There are precedents: Americans are wearily used to the idea that 40,000 die each year from guns, and many accept this as the price of freedom.Technology further muddies the issue. In China, tech companies have already developed a phone app that can be used to track whether someone has had Covid-19, or not, with the results displayed like a traffic light. This is used for hierarchical risk-management control: the government will permit travel, say, if the app is green. Some Silicon Valley whizz-kids are seeking to copy this (even though it is unclear whether people who have had Covid-19 have immunity). The British government is producing another twist on this idea: a tracking and tracing app.This might yet reinforce hierarchical controls in the west, as in China. But a ""traffic light"" app could - in theory - also be used to help individuals manage their own risk (by checking on the health of others) or to promote egalitarian protections (by telling individuals when they need to isolate and/or monitoring the health of a group).Apps might also open our eyes to other risks we currently ignore, such as ""normal"" flu. They could redefine our social boundaries. After all, the Covid-19 crisis has already forced us to define who is ""inside"" or ""outside"", be that at a household, communal, ethnic or national level. If we create apps to track the health of these groups, those boundaries will be further entrenched.Where might this lead? My own best guess is that in countries such as the US and UK, we are heading towards a future with more emphasis on egalitarian risk control but within social boundaries; keeping our ""tribe"" safe will be the new mantra. But the key point to note is this: ""The word 'risk' hails from the early Italian risicare, which means 'to dare',"" as Bernstein said. ""In this sense, risk is a choice rather than a fate."" Moreover, how we make that choice defines ""what it means to be human"". Let us hope we can make those choices wisely.Gillian Tett is chair of the FT's US editorial boardMillions will have to make their own judgments: is it safe to go to the shops? See a friend?

580,"Against the odds;Humans have long had a complicated relationship with risk, says Gillian Tett. So how will governments and individuals weigh the difficult daily decisions facing us when we leave lockdown? ; Against the odds","May 9, 2020 Saturday",International,"Financial Times (London, England)",2535,2535,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,Gillian Tett,"Against the oddsHumans have long had a complicated relationship with risk, says Gillian Tett. So how will governments and individuals weigh the difficult daily decisions facing us when we leave lockdown? ; Against the odds","L ast month, Dayna Polehanki, a Michigan state senator, posted a tweet from the capitol building in Lansing that might have seemed unimaginable only recently.""Directly above me, men with rifles yelling at us,"" it read, next to a picture of armed protesters standing in the building, demanding an end to the Covid-19 lockdown in the name of ""freedom"". ""Some of my colleagues who own bulletproof vests are wearing them."" It might be tempting to see this as just another sign of American political polarisation. But that would be a profound mistake. Over this bizarre and frightening scene hang questions that will affect us all in the coming months, be that in Lansing, London, Lagos or Lisbon: how do we define and measure risk? Who gets to do that? And who deals with the implications? After all, as Covid-19 subsides, public officials around the world will have to decide when it is ""safe"" to restart life.Millions of individuals will have to make their own judgments too, based on data about health, age and external risks: is it safe to go to the shops? See a friend? Board a plane? These will be tough decisions, given that the disease has already produced an estimated global death toll of quarter of a million and is so infectious that most affected countries have struggled to reduce the transmission rate (or R) below 1 (whereby on average the number of new infections caused by each sufferer is less than one, so that the disease dies away).Most of us like to think that such decisions will be driven by medical science. Some might also acknowledge economic trade-offs, as we measure the cost of epidemics against the equally severe price of recession. (Or, as one Wall Street luminary pithily notes, the challenge of finding a balance between being ""compassionate"" and ""pragmatic"".) And the decisions will undoubtedly be presented with reams of supposedly neutral data, risk models and forecasts.But statistics only capture part of the tale. I have spent much of my career writing about finance, and during the 2008 financial crisis I saw at first hand how deceptive our trust in models can be. Societies are not like a Newtonian physics equation, where people act with the predictability of gravity; humans have psychological biases, cultural assumptions and inconsistent incentives. When these are ignored - as they often have been by financiers - they can derail forecasts and risk analyses. Culture matters.So too for medicine. Health data can project when we might ""flatten the curve"" of an epidemic, to cite the catchphrase of 2020. Medical science can reveal death rates and frame mortality risks. But models cannot tell us when and how we might feel safe. As social scientists Mary Douglas and Aaron Wildavsky pointed out in their seminal 1983 book Risk and Culture, ""The perception of risk is a social process.""Nor can those models answer the most crucial questions of all: should our risk decisions be made by individuals? By leaders? Or the community? And if the last of these, where do our community boundaries now lie? Covid-19, in other words, raises often ignored issues of trust and power and will force us to confront them - sometimes even at the point of a gun.Epidemics have long plagued humanity. But western attitudes to riskmanagement have undergone a stealthy revolution in recent centuries. Until the Renaissance in Europe, as the economic historian Peter Bernstein notes in his book Against the Gods, it was generally assumed that our fate sat in the lap of deities. And while prayer might influence the future, disasters - such as the Black Death - seemed unfathomably hard to predict.But in the 16th century, European intellectuals such as Gerolamo Cardano and Pierre de Fermat used numbering systems originally formulated by Arab cultures to develop advanced maths - and, most crucially, theories of probability. These were honed in subsequent centuries, and turbocharged after the second world war thanks to computing power, creating the modern risk-management industry. The advent of Big Data has now elevated this even further.""The ability to define what may happen in the future and to choose among alternatives lies at the heart of contemporary societies,"" writes Bernstein, who posits this as the key element dividing modern and premodern societies. ""Risk Continued on page 2 Continued from page 1 management guides us over a vast range of decision-making, from allocating wealth to safeguarding public health, from waging war to planning a family, from paying insurance premiums to wearing a seatbelt, from planting corn to marketing cornflakes.""Today, these probability-based forecasting tools are so ubiquitous - particularly in fields such as finance - that they feel completely ""natural"", if not inevitable, to westerners. Thus we often forget how unusual this approach to risk is in the sweep of human history. We also tend to overlook the fact that our minds have not ""caught up"" with those models in terms of how we evaluate risk. For one thing, humans do not always perceive the passage of time as consistently as a computer. Psychology experiments show that we vastly overemphasise short-term rewards and risks compared with long-term ones (creating a phenomenon that behavioural economists call ""hyperbolic discounting""). Similarly, we attach more weight to risks that appear directly in our line of vision. In a city such as New York, where I live, there is obsessive media coverage of the Covid-19 crisis, which has killed some 65,000 people so far in America. But previously there was little focus on seasonal flu (which killed 34,000 in the US in the 2018-19 season, according to the CDC); nor on traffic accidents, diabetes or smoking, which respectively kill around 36,000, 84,000 and 480,000 each year.""Societies and organisations are defined not so much by what risks they identify and manage, but by what they decide - whether willingly or reluctantly - to ignore,"" says Anette Mikes, a riskmanagement expert at Saïd Business School. ""Human beings are very good at using their senses to detect threats in their immediate environment,"" echoes Hugh Gusterson, an anthropologist who has studied the US nuclear industry. ""Humans are not so good at being aware of more abstract threats, even though they are often far more serious.""Another distorting factor is our social boundaries. We often - and wrongly - define ""danger"" as something outside our social group, and downplay internal threats. When Donald Trump described Covid-19 as the ""Chinese virus"", he was following a well-worn historical path of resorting to xenophobia in a time of disease. Or as Kristin Hedges and Michael Ennis-McMillan, two medical anthropologists, note in a recent paper: ""The human tendency to divide society into 'us' and 'others' when fear strikes becomes especially prevalent during infectious disease epidemics.""Structures of power and trust also matter. Back in 2008, we learnt that while financial models appeared to be based on universal principles of maths, they were created and used in different ways by different ""tribes"" of financiers.Similarly, our sense of risk in an epidemic is shaped by the question of who we think has the responsibility for handling it. Mikes, for example, identifies four overlapping patterns in how different social groups handle risk. Sometimes it is considered the responsibility of individuals to manage risk (under the principle of caveat emptor). On other occasions there is a more egalitarian approach: everyone in a community voluntarily tries to protect everyone else. A third framework uses hierarchical controls: leaders manage risk by issuing orders. Then there is a fourth option: fatalism, when nobody tries to manage risks at all.In peaceful times, we do not often define which of these four approaches we rely on to keep us safe; or not unless we work in jobs explicitly focused on measuring or trading risk, such as finance (where the concept of caveat emptor often collides with hierarchical rules). But Covid-19 crystallises this. Some of us may want to handle the dangers of an epidemic in an individualistic way, like those Lansing protesters. Others, such as the governor of Michigan, Gretchen Whitmer, who imposed the lockdown, think that hierarchical controls are needed. Nearly all of us probably have an egalitarian instinct too: we want to avoid infecting ourselves and each other. But few citizens - let alone politicians - want to stipulate explicitly how anyone should prioritise these approaches. Nor do many want to resort to the fourth option: fatalism.So where does that leave governments and citizens? In a state of confusing flux, it seems, in most countries. Take America. Its founding mythology is built on the principle of individual freedom and an ideal of the individualistic management of risk. Many citizens still embrace that: this week, for example, social media has buzzed with the tale of a hairdresser in Texas who is being sent to prison for keeping her salon open amid the enforced lockdown.But this is a rarity: most individuals recognise that pandemics are a group threat. So, in most states, there has been a sliding towards a form of hierarchical risk management in recent weeks, with lockdowns, travel bans and other controls. Moreover, members of the White House Covid-19 advisory task force have been surprised - and delighted - by the high levels of compliance.What is even more striking is the rise of egalitarian risk management in the US. Consider masks. These have long been used by the populations of many Asian countries, such as Japan and China, to prevent infected people from spreading disease or creating risks for others. That reflects their collectivist traditions (and experience of the Sars epidemic of the early 2000s).Until a couple of weeks ago, masks were almost never used in this way in New York. Now, however, it has become mandatory in crowded spaces. And what is notable is that there is rising social pressure to use masks, even in places where they are not mandatory. ""Dear Jogger, Bicycle douchebag, Yuppie/Millennial, Narcissist Swine,"" declared a sign this week in Brooklyn. ""Put on your fucking mask! Please respect your community and the lives of others. You do not live alone!"" There is also peer pressure to observe social distancing: self-styled citizen activists have used drones to monitor spaces, posting pictures of crowds on Florida beaches with disapproving comments. Stories are circulating on social media about citizens in New York or Florida reporting their neighbours to the police for ""crimes"" such as secretly employing hairdressers at home.Moreover, the US is not the only place where egalitarian risk controls are spreading. In the Czech Republic, the wearing of masks was not previously a feature of everyday life. But, notes Gusterson, ""almost all Czechs now wear face masks amid the coronavirus crisis because of an extraordinary grassroots movement that has incited mass homemanufacture of masks that are left on trees for anyone to take.""The movement, whose slogan is 'my mask protects you; your mask protects me', has, in just a few weeks, made those who do not wear masks appear selfish and antisocial."" Sweden, by contrast, previously had a stronger tradition of egalitarian risk management: even without hierarchical controls or a lockdown, people have been practising voluntary social distancing. So too in Singapore.In Britain the pattern is almost as confused - and conflicted - as in the US.When the crisis first hit in March, the government embraced the fourth model of risk control, namely fatalism, with prime minister Boris Johnson famously declaring that ""many more families are going to lose loved ones"".But then Britain abruptly adopted hierarchical risk controls, and introduced rules that are in most respects tougher than those in New York, say.Some London friends of mine have also embraced tight individualistic risk controls, taking measures that are unseen in New York, such as ""quarantining"" delivery packages before introducing them into the house. However, British citizens have not embraced the idea of using face masks to prevent infected people from spreading disease.This might yet shift again. When a society switches into crisis mode, notes Mikes, it ""tends to bring to the surface irreconcilable conflicts between values that in normal circumstances are invisible"". So too in an exit, if not more so. ""In many ways, lockdown is intellectually easy ... as a remedy it is clear-cut. The exit strategy is much less clear.""In one scenario that might play out in the coming months, a climate of fear creates more desire for hierarchical risk management; governments would be expected to manage health risks to an increasing degree. But it is also possible to imagine a rebellion in a place such as America, whereby the burden of risk is handed back to the individual. Or a sense of fatalism might emerge, if the economic price of pandemic control spirals too high. There are precedents: Americans are wearily used to the idea that 40,000 die each year from guns, and many accept this as the price of freedom.Technology further muddies the issue. In China, tech companies have already developed a phone app that can be used to track whether someone has had Covid-19, or not, with the results displayed like a traffic light. This is used for hierarchical risk-management control: the government will permit travel, say, if the app is green. Some Silicon Valley whizz-kids are seeking to copy this (even though it is unclear whether people who have had Covid-19 have immunity). The British government is producing another twist on this idea: a tracking and tracing app.This might yet reinforce hierarchical controls in the west, as in China. But a ""traffic light"" app could - in theory - also be used to help individuals manage their own risk (by checking on the health of others) or to promote egalitarian protections (by telling individuals when they need to isolate and/or monitoring the health of a group).Apps might also open our eyes to other risks we currently ignore, such as ""normal"" flu. They could redefine our social boundaries. After all, the Covid-19 crisis has already forced us to define who is ""inside"" or ""outside"", be that at a household, communal, ethnic or national level. If we create apps to track the health of these groups, those boundaries will be further entrenched.Where might this lead? My own best guess is that in countries such as the US and UK, we are heading towards a future with more emphasis on egalitarian risk control but within social boundaries; keeping our ""tribe"" safe will be the new mantra. But the key point to note is this: ""The word 'risk' hails from the early Italian risicare, which means 'to dare',"" as Bernstein said. ""In this sense, risk is a choice rather than a fate."" Moreover, how we make that choice defines ""what it means to be human"". Let us hope we can make those choices wisely.Gillian Tett is chair of the FT's US editorial boardMillions will have to make their own judgments: is it safe to go to the shops? See a friend?

The US Attorney's Office said Amnott and his wife were contacted by their friend Hayes, who claimed that three of her children had been kidnapped and were being held by two Mennonite families in Dayton.Hayes allegedly told them she worked in intelligence for the US government and was living in Maryland with her boyfriend Gary Blake Reburn.Prosecutors said the claims she worked for the government and that her kids had been kidnapped were completely false.The prosecution statement said: ""To effectuate the kidnapping, the conspirators planned to kill the parents.""According to the plan, Hayes, Reburn and Frank Amnott would enter the first house and hold the parents at gunpoint.""After the two children were secured by Hayes, Reburn and Amnott would execute the parents.

584,"Coronavirus lockdown: calls grow for release of restless twentysomethings;Those aged 20-30 are in least physical danger but their mental health and finances are suffering most, researchers say","May 9, 2020 Saturday",International,thetimes.co.uk,860,860,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,"Gabriel Pogrund, Shingi Mararike, Shanti Das and Nicholas Hellen","Coronavirus lockdown: calls grow for release of restless twentysomethingsThose aged 20-30 are in least physical danger but their mental health and finances are suffering most, researchers say","In a suburb of Stevenage, Hertfordshire, a young man disguised as a bush can be seen on video, shuffling down the street, using front gardens as camouflage to avoid the police. ""What's our neighbour doing?"" says the narrator. ""Reaching new extremes in how to sneak out!""The clip, which has garnered 3.3 million views on the sharing site TikTok, taps into a welling sentiment among young people: a desire to break the lockdown. They are starting to rebel against restrictions designed to tackle a disease that has left most of them physically unscathed but is damaging their mental wellbeing and life prospects.According to a study by University College London (UCL), they are easily the least compliant age group when it comes to the lockdown: about half of those aged 18-29 admit breaking the rules. The survey of 85,000 found most middle-aged and elderly people complying.This generation gap reflects the reality of the disease: a tiny minority of youngsters who contract the coronavirus die from it. In the first week of May, 10 people in their twenties died of it, compared with 550 in their sixties.Yet the young are faring worse during the lockdown, reporting the strongest feelings of loneliness, anxiety and suicide. UCL found that almost 30% of young people have thought about death recently and that the young had lower life satisfaction than any other age group.Daisy Fancourt, who leads the research, has told Public Health England and the government about the findings: ""We have made them aware of the disproportionate impact that lockdown is having on younger people.""For many adults, the lockdown has been a surprisingly tranquil experience. But for people in their peak social years it has heralded a collective Fomo [""fear of missing out""] and a sense of anxiety and loss about a time they had expected to spend on formative experiences. Added to that is the tyranny that stalks every generation of young people: boredom.As the government announces the next phase of lockdown today, it faces a question: could discontent curdle into mutiny?Andrew Oswald, a behavioural scientist at Warwick University, is among those calling for the state to head off mass non-compliance by introducing a ""staged exit"" from the lockdown in which those in their twenties are released straight away, followed by those in their thirties.""We have to think about the terrible plight of these young people,"" he said. ""[They] should be released almost immediately. It's important to understand they're almost completely safe.""He added that the disproportionate financial effect of Covid-19 on the young made the case for relaxing the rules even more urgent: ""A lot of the old are in a fairly secure position, even if we're all fed up with not being able to go to the beach, but the young . . . have very largely run out of all money and their life prospects have suddenly worsened dramatically.""Young people have the lowest confidence in the government of any group. According to the study, their trust in Boris Johnson has risen under the lockdown, but less than in other age groups.Dylan Welsh, 22, a student at Strathclyde University in Glasgow, has been self-isolating in his flat for eight weeks. He reported seeing people on Instagram flouting the lockdown: ""It infuriates me, but I'm in an awkward position to be, like: are you properly social distancing?""Sonali Gidwani, 23, a technology consultant in London, said she knew one person who had contracted Covid-19 after ""sleeping around"" during the lockdown. ""It's very frustrating,"" she said.Meanwhile, the authorities have clamped down on house parties, barbecues in parks and large gatherings. In Stockton, Co Durham, last week police secured a closure order for a flat that held a lockdown party featuring a ""constant flow of visitors by car, taxi, bicycle, moped and on foot"".On the Wirral, the council has drawn up a list of hotspots where young people are gathering illicitly. Last week it said that its detached youth team - an arm of social services - had been redeployed to round up errant teenagers and ""educate them"" on social distancing.Yesterday people flocked to London's parks and public spaces to enjoy the sunshine, with many flouting social distancing rules. Hackney Marshes was crammed with young people swimming in the River Lea. Police wrote on social media: ""We're fighting a losing battle in the parks today. Hundreds of people sitting having pizza, beers, wines.""Officers were also stopping drivers on the A23 on their way to Brighton yesterday and turning them back.Some councils and youth charities say disadvantaged youngsters are most likely to flout rules, with a lack of adult supervision or entertainment at home. They are also the least likely to have gardens.Sam Rowe, founder of the Academy of Hard Knocks, which aims to cut youth crime in east London through martial arts, said: ""A lot of them haven't got the internet or the gadgets and gizmos that rich kids have . . . They say, 'I don't know what to do. I can't do this, can't do that, can't go out.' They're stuck indoors.""A lot of them are so fed up with the lockdown that they're breaking it. They're bored and frustrated.""",Web Publication
585,Stay alert: Boris Johnson's new message to the nation;Five-tier Covid-19 warning system similar to terror status designed to boost public awareness,"May 9, 2020 Saturday",International,telegraph.co.uk,857,857,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,"By Edward Malnick, Sunday Political Editor",Stay alert: Boris Johnson's new message to the nationFive-tier Covid-19 warning system similar to terror status designed to boost public awareness,"Boris Johnson will ask the country to ""stay alert, control the virus and save lives"", as he unveils a new Covid-19 warning system as part of his road map to gradually unlocking the economy.In anaddress to the nation tomorrow evening, the Prime Minister is to call on workers and businesses to stay alert by following strict social distancing rules, as the Government encourages those who cannot work from home to begin returning to offices and factories.A new five-tier warning system, akin to the scheme used to publicise terror threat levels, will be used to flag up the virus risk and encourage public adherence to the rules.Alerts will range from level one (green) to level five (red). Mr Johnson is expected to say that England is on the verge of moving from four, the second highest level, to three, which would indicate that the infection rate is not increasing significantly.The system will be administered by a Joint Biosecurity Centre, which will be responsible for detecting local spikes of Covid-19 so ministers can increase restrictions where necessary to help reduce the infection rates.Mr Johnson will drop the Government's previous slogan - ""Stay at home, Protect the NHS, Save lives"" - as he attempts to cautiously reopen sections of the economy, in the week after the Bank of England warned the country was on course for its sharpest recession on record.The new slogan - ""Stay alert, Control the virus, Save lives"" - has been drawn up by Isaac Levido, the Australian strategist, and Ben Guerin, a 25-year-old New Zealander who advised the Conservatives on their social media strategy during last year's election.But Grant Shapps, the Transport Secretary, warned last night that the 2-metre social distancing rulemeant that even when the UK transport networks returned to operating at full capacity, only one in 10 passengers would be able to travel, to minimise the risk of transmitting the virus.The Government's full road map is due to be published in a 50-page document tomorrow, when the plan will be outlined to MPs. On Tuesday evening Mr Johnson is expected to address the 1922 Committee of backbench Conservative MPs amid growing alarm within the ranks about the economic impact of the lockdown.He is expected to point to the road map to show the Government is planning a way out of the current restrictions. But a Downing Street source said he would proceed with ""maximum caution and maximum conditionality"". He is also expected to announce plans to lift specific restrictions on outdoor activity, such as the limit on one form of exercise for an hour per day.The Government will also allow garden centres to reopen for this week, but will increase fines for those caught flouting the existing rules.Meanwhile, from next month, passengers arriving at British airports and ports will be placed in quarantine for up to a fortnight, under plans revealed by The Sunday Telegraph last month.The fresh slogan was drawn up by Downing Street after fears that the instruction to ""stay at home"" had proved too effective during the first phase of the Government's response to the pandemic, with many who were allowed to go to work choosing to remain at home. This week ministers will encourage those who cannot work from home to return to premises such as offices and factories, provided they can do so safely.Workers and businesses will be told they can ""stay alert"" by following social distancing rules, including keeping two metres away from anyone from a different household.The Government is also likely to issue advice about face masks to help reduce the spread of infection in public settings. Mr Johnson has saidthe ""R"" value,or rate of transmission, must remain below one, meaning that each infected person passes the virus on to less than one other. The rate is pushed up by the number of social interactions.The new slogan drops the ""protect the NHS"" mantra but a No 10 source said: ""We will take the decisions that continue to save lives and protect the NHS, proceeding with maximum caution and maximum conditionality.""This is a critical moment, so having assessed the evidence carefully and scrutinised the data, the PM will address the public and ask for their resolve as we continue to do whatever is needed to defeat this appalling virus.""Mr Johnson is expected to suggest following social distancing rules will help to save livelihoods as well as lives. Tonight's broadcast will be his second national address of the pandemic, and the first since being hospitalised.Ahead of the 7pm broadcast, he will lead a meeting of the Cobra emergency committee, attended by leaders of the devolved administrations, and Sadiq Khan, the Mayor of London.A No 10 source said the new biosecurity alert system would allow the Government to ""determine how tough we need to be in our social distancing measures.""Meanwhile, Susan Michie, a member of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies' behavioural sub-committee, said the Government needed to launch a new advertising campaign to remind people of the need of the need to continue with hygiene measures, such as washing their hands for 20 seconds, as they return to work.",Newspaper; Web Publication

You have not been given sufficient information on how to get your employees safely to work, nor how to keep them safe while they are there. We hope that the statement in parliament and the promised guidance documents will enable business to prepare. At the moment, it would be foolish for any business leader to encourage staff not already undertaking essential work to do anything but to continue to work from home tomorrow if they can do so.block-time published-time 9.24pm BST  Johnson's speech: environmental analysis  Boris Johnson has promised to ""shine the light of science"" to help the UK emerge from the coronavirus gloom, but there were disappointingly few indications in Sunday's speech that he plans to direct that same beam of knowledge towards a clean, green recovery of the nation's economic health.The address to the nation was cautious and tentative. Instead of a road map, Johnson gave the nation a ""sketch of a roadmap"". Instead of a way ahead, he provided only a ""sense of a way ahead"". Instead of strong government leadership, the onus was on individuals to do the right thing and experts to provide the necessary data and technology.The UK will be changed by this experience, the prime minister told us, but he provided no vision of the future, merely a list of comparative adjectives - stronger, better, more resilient, more innovative, more economically dynamic, more generous, more sharing.Many of these ambitions could imply action on the longer-term problems facing the country and the world, such as the climate crisis. Or they could mean nothing at all. There were no details of anything new and positive that could emerge from the colossal suffering of the pandemic as the NHS and United Nations emerged from the ruins of the second world war. There was no mention either of a green new deal, which other nations plan to use as a vehicle for economic recovery. Nor were there details of how air quality improvements could be maintained, though many city mayors in the UK are already working on this.Johnson encouraged more cycling, walking and a continuation of working from home, but when that was not possible, he urged people to drive rather than to use public transport. This is sensible given the need for physical distancing on trains and buses, but it added to the overall impression of a prime minister reacting to necessity rather than getting ahead of problems, pre-empting risks and forging a path illuminated by the ""light of science"".There should be more details about the future direction of the economy in the coming days, when Johnson addresses parliament, or when the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, unveils stimulus plans. If the prime minister is serious about the nation returning to ""robust health"", the science is clear that climate, nature and air quality must be part of the recovery.block-time updated-timeUpdated at 9.28pm BSTblock-time published-time 9.17pm BST  PM's message telling workers to return to factories is 'recipe for chaos', says TUC   Frances O'Grady, the TUC general secretary, has described Boris Johnson's speech as ""a recipe for chaos"" because safety measures for a return to work are not in place.enltrLots of working people will feel confused and anxious after listening to Boris Johnson.

He is still using the ""stay at home"" message, and he is not encouraging Londoners to go to work in the way that Johnson tentatively was.In a statement, Khan said:I want to be as clear as possible with Londoners - social distancing measures are still in place. Lockdown hasn't been lifted and we all still need to play our part in stopping the spread of Covid-19. You must still stay at home as much as possible and keep a safe two-metre distance from other people at all times when you are out. Everyone must continue to work from home if they possibly can. You must not use public transport for any unnecessary journeys. If you really have to travel, please avoid rush hour. Please walk or cycle whenever possible. We still have a long way to go to defeat this virus and we have not returned to life as it was before...I urge the government to continue to work with employers, employees and trades unions to design a proper plan for how we can keep everyone safe as they return to work.

You cannot stay alert to something you can't see.The UK government has cut itself adrift of the three-nation approach which now exists between Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. There is no clearer and simpler message than 'stay at home'.block-time updated-timeUpdated at 9.23pm BSTblock-time published-time 8.59pm BST The Police Federation of England and Wales  has said that police officers have been put under extreme pressure because of the mixed messages coming out about the lockdown. In a statement on the  PM's speech, John Apter, the federation's national chair, said:The government has, as expected, made a decision to relax its lockdown guidance in England. This comes following a week of mixed messages and the release of some information which, fuelled by media speculation, meant many people acted as though the lockdown had already ended. This is putting extreme pressure on my colleagues who are on the frontline trying to enforce legislation in these most challenging of times.What we need from the prime minister and the government now is clear and unambiguous messaging and guidance, explaining what exactly is expected of the public, so that my colleagues can do their level best to police it.Police officers will continue to do their best, but their work must be based on crystal clear guidance, not loose rules that are left open to interpretation - because that will be grossly unfair on officers whose job is already challenging. If the message of what is expected of the public is not clear then it will make the job of policing this legislation almost impossible.block-time updated-timeUpdated at 9.22pm BSTblock-time published-time 8.52pm BST  Boris Johnson's speech - A five-point analysis   Boris Johnson seems to like the idea of making a Gaullist address to the nation on evening TV. This was the second time he's done it during this crisis. But tonight's event had an unhappy prequel, with No 10 having to damp down expectations created by newspaper headlines suggesting he would be promising lockdown ""freedom"", and he was further constrained tonight by the fact that much of the detail of what he is planning won't come until he presents his document to parliament tomorrow.Still, it was a major speech. Here is a five-point analysis.•Johnson offered a highly-conditional timetable for moving out of the most stringent aspects of lockdown while also stressing that most current restrictions need to remain in place. In terms of announcements that were genuinely new (in the sense that they had not been widely pre-briefed), what was most significant was what he said about what might happen in June and July. He said:In step two - at the earliest by June 1 - after half term - we believe we may be in a position to begin the phased reopening of shops and to get primary pupils back into schools, in stages, beginning with reception, Year 1 and Year 6.Our ambition is that secondary pupils facing exams next year will get at least some time with their teachers before the holidays. And we will shortly be setting out detailed guidance on how to make it work in schools and shops and on transport.And step three - at the earliest by July - and subject to all these conditions and further scientific advice; if and only if the numbers support it, we will hope to re-open at least some of the hospitality industry and other public places, provided they are safe and enforce social distancing.But Johnson also stressed that these dates were ""dependent on a series of big ifs"" and, compared to other lockdown plans, this timetable was remarkably cursory. The Irish government, for example, has published a ""roadmap for reopening society and business"" that proposes a five-phase easing of restrictions, with specific measures planned of five specific dates going up to 10 August. According to            a report in the Times last week (paywall), Johnson was under pressure from ""datists"" in cabinet to give dates for when certain measures would be relaxed. On the basis of this speech, the ""datists"" secured only to the bare minimum.•Johnson has actually toughened the lockdown much more than he has eased it. The most significant change to the status quo came when he confirmed reports that people arriving in the UK by air will be subject to quarantine. (See 7.14pm.) That is a remarkable shift, particularly for someone who gave a speech earlier this year saying he wanted to resist pressure for barriers to go up. (See 6.30pm.) Johnson also said that he would increase the fines for the small number of people who break social distancing rules. (See 7.11pm.) This will be an England-only measure, and it appears to go against the advice of the government's Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies. As was revealed this afternoon (see 4.56pm), in response to a proposal in April for greater penalties on lockdown offenders, Sage said:Any flat rate financial penalty will have a higher impact on poorer households.•The ""careful"" steps to ease the lockdown this week announced as new measures in practice amounted to little more than saying that sunbathing is allowed, in England. Johnson said two things would be happening this week. First, people would be encouraged to go to work if they cannot work from home. He said:We said that you should work from home if you can, and only go to work if you must. We now need to stress that anyone who can't work from home, for instance those in construction or manufacturing, should be actively encouraged to go to work.But for most of the last seven weeks the government's line has been that people should go to work if they can't work from home. When the government first announced the lockdown it put out guidance saying ""all non-essential premises must now close"", but this line was swiftly removed from the document because it was not the message the government wanted to give out. And ministers infuriated Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London, by refusing to back his call for all construction work to halt.Second, Johnson said that from Wednesday people would be able to take more exercise. Referring to England, he said:And from this Wednesday, we want to encourage people to take more and even unlimited amounts of outdoor exercise.You can sit in the sun in your local park, you can drive to other destinations, you can even play sports but only with members of your own household.But, unlike in Scotland and Wales, in England the lockdown restrictions never said that people could only go out once a day for exercise (even though ministers sometimes said people should exercise just once a day). And official police guidance (pdf) said people could drive to another destination to exercise. All that really seems to be new is that people can sunbath (not something that previously seemed to count as a ""reasonable excuse"" to be out under the regulations).•Johnson announce a new five-step covid alert system that will be used to help decide when lockdown measures can be lifted. (See 7.07pm.) This seems very similar to an approach announced by Cyril Ramaphosa, the South African president, in a speech last month. Here is the South African system.    South Africa's coronavirus alert system - similar to the one announced by Boris Johnson tonight Photograph: South African government   But Johnson did not explain which lockdown measures will apply for which alert level. (Perhaps there will be more detail in the document being published tomorrow.) He also said changes to the alert level will be triggered primarily by changes to R, the reproduction number (which shows the coronavirus infectivity rate). But all he could say about R was that it was between 0.5 and 0.9. In Germany the Robert Koch Institute publishes a daily bulletin (like            this one - pdf) which gives R to the nearest two decimal points.•Johnson claimed that he was speaking as prime minister of the United Kingdom (see 7.04pm) - although the row about the new No 10 ""stay alert"" slogan showed that in important respects he is acting as just prime minister of England. There is no formal position of English PM in the UK constitution, but devolution has made it an implicit component of the prime minister's job and, with Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland refusing to follow Johnson in his coronavirus messaging today, he was left sounding more England-only than normal.

In it he stresses that he has already published a roadmap for Wales, and that Wales will not be reopening schools on 1 June. He says:The prime minister also set out his roadmap for the future. This is at an early stage because it depends on how the virus behaves over the coming weeks and months.Two weeks ago, I published a framework to lead Wales out of the pandemic. This has helped us decide that schools will not return to normal on 1 June.We will continue to make decisions which are right for Wales, using information and expert advice about how coronavirus is circulating here to keep us safe.block-time updated-timeUpdated at 9.04pm BSTblock-time published-time 8.20pm BST The view of Boris Johnson's speech from senior police sources was that key parts of their role in enforcing the lockdown were in effect over.""Impossible,"" said one senior source, referring to the prospect of enforcing the lockdown other than policing larger groups of people out of their homes. The dropping of the ""stay at home"" message, it is feared, will cause confusion, making the restrictions ""unpoliceable"".New guidance was hurriedly being drawn up for officers around the country about the new rules, and what they should and should not police.One source with close knowledge of the police's efforts enforcing coronavirus rules, when asked how easy the new rules would be to enforce, said: ""Not a chance in hell.""block-time updated-timeUpdated at 8.47pm BSTblock-time published-time 8.10pm BST In an interview with Sky News Ian Blackford, the SNP's leader at Westminster, went even further than Nicola Sturgeon in criticising the PM's speech.

""Pretty much everything he said in that statement applied to England,"" she said. There were no current plans in Scotland to reopen primary schools or building sites, or to suggest people start playing sports, she said. She went on:He is the prime minister of the UK. I'm not trying to gainsay that, but these restrictions are in place legally separately in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland and therefore we have a duty to take decision in our own jurisdictions about the speed with which we lift those.[It] is incumbent on him, maybe a bit more strongly than he did tonight, to stress that when he's talking about lifting these restrictions, he's talking for England. We really have such a duty just now to be as clear as possible.block-time updated-timeUpdated at 8.32pm BSTblock-time published-time 7.44pm BST  France to be exempt from UK quarantine rules, Johnson and Macron agree  Downing Street has just released a joint statement from the British and French governments, after a call between Boris Johnson and the French president, Emmanuel Macron.It says the French will be exempt from the UK's proposed quarantine restrictions. (See 7.14pm.)The joint statement says Johnson and Macron spoke today. It goes on:They stressed the need for close bilateral, European and international cooperation in the fight against Covid-19.The leaders spoke about the need to manage the risk of new transmissions arising from abroad, as the rate of coronavirus decreases domestically.In this regard, the prime minister and the president agreed to work together in taking forward appropriate border measures. This cooperation is particularly necessary for the management of our common border. No quarantine measures would apply to travellers coming from France at this stage; any measures on either side would be taken in a concerted and reciprocal manner. A working group between the two governments will be set up to ensure this consultation throughout the coming weeks.block-time updated-timeUpdated at 8.32pm BSTblock-time published-time 7.37pm BST  Starmer says people should not have to go back to work without 'clear plan for safety'   Sir Keir Starmer, the Labour leader, has issued this response to the prime minister's speech.This statement raises more questions than it answers, and we see the prospect of England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland pulling in different directions.The prime minister appears to be effectively telling millions of people to go back to work without a clear plan for safety or clear guidance as to how to get there without using public transport.What the country wanted tonight was clarity and consensus, but we haven't got either of those.block-time published-time 7.34pm BST The full text of Boris Johnson's speech is here, on the No 10 website.block-time published-time 7.18pm BST Here is my colleague Rowena Mason 's news story about the speech.

The next phase could be more dangerous, he says.We have been through the initial peak - but it is coming down the mountain that is often more dangerous.We have a route, and we have a plan, and everyone in government has the all-consuming pressure and challenge to save lives, restore livelihoods and gradually restore the freedoms that we need.But in the end this is a plan that everyone must make work.And when I look at what you have done already.The patience and common sense you have shown.The fortitude of the elderly whose isolation we all want to end as fast as we can.The incredible bravery and hard work of our NHS staff, our care workers.The devotion and self-sacrifice of all those in every walk of life who are helping us to beat this disease.Police, bus drivers, train drivers, pharmacists, supermarket workers, road hauliers, bin collectors, cleaners, security guards, postal workers, our teachers and a thousand more.The scientists who are working round the clock to find a vaccine.When I think of the millions of everyday acts of kindness and thoughtfulness that are being performed across this country. And that have helped to get us through this first phase.I know that we can use this plan to get us through the next.And if we can't do it by those dates, and if the alert level won't allow it, we will simply wait and go on until we have got it right.We will come back from this devilish illness.We will come back to health, and robust health.And though the UK will be changed by this experience, I believe we can be stronger and better than ever before.More resilient, more innovative, more economically dynamic, but also more generous and more sharing.But for now we must stay alert, control the virus and save lives.Thank you very much.block-time updated-timeUpdated at 7.20pm BSTblock-time published-time 7.14pm BST  Johnson confirms quarantine will be introduced for new arrivals to UK  Johnson confirms quarantine will be introduced for new arrivals.And to prevent reinfection from abroad, I am serving notice that it will soon be the time - with transmission significantly lower - to impose quarantine on people coming into this country by air.And it is because of your efforts to get the R down and the number of infections down here, that this measure will now be effective.And of course we will be monitoring our progress locally, regionally, and nationally and if there are outbreaks, if there are problems, we will not hesitate to put on the brakes.block-time updated-timeUpdated at 7.20pm BSTblock-time published-time 7.13pm BST  Johnson says from June some pupils in England could return to school  Johnson goes on to explain what might happen in June and July.In step two - at the earliest by June 1 - after half term - we believe we may be in a position to begin the phased reopening of shops and to get primary pupils back into schools, in stages, beginning with reception, Year 1 and Year 6.Our ambition is that secondary pupils facing exams next year will get at least some time with their teachers before the holidays. And we will shortly be setting out detailed guidance on how to make it work in schools and shops and on transport.And step three - at the earliest by July - and subject to all these conditions and further scientific advice; if and only if the numbers support it, we will hope to re-open at least some of the hospitality industry and other public places, provided they are safe and enforce social distancing.Throughout this period of the next two months we will be driven not by mere hope or economic necessity.We are going to be driven by the science, the data and public health.And I must stress again that all of this is conditional, it all depends on a series of big Ifs.It depends on all of us - the entire country - to follow the advice, to observe social distancing, and to keep that R down.block-time updated-timeUpdated at 7.56pm BSTblock-time published-time 7.11pm BST  Johnson gives details of 'first, careful steps' to ease lockdown  Johnson announces the ""first, careful steps"" to ease the lockdown.Instead we are taking the first careful steps to modify our measures.And the first step is a change of emphasis that we hope that people will act on this week.We said that you should work from home if you can, and only go to work if you must.We now need to stress that anyone who can't work from home, for instance those in construction or manufacturing, should be actively encouraged to go to work.And we want it to be safe for you to get to work. So you should avoid public transport if at all possible - because we must and will maintain social distancing, and capacity will therefore be limited.So work from home if you can, but you should go to work if you can't work from home.And to ensure you are safe at work we have been working to establish new guidance for employers to make workplaces COVID-secure.And when you do go to work, if possible do so by car or even better by walking or bicycle. But just as with workplaces, public transport operators will also be following COVID-secure standards.And from this Wednesday, we want to encourage people to take more and even unlimited amounts of outdoor exercise.You can sit in the sun in your local park, you can drive to other destinations, you can even play sports but only with members of your own household.You must obey the rules on social distancing and to enforce those rules we will increase the fines for the small minority who break them.And so every day, with ever increasing data, we will be monitoring the R and the number of new infections, and the progress we are making, and if we as a nation begin to fulfil the conditions I have set out, then in the next few weeks and months we may be able to go further.block-time published-time 7.09pm BST  Lockdown can't end this week, says Johnson  Johnson says the lockdown can't end this week.And yet when I look at where we are tonight, we have the R below 1, between 0.5 and 0.9 - but potentially only just below 1.And though we have made progress in satisfying at least some of the conditions I have given, we have by no means fulfilled all of them.And so no, this is not the time simply to end the lockdown this week.block-time updated-timeUpdated at 7.11pm BSTblock-time published-time 7.08pm BST Johnson explains how local flare-ups will be tackled.So that - all told - we are testing literally hundreds of thousands of people every day.We have made fast progress on testing - but there is so much more to do now, and we can.When this began, we hadn't seen this disease before, and we didn't fully understand its effects.With every day we are getting more and more data.

587,"Now is not the time for mixed messages - nor for Boris Johnson striking out on his own;Editorial: If the government wants to use a new Covid-19 slogan, politicians - and more importantly the public - need to understand what the alteration means and why it has happened","May 10, 2020 Sunday",International,The Independent (United Kingdom),799,799,England & Wales,Editorial,"Now is not the time for mixed messages - nor for Boris Johnson striking out on his ownEditorial: If the government wants to use a new Covid-19 slogan, politicians - and more importantly the public - need to understand what the alteration means and why it has happened","From the moment the government's new coronavirus slogan first emerged, there was criticism.Then, on Sunday lunchtime, in a somewhat more serious intervention, it was aggressively disowned by Scotland's first minister Nicola Sturgeon. Arlene Foster, her Northern Ireland counterpart, also said officials from the region would not be deviating from the original message. While Wales's health minister, Vaughan Gething, tweeted there had not been a ""four-nations agreement"" about any change.So just for England then, ""stay home"" has been replaced with ""stay alert"". The second message is no longer ""protect the NHS"" but ""control the virus"". Part three is still ""save lives"".The disagreement - with the stay-at-home regulations being controlled by each devolved government - is a highly undesirable state of affairs for life in this country.Coronavirus has done precious little to depolarise the UK. There are millions, tens of millions even, who loathe Boris Johnson, and who will pass up no opportunity to take the most damning reading of anything the government does.But even the most generous judges would conclude that the new messaging is poor. What does ""stay alert"" mean? Nicola Sturgeon was asked this very question, to which her reply was, ""I don't know.""Tory MPs have been busily explaining how obvious it is what the new slogan means. It means, apparently, follow the rules. The communities and local government secretary, Robert Jenrick, has said that it means ""stay at home as much as possible"". We have subsequently been given explanatory notes as to exactly what ""stay alert"" means.But if you have to explain what a slogan means, then clearly the slogan hasn't worked. There is a reason top advertising agencies are paid huge sums of money, often to produce little more than half a sentence.Leaving someone with no doubt as to what's required of them, while taking up no more than two or three seconds of their attention, is a difficult business - and the government has got it rather badly wrong.As for ""control the virus"" - the entire point is that the virus is invisible. Many people have likely already had it pass through them, asymptomatically. Others have it within them currently, but will not know for some time.In a sense, the last days have vindicated what might have been wrongly perceived as mistakes by the government several weeks ago. It does appear that the concerns of the so-called nudge unit might not have been without merit. That lockdown had to be timed right, so that people would not tire of it at the wrong moment.And people do seem to be tiring of the lockdown, and are taking more risks with their own behaviour. But that is why it is not a time for increased ambiguity about what behaviour might be possible.Nicola Sturgeon is regularly praised as a highly able and effective politician, which she is. But not all aspects of being a politician are entirely noble. When she said on Sunday that it was not sustainable for the leaders of the two governments to read of each other's plans ""in the pages of the newspapers"", she did not mention that, on previous occasions, she has taken it upon herself to announce UK-wide government policy hours before the prime minister has had the chance.Coronavirus: Sturgeon removes once-a-day-limit on exercise from lockdown measures, as she warns 'mixed messages' could cost livesA politician's primary duty is to keep their people safe, and if there is an opportunity to claim to be doing this while taking a swing at your opponents, an effective politician will certainly take it, as Ms Sturgeon has done.Ultimately, the most significant news that has emerged in the last few days are the views of two scientists. The first was Sweden's Anders Tegnell, who has defended the no-lockdown policy in his country, for which he bears responsibility, claiming that lockdowns will achieve very little. That, in the end, they will have to be eased, and all countries, regardless of policy, will come to have very similar fatality rates.The second was from the virologist Peter Piot, director of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, who advises the European Commission on coronavirus and almost died from it himself. ""Let's be clear,"" he wrote. ""Without a coronavirus vaccine, we will never be able to live normally again ... and it is still not even certain that developing a Covid-19 vaccine is possible.""Ultimately, no one has a roadmap out of this crisis, and the tweaking of government slogans is scarcely even worthy of a signpost along the way.Until this point, however, people did at least appear to have some understanding of what they should and shouldn't be doing, even if some chose to ignore it.At the moment, all that is certain is uncertainty. It is hardly the time to introduce even more ambiguity.",Newspaper; Web Publication

Not that I'm advocating it, you understand but we all have our tipping point.WFor Catherine Calderwood, the former chief medical officer for Scotland, it was family trips to her holiday cottage. For Professor Neil Ferguson, the government advisor, it was trysts with his lover Antonia Staats - his vital Staats, so to speak.I'm ashamed to say that for me it would be a session with my hairdresser. When Boris's baby arrived with a full head of quarantine hair, it was a clear sign from the gods that the nation's hairdressers needed to get back to work.As the late Margo MacDonald knew, you should never underestimate the restorative power of a good cut and colour. That hairdressers may feel differently about the risks needed to service the vanity of others is entirely understandable.Everyone's thoughts are turning to loosening lockdown. The Scottish government has started a consultation exercise with the public to see what they would like lifted first. The answer appears to be golf.But what is striking is that for every person desperate to hug a grandchild, there are plenty who do not want to see lockdown lifted until a proven treatment or vaccine is developed. The big lesson from this pandemic is how quickly and easily people have adapted to the restrictions placed on their lives.Faced with the message that a previously unknown, untreatable and, for some, deadly virus is sweeping the globe and that the safest place to be is isolated indoors, it is hardly surprising that people are reluctant to play lockdown roulette.Loss-aversion theory comes into play here, too. First advanced by the psychologists Amos Tversky and Nobel laureate Daniel Kahneman, in 1979, it proposes that losing something affects us more strongly than gaining something of equal value. Losing £100 will make you feel up to twice as bad as winning £100 makes you feel good because we weigh negative events more than positive ones. Innately, we gravitate towards minimising our losses rather than maximising our gains.But as more information comes to light about the virus, a growing cohort is questioning the severity of lockdown, the factors that make a difference to the progress and intensity of Covid-19, and the reliability of the model on which government advice has been based.Consensus among sceptics is as prevalent as hen's dentures, however. Without total transparency around the scientific advice, the original code used in the modelling, and trends in the spread and severity of the disease, it is difficult to see how agreement can be reached.This is a dangerous time in the pandemic, not because of academic dissent or any splintering of resolve on our part, but because the fragile détente among politicians is fracturing.The SNP government's roadmap to power is predicated on a sense of Scottish exceptionalism and in some instances they have been right. Our geography and demography mean that in certain situations Scottish problems need, if not Scottish solutions, then different solutions. But these are few and far between. The response to the coronavirus outbreak is certainly not one of them.Nicola Sturgeon has (politically) outlived two prime ministers. There is nothing clubbable about her and she has perfected the throughgritted-teeth approach to cooperation with Westminster. Boris has gone out of his way to be rude and antagonistic about her in the past.There has been a degree of depressing but predictable petty one-upmanship over the past few weeks, which most of us have been prepared to overlook because running a government at present is nobody's idea of a picnic.But throughout history, collaborative solutions to mutual problems have been the bedrock of progress. If ever there were a time for the wisdom of crowds, it is now.A fundamentally different approach to loosening lockdown in Scotland and England would be disastrous, not just because of the confusion and resentment it would cause. Or because of the additional difficulties businesses that operate across the border would face. But because it would squander the one positive in this crisis - a sense of unity and togetherness.Ultimately, we all face different risks and we all have different approaches to risk.Individuals must be allowed to make their own assessment of the risk to themselves and their loved ones within the official parameters.But in a pandemic that has been characterised by speculation based on poor, confusing and incomplete data, the public has been united in its approach. Communities have come together to support vulnerable members without any need of government direction or organisation. Businesses have supported each other. Networks have sprung up.The hallmark of this pandemic has been cooperation, collectivism, accessibility and positivity. There will be a time for inquiry and examination, but it is not now. We went into this as one and we should come out of it together. If the national consensus is breached for reasons of political point scoring, both leaders will find it harder to manage in the long run.You cannot put a kilt on coronavirus. Nobody governs in isolation in a pandemic. Getting into bed with the prime minister may well be the first minister's personal tipping point. But the inconvenient truth is that Nicola needs Boris and Boris needs Nicola.@GillianBowditchIf ever there were a time for the wisdom of crowds, it is now",Newspaper

""We need to get the economy moving. Health is the main priority - but we've found a way to work safely.""The car industry is just one of many retail sectors now wrestling with a crucial question: they might be ready to reopen, but how do they flip consumers' psychological switches and persuade them to open their wallets again? The lockdown and social distancing have brought household spending - which makes up 60% of economic output - to a juddering halt. As shops, cinemas, car dealerships, pubs and restaurants pulled down the shutters, so too did consumers. Data from Visa shows household spending is down by about 30%. The housing market is on hold, with listings and sales down more than 80%, according to Zoopla. Car sales crashed 97% last month, according to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders. Savings are rising as households squirrel away cash.Last week, the Bank of England laid bare the devastation this will wreak on the economy. The UK is braced for the worst recession in 300 years, it warned, with output crashing as much as 30% in the first half of the year and two million people set to lose their jobs. Even when the lockdown is eased, a ""degree of precautionary behaviour by households and businesses is assumed to persist"", it said.Coaxing consumers out of hibernation is one of the most vexing issues facing the economy. It will help define what shape the recovery takes: whether there is a sudden, sharp bounceback in the second half of the year, creating a V-shaped graph, or whether a self-perpetuating cycle of grim economic news results in a slow, attritional U-shaped trudge out.The starting point is bleak. The government's ""Stay at home, protect the NHS, save lives"" slogan helped prevent hospitals from becoming overwhelmed, but in the weeks of lockdown it has also sown a deep-rooted fear of normal activities.Shaking hands is an inconceivable faux pas. Shoppers instinctively give each other a wide berth in the aisles at Tesco. Footage of crowded pubs and trains from before lockdown looks alien. Persuading people that going out can be safe will require significant mental rewiring.""People adjust very quickly to new ways of life,"" said George Buckley, chief UK economist at Nomura. ""It's going to be very difficult to get people back into parts of the economy where social distancing needs to be actively used.""There will be a worry factor about going into pubs and using public transport. If you don't need to do it, why would you do it? It's going to take a long time for people to go back into restaurants and theatres - not from the supply side but from the demand side.""A recent survey by Ipsos Mori showed that more than 60% of people would be uncomfortable returning to bars and restaurants, using public transport or going to a large event. ""People [in the West] tend to overreact and overestimate the fatality and infection rates,"" said Michele Belot, a behavioural economist at the European University Institute in Italy. Its research shows Britons believe that 23% of people in their local area are, or have been, infected with Covid-19, versus 14% in South Korea. The actual rate in both countries is thought to be much lower.Professor David Spiegelhalter, a statistician at Cambridge University, told the BBC last week: ""We do need to have some sort of campaign to encourage people who are very low-risk to get out and start living again, when we are able to.""But living - and spending - will look very different. At car dealerships, customers who brave the trip will sit at least two metres away from the salesperson, possibly separated by a sheet of Perspex and wearing facemasks. Andy Barratt, managing director of Ford in Britain, said it would make any car sale ""a sanitised, mechanical process"".He added: ""You've got to work out how to get the emotion, and that may be selling the sizzle through video. You want to build rapport, trust and loyalty.""Test drives will be either done alone, guided by an app, or with the salesperson sitting in the back-left seat. Peugeot and Vauxhall dealerships will insist on a three-hour gap between test drives of each car to allow for deep cleaning.Forms will be signed electronically.Customers who do not want to enter a branch will be given virtual tours of vehicles, and cars will be delivered to their homes. ""Radical progression comes in the face of adversity,"" said Barratt. ""The dealers have digitised much more quickly. The market has to come back.""A similar story of sanitised selling is taking shape in sectors from fashion to hotels. The coronavirus has left the world awash with unsold clothes. Retailers will have to shift stockpiled spring/summerwear as quickly as possible - but with so many brands on sale, discounting will lose its power, while social distancing will result in a struggle to handle surges in demand at stores or warehouses around the time of Black Friday and Christmas.InterContinental Hotels Group, owner of Holiday Inn, plans to put cleaning kits in rooms, install screens at check-in desks and visibly sanitise communal areas.""We are going to highlight what we do and make sure there are visible cues throughout the hotel,"" said chief executive Keith Barr. ""We're going to look at the customer journey, including the future of buffets. Will they still exist?"" All that extra friction will increase the likelihood that consumers are put off buying things they do not need. That will be a big problem for all retailers of ""discretionary"" - non-urgent - goods. ""You need to re-convince people of the importance of things they've forgotten about,"" said Roger Parry, chairman of polling company YouGov. ""That third flavour of yoghurt they haven't bought in a while: it's reminding people they get pleasure from unnecessary things.""But hopes of a recovery in spending are set against a troubling backdrop. A rising tide of job losses, such as 18,000 announced at Virgin Atlantic, British Airways and Ryanair in the past fortnight, coupled with stagnant wages, is likely to further depress sentiment. Hours will be cut. Google Trends data shows searches for ""redundancy"" and ""mortgage holiday"" have spiked in recent weeks.Those who have not been furloughed or lost their jobs have become forced or willing savers. Simon French at Panmure Gordon said that during times of unemployment, precautionary savings rise. He calculates there are more than 55.5 million consumers in the UK. Of those, seven million have ""cyclical"" jobs in industries such as manufacturing, whose fortunes rise and fall with the wider economy - and are particularly sensitive to economic sentiment. ""They are the bellwether that will determine whether this is a V-shaped recovery in terms of consumer spending or much more of a U-shaped recovery,"" said French.Swathes of households face financial difficulty, especially as mortgage holidays, the furlough scheme and other payment breaks come to an end next month. Capital Economics estimates that two million mortgage holidays have been granted, while claims for universal credit have rocketed. Debt charity StepChange warned that the self-employed and sole traders, who last struggled during the financial crisis, were also at risk of being dragged into difficulty.All that will heap pressure on ministers and the Bank to do more to stimulate the economy via measures such as VAT cuts, a stamp duty holiday and quantitative easing. Car firms want a scrappage scheme and state-funded discounts to get consumers to buy new, low-emission models. Former Tesco boss Sir Terry Leahy called for regulations to be slashed to free up business investment. ""Take housing,"" Leahy said. ""If you were able to build 300,000 homes rather than 100,000, that greatly increases the supply, houses become more affordable, and those house moves make a big difference in terms of consumer spending.""If there is to be a recovery, it must be supported by clear and reassuring messages about safety from the government, said Belot. Countries such as China and South Korea have been able to lift their lockdowns in part because previous epidemics, such as Sars, meant that they already had systems to handle the crisis.""Everything has to do with reassuring people there are public safety measures in place,"" said Belot. ""What is troubling for people is that they do not really see how the year ahead will go. Uncertainty is very bad for consumption and investment. Some countries are more successful than others when it comes to reassurance about a long-term plan. When I talk to people in Asia, they are a lot less worried, because there are protocols in place to respond to possible new outbreaks.""Here, I am not really sure that people are reassured about the way the crisis has been handled.""",Newspaper

Health is the main priority - but we've found a way to work safely.""The car industry is just one of many retail sectors now wrestling with a crucial question: they might be ready to reopen, but how do they flip consumers' psychological switches and persuade them to open their wallets again? The lockdown and social distancing have brought household spending - which makes up 60% of economic output - to a juddering halt. As shops, cinemas, car dealerships, pubs and restaurants pulled down the shutters, so too did consumers. Data from Visa shows household spending is down by about 30%. The housing market is on hold, with listings and sales down more than 80%, according to Zoopla. Car sales crashed 97% last month, according to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders. Savings are rising as households squirrel away cash.Last week, the Bank of England laid bare the devastation this will wreak on the economy. The UK is braced for the worst recession in 300 years, it warned, with output crashing as much as 30% in the first half of the year and two million people set to lose their jobs. Even when the lockdown is eased, a ""degree of precautionary behaviour by households and businesses is assumed to persist"", it said.Coaxing consumers out of hibernation is one of the most vexing issues facing the economy. It will help define what shape the recovery takes: whether there is a sudden, sharp bounceback in the second half of the year, creating a V-shaped graph, or whether a self-perpetuating cycle of grim economic news results in a slow, attritional U-shaped trudge out.The starting point is bleak. The government's ""Stay at home, protect the NHS, save lives"" slogan helped prevent hospitals from becoming overwhelmed, but in the weeks of lockdown it has also sown a deep-rooted fear of normal activities.Shaking hands is an inconceivable faux pas. Shoppers instinctively give each other a wide berth in the aisles at Tesco. Footage of crowded pubs and trains from before lockdown looks alien. Persuading people that going out can be safe will require significant mental rewiring.""People adjust very quickly to new ways of life,"" said George Buckley, chief UK economist at Nomura. ""It's going to be very difficult to get people back into parts of the economy where social distancing needs to be actively used.""There will be a worry factor about going into pubs and using public transport. If you don't need to do it, why would you do it? It's going to take a long time for people to go back into restaurants and theatres - not from the supply side but from the demand side.""A recent survey by Ipsos Mori showed that more than 60% of people would be uncomfortable returning to bars and restaurants, using public transport or going to a large event. ""People [in the West] tend to overreact and overestimate the fatality and infection rates,"" said Michele Belot, a behavioural economist at the European University Institute in Italy. Its research shows Britons believe that 23% of people in their local area are, or have been, infected with Covid-19, versus 14% in South Korea. The actual rate in both countries is thought to be much lower.Professor David Spiegelhalter, a statistician at Cambridge University, told the BBC last week: ""We do need to have some sort of campaign to encourage people who are very low-risk to get out and start living again, when we are able to.""But living - and spending - will look very different. At car dealerships, customers who brave the trip will sit at least two metres away from the salesperson, possibly separated by a sheet of Perspex and wearing facemasks. Andy Barratt, managing director of Ford in Britain, said it would make any car sale ""a sanitised, mechanical process"".He added: ""You've got to work out how to get the emotion, and that may be selling the sizzle through video. You want to build rapport, trust and loyalty.""Test drives will be either done alone, guided by an app, or with the salesperson sitting in the back-left seat. Peugeot and Vauxhall dealerships will insist on a three-hour gap between test drives of each car to allow for deep cleaning.Forms will be signed electronically.Customers who do not want to enter a branch will be given virtual tours of vehicles, and cars will be delivered to their homes. ""Radical progression comes in the face of adversity,"" said Barratt. ""The dealers have digitised much more quickly. The market has to come back.""A similar story of sanitised selling is taking shape in sectors from fashion to hotels. The coronavirus has left the world awash with unsold clothes. Retailers will have to shift stockpiled spring/summerwear as quickly as possible - but with so many brands on sale, discounting will lose its power, while social distancing will result in a struggle to handle surges in demand at stores or warehouses around the time of Black Friday and Christmas.InterContinental Hotels Group, owner of Holiday Inn, plans to put cleaning kits in rooms, install screens at check-in desks and visibly sanitise communal areas.""We are going to highlight what we do and make sure there are visible cues throughout the hotel,"" said chief executive Keith Barr. ""We're going to look at the customer journey, including the future of buffets. Will they still exist?"" All that extra friction will increase the likelihood that consumers are put off buying things they do not need. That will be a big problem for all retailers of ""discretionary"" - non-urgent - goods. ""You need to re-convince people of the importance of things they've forgotten about,"" said Roger Parry, chairman of polling company YouGov. ""That third flavour of yoghurt they haven't bought in a while: it's reminding people they get pleasure from unnecessary things.""But hopes of a recovery in spending are set against a troubling backdrop. A rising tide of job losses, such as 18,000 announced at Virgin Atlantic, British Airways and Ryanair in the past fortnight, coupled with stagnant wages, is likely to further depress sentiment. Hours will be cut. Google Trends data shows searches for ""redundancy"" and ""mortgage holiday"" have spiked in recent weeks.Those who have not been furloughed or lost their jobs have become forced or willing savers. Simon French at Panmure Gordon said that during times of unemployment, precautionary savings rise. He calculates there are more than 55.5 million consumers in the UK. Of those, seven million have ""cyclical"" jobs in industries such as manufacturing, whose fortunes rise and fall with the wider economy - and are particularly sensitive to economic sentiment. ""They are the bellwether that will determine whether this is a V-shaped recovery in terms of consumer spending or much more of a U-shaped recovery,"" said French.Swathes of households face financial difficulty, especially as mortgage holidays, the furlough scheme and other payment breaks come to an end next month. Capital Economics estimates that two million mortgage holidays have been granted, while claims for universal credit have rocketed. Debt charity StepChange warned that the self-employed and sole traders, who last struggled during the financial crisis, were also at risk of being dragged into difficulty.All that will heap pressure on ministers and the Bank to do more to stimulate the economy via measures such as VAT cuts, a stamp duty holiday and quantitative easing. Car firms want a scrappage scheme and state-funded discounts to get consumers to buy new, low-emission models. Former Tesco boss Sir Terry Leahy called for regulations to be slashed to free up business investment. ""Take housing,"" Leahy said. ""If you were able to build 300,000 homes rather than 100,000, that greatly increases the supply, houses become more affordable, and those house moves make a big difference in terms of consumer spending.""If there is to be a recovery, it must be supported by clear and reassuring messages about safety from the government, said Belot. Countries such as China and South Korea have been able to lift their lockdowns in part because previous epidemics, such as Sars, meant that they already had systems to handle the crisis.""Everything has to do with reassuring people there are public safety measures in place,"" said Belot. ""What is troubling for people is that they do not really see how the year ahead will go. Uncertainty is very bad for consumption and investment. Some countries are more successful than others when it comes to reassurance about a long-term plan. When I talk to people in Asia, they are a lot less worried, because there are protocols in place to respond to possible new outbreaks.""Here, I am not really sure that people are reassured about the way the crisis has been handled.""",Newspaper

In his speech Mr Johnson also urged the British public to return to work if they are unable to work at home. He said: ""We now need to stress that anyone who can't work from home, for instance those in construction or manufacturing, should be actively encouraged to go to work.""The PM also asked people to avoid public transport if possible and encouraged cycling and walking. Trish Greenhalgh, professor of primary care health sciences at the University of Oxford, said: ""It looks like the PM is trying to implement the 'have cake and eat it' maxim he popularised in a previous life.""On the one hand, he says he's not lifting the lockdown because he is determined to avoid a second peak.""On the other hand, he appears very keen to lift the lockdown because he urgently needs to fix the economy.""Anyone unable to work from home should now return to work from work though they are also advised to avoid public transport, so it's not clear how they will get there.""I can't see what the 'guidance for employers' is going to say, but employers won't be able to generate two metres of distance between employees out of thin air.""The Government has yet to take a positive stance on face coverings, which in addition to continuing hand-washing is probably the one public health measure that could enable us to ease out of lockdown more safely.""Leaving aside who we're allowed to play tennis with from Wednesday, this announcement seems to be pitching at a middle ground that could give us the worst of both worlds.""Deputy chief executive of NHS Providers, Saffron Cordery, said nobody wanted to see restrictions in place for any longer than necessary.""They've helped to protect the NHS and save lives, but they've also caused sacrifice and hardship,"" she said.""So we need a balanced approach, led by the science and clearly communicated so people know what they need to do.""That means easing restrictions when it's safe to do so.""But we must not let down our guard.""For health and care services this will require regular, reliable and easily accessible testing for all staff and patients, backed up by an effective programme of contact tracing, to contain any potential second surge in cases.Cafes and restaurants could start to re-open in July -but there's bad news for pubs""Unfortunately -despite increasing testing capacity -we don't see that detailed and developed approach in place at the moment. We need it now.""Dr Michael Head, senior research fellow in global health at the University of Southampton, said: ""For these revisions to be successful, we need consistent communications from the Government, and the new 'stay alert' messaging is ambiguous and lacks clarity.""We also need the general public to continue to practise social distancing, but there were so many examples of parties and gatherings during the bank holiday weekend, and if that continues that will only serve to increase transmission and delay the country fully reopening.""Professor Dame Til Wykes, from King's College London, said: ""Encouraging people to leave their homes is now going to be difficult with many people having followed the 'stay home' message.""Individuals who are anxious, and many are, will find it tough to respond to the plan and will need some evidence of how safe travelling or work will be.""The communication plan of 'stay alert, control the virus and save lives' -unlike the first step in the plan -is very confused.""We need clear rules and messages that are concise, clear and accurate. This is just short. It is clearly a message written by a communications committee and was never tested in a focus group or with behavioural scientists. A woolly message will hinder, not promote the next phase of this lockdown.""Dr Ron Daniels, an intensive care consultant based in Birmingham, told PA: ""The reality is that the effect of a second wave is just so unknown that it is too risky in most health professionals' view to relax lockdown right now.""We would like to see our capacity in NHS hospitals back down to below usual levels before we can safely do that.""""Do we have enough beds to cope with a second wave if lockdown is relaxed too much Absolutely not. We're still over our usual capacity."" He added: ""The relative impact of any second wave all depends on how many members of our public have already been exposed to this novel coronavirus. Of course, we don't know. ""It may be, as some optimistic estimates suggest, as high as 60-80 per cent of the public who have been exposed. That would mean that a lot of people had had exposure to the virus and not developed symptoms and just gone about their lives as normal.""But the more pessimistic, the more wary estimates, suggest that somewhere under 10 per cent of our population have been exposed.""If that's true, then we expect the second wave -if lockdown is relaxed too quickly and too aggressively -could even be bigger than the first.""Boris Johnson's announcement came as Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland all said they would be sticking to the same ""stay at home"" advice for the public.Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon warned it could be ""catastrophic"" to change the guidance and that the current messaging was ""clear"".On Monday the Government will publish a 50-page document outlining the full plan to cautiously re-start the economy.Nearly seven weeks after the UK entered lockdown, Cabinet minister Robert Jenrick told the BBC: ""The message ... of staying at home now does need to be updated, we need to have a broader message because we want to slowly and cautiously restart the economy and the country.""It comes as the Government failed to meet its own 100,000 tests per day target for the seventh day in a row.",Newspaper; Web Publication

I am classified as ""extremely vulnerable"": over 70, with rheumatoid arthritis, a suppressed immune system, a replacement hip and knees. My quality-adjusted life year (Qaly) score would be low. Yet I still have a life to live.Since my diagnosis and joint replacements, I have hiked in the Andes, tracked snow leopards in Siberia and been wild camping in Sudan. Watching the sun rise over the dunes, I have never felt more alive.Now I am being advised that I can sit by an open window to get some fresh air, and that I must be careful not to fall over when I go out to clap for carers. To continue this for an extended length of time would be the kiss of death. Preserving life at any cost would make that life not worth living.Sue Fleckney Grantham, Lincolnshire Sowing fear The argument that over-70s should be asked to endure prolonged lockdown restrictions to ""protect the NHS"" from having to treat them (News, last week) runs counter to the idea of a health service freely available to all. Has the same idea been considered for the obese? The real problem is that the government has invested next to nothing to prepare for end of lockdown, as its abysmal record on testing shows, and now it thinks it can simply cow the elderly by sowing fear.My generation will not be imprisoned when it has committed no crime. Eric Chalker (81) Hildenborough, Kent Talk to us Our government should realise that its electors of all ages are capable of adult conversation, and consult us on what we might wish for our lives: longer, lonelier and lacking human touch, or perhaps shorter and more satisfying.Annette Lawson, London W9 Patronising views You quote the behavioural scientist Andrew Oswald saying older people ""have no idea of the danger they are in"". I have news for him. We read papers, watch television and have a better perception of living this life than he thinks - and we find his view arrogant and offensive. Colin Little (72¾), Great Missenden, Buckinghamshire Difference a day makes Jen Bouchet (Letters, last week) is disgusted by the over-70s complaining of lockdown. I turned 70 the day her letter was published. What is so special about the ""0""? Why on May 3 did I become such a ""selfish"" risk to NHS staff, when I wasn't on May 2? There is no scientific reason for a healthy, slim, sensible 70-year-old to be considered a greater risk to the NHS than an overweight 55-year old - who attended a rugby match in March, after it was clear that Covid-19 was spreading round the UK, and bragged about shaking hands.

598,"Calls grow for release of restless twentysomethings;Those aged 20-30 are in least physical danger but their mental health and finances are suffering most, researchers say","May 10, 2020 Sunday",International,The Sunday Times (London),865,865,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,Gabriel Pogrund; Shingi Mararike; Shanti Das; Nicholas Hellen,"Calls grow for release of restless twentysomethingsThose aged 20-30 are in least physical danger but their mental health and finances are suffering most, researchers say","@REPNICKTV/@MADDIEDAVIES In a suburb of Stevenage, Hertfordshire, a young man disguised as a bush can be seen on video, shuffling down the street, using front gardens as camouflage to avoid the police. ""What's our neighbour doing?"" says the narrator. ""Reaching new extremes in how to sneak out!"" The clip, which has garnered 3.3 million views on the sharing site TikTok, taps into a welling sentiment among young people: a desire to break the lockdown. They are starting to rebel against restrictions designed to tackle a disease that has left most of them physically unscathed but is damaging their mental wellbeing and life prospects.According to a study by University College London (UCL), they are easily the least compliant age group when it comes to the lockdown: about half of those aged 18-29 admit breaking the rules. The survey of 85,000 found most middle-aged and elderly people complying.This generation gap reflects the reality of the disease: a tiny minority of youngsters who contract the coronavirus die from it. In the first week of May, 10 people in their twenties died of it, compared with 550 in their sixties.Yet the young are faring worse during the lockdown, reporting the strongest feelings of loneliness, anxiety and suicide. UCL found that almost 30% of young people have thought about death recently and that the young had lower life satisfaction than any other age group.Daisy Fancourt, who leads the research, has told Public Health England and the government about the findings: ""We have made them aware of the disproportionate impact that lockdown is having on younger people.""For people in their peak social years lockdown has instilled a collective ""Fomo"" - fear of missing out - and a sense of anxiety and loss about a time they had expected to spend on formative experiences. Added to that is the tyranny that stalks every generation of young people: boredom.As the government announces the next phase of lockdown today, it faces a question: could discontent curdle into mutiny? Andrew Oswald, a behavioural scientist at Warwick University, is among those calling for the state to head off mass non-compliance by introducing a ""staged exit"" from the lockdown in which those in their twenties are released straight away, followed by those in their thirties.""We have to think about the terrible plight of these young people,"" he said. ""[They] should be released almost immediately. It's important to understand they're almost completely safe.""He added that the disproportionate financial effect of Covid-19 on the young made the case for relaxing the rules even more urgent: ""A lot of the old are in a fairly secure position, even if we're all fed up with not being able to go to the beach, but the young ... have very largely run out of all money and their life prospects have suddenly worsened dramatically.""Young people have the lowest confidence in the government of any group. According to the study, their trust in Boris Johnson has risen under the lockdown, but less than in other age groups.Dylan Welsh, 22, a student at Strathclyde University in Glasgow, has been self-isolating in his flat for eight weeks. He reported seeing people on Instagram flouting the lockdown: ""It infuriates me, but I'm in an awkward position to be, like: are you properly social distancing?""

""It's very frustrating,"" she said.Meanwhile, the authorities have clamped down on house parties, barbecues in parks and large gatherings. In Stockton, Co Durham, last week police secured a closure order for a flat that held a lockdown party featuring a ""constant flow of visitors by car, taxi, bicycle, moped and on foot"".On the Wirral, the council has drawn up a list of hotspots where young people are gathering illicitly. Last week it said that its detached youth team - an arm of social services - had been redeployed to round up errant teenagers and ""educate them"" on social distancing.Yesterday people flocked to London's parks and public spaces to enjoy the sunshine, with many flouting social distancing rules. Hackney Marshes was crammed with young people swimming in the River Lea. Police wrote on social media: ""We're fighting a losing battle in the parks today.

599,"Public put at risk by the spread of confusion;With Holyrood and Westminster split over lockdown, it's hard to know who we should listen to","May 10, 2020 Sunday",International,thetimes.co.uk,874,874,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,Magnus Linklater,"Public put at risk by the spread of confusionWith Holyrood and Westminster split over lockdown, it's hard to know who we should listen to","It has been a good lambing season. Warm weather, grass coming through strongly, little sign of the many diseases newborn lambs are prone to. I spent an evening with our local shepherd last week, watching him rounding up lost lambs and returning them to their mothers.It is a remarkable skill. To most of us one sheep looks much like another. Identifying the one ewe out of an entire flock which has become separated from its offspring, unsteady on its feet and bleating anxiously, is like finding a needle in a haystack. Rounding it up and staging a reunion is a lengthy task but immensely rewarding, as mother and child race towards each other.There has been one unintended consequence of the lockdown. Along two of the lambing fields close to the River Tay runs a public road, and local residents who once went to work during the week now use it to walk their dogs.If there is one thing that spooks sheep it is bounding dogs - they see them, presumably, as a throwback to wolves, and they scatter, losing their lambs in the process. It is known in the trade as ""mis-mothering"", and it takes hours to repair.The walkers fall into two schools: those who are deeply apologetic and promise to keep their dogs well away so long as lambing continues; and those who assert their rights. This, they say, is a public right of way, and this their permitted period of time out in the open.This collision of attitudes goes wider than the sheep flocks of Perthshire. It runs through the population as a whole, and it will determine whether Boris Johnson's announcement yesterday that the rules which have so far kept us indoors are to be relaxed will be accepted or exploited. Already there are signs that people are beginning to push the boundaries, gathering in groups, sunbathing in the parks, swimming in rivers and ponds, regardless of social distancing.The young, in particular, are turning mutinous after six weeks of lockdown. They believe they have suffered more than most because they have lost jobs or an early start to their careers; many of them face serious financial hardship; others are simply going stir crazy. They are also least susceptible to the disease. Some experts believe they should be the first to be allowed out.Andrew Oswald, a behavioural scientist at Warwick University, argues that people in their twenties and then thirties should be released almost immediately. ""It's important to understand they're almost completely safe,"" he suggests. Mr Johnson rejects that approach, but he does want to offer them some hope of greater freedom. In Scotland, Nicola Sturgeon remains cautious.Which voice, then, do the people heed? The advice of a government that is relaxing the rules on outdoor exercise, on the workplace and on industries like construction; or the continuing rigidity north of the border? That depends ultimately on the character of the nation today, and its attitude to those in charge. Much has changed since that period, 75 years ago, when the war ended, and the people emerged from their long privation to celebrate freedom. I was struck by the image of the lights coming on again after the blackout, with curtains ripped open and searchlights playing on public buildings. Then there had been six years of absolute obedience in the face of a visible threat. Today the enemy is largely invisible and, after only six weeks, the rules are getting harder to enforce.In her speech last Friday night the Queen suggested that the character of the British people had not changed much since the war. ""When I look at our country today and see what we are willing to do to protect and support one another, I say with pride that we are still a nation those brave soldiers, sailors and airmen would recognise and admire,"" she said. She may be right, but of course the nation she was recalling did not always play by the rules of the game. Within a few short months of those mass celebrations on the streets of Britain's cities, they would turn against the leader who had brought them victory and vote in a socialist government.Mr Johnson may face the same scepticism. He seeks to persuade the people that they should obey a new set of rules that are not necessarily agreed by all countries and regions in the UK. He is doing so against mounting impatience, with business leaders urging a relaunch of the economy, small companies desperate to avoid closure, and a people whose obedience cannot necessarily be counted on. Like the dog-walkers, they have their rights, and those rights may be asserted.There is a wonderful sketch by our national treasure, Stanley Baxter (94 this month), in which he plays the Queen on a royal tour of Belfast. She meets a lady in the crowd (played of course by Baxter) who, when asked ""have you come far?"" proceeds to harangue her at length, to the Queen's mounting dismay. I suspect that Mr Johnson may encounter something similar as he seeks to rally the nation behind a continued, if slightly different, lockdown.His new message seeks to strike a delicate balance between restrictions that are being increasingly flouted, and the need to control a dangerous and highly infectious virus. Whether the citizens of the UK are in a mood to listen will determine the future course of the epidemic.",Newspaper; Web Publication
600,Sage having 'heated arguments' over science of lockdown;The use of face masks and the easing of lockdown measures have been the subject of debate,"May 10, 2020 Sunday",International,telegraph.co.uk,490,490,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,By Bill Gardner,Sage having 'heated arguments' over science of lockdownThe use of face masks and the easing of lockdown measures have been the subject of debate,"The Sage committee of scientists advising the government has been split by ""heated arguments"" over how the UK should leave lockdown, a senior member has revealed.Professor Peter Horby said key experts had been deeply divided over the scientific evidence guiding the UK's coronavirus response, amid a lack of reliable data.Scientists on the committee are understood to have argued fiercely about the use of face masks, the likelihood of immunity, and the rate at which lockdown measures should be eased.Prof Horby, chairman of the UK Government's New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group (Nervtag), said ""imperfect"" statistics had made the task of guiding government more difficult.He said scientists needed more reliable data, especially around the so-called 'R value' which measures the spread of Covid-19 across the country.""There's very robust discussions at those meetings and there are frequently quite heated arguments,"" Prof Horby told the BBC.Asked whether the R rate was ""at best, a guess"", he replied: ""It's an estimate. It's based on all sorts of data sources, all of which are imperfect, and you try and put them all together to get the best idea.""What we need to focus on is improving the data streams. We need to get data much quicker on the number of people infected in the community. That will allow us to have a much more precise idea of what's happening and that we can calibrate the public health response so that we can keep it under control.""A number of scientists on the Sage committee believe that the slow rollout of mass testing has left the UK unable to effectively monitor the spread of Covid-19, it is understood.Sir Patrick Vallance, the chief scientific advisor, said last month of Sage discussions: ""The weaker the evidence and the more controversial it is the more heated and prolonged the discussions are, and the more opinion becomes the dominant feature.""Meanwhile a censorship row between scientific advisors and the government prompted a major U-turn.Scientists had accused ministers of ""Stalinist"" behaviour after key advice guiding the coronavirus response was redacted from a report released to the public.One member of the government's SPI-B advisory committee, Stephen Reicher, a professor of social psychology at the University of St Andrews, wrote on social media: ""The greatest asset we have in this crisis is the trust and adherence of the public. You want trust? You need to be open with people. This isn't open. It is reminiscent of Stalinist Russia. Not a good look.""Yesterday the documents were released in full, revealing that some experts had advised the government not to impose heavy fines on people who broke lockdown rules.A government spokesperson said: ""Sir Patrick Vallance and No10 agree that such Sage documents relating to Covid should be published in full, in the interests of maximum transparency, with exceptions only for matters relating to national security.""",Newspaper; Web Publication

Amid concern that the latest slogan and what is meant by ""Stay Alert"" would cause confusion among the public No 10 were forced to issue a lengthy clarificationto the message.A No 10 spokesman said the public could stay alert by ""staying at home as much as possible"", ""limiting contact with other people"" and keeping two metres apart where possible.""We can control the virus by keeping the rate of infection (R) and the number of infections down,"" the spokesman said.This afternoon Boris Johnson tweeted an image of thenew slogan which included ways to stay alert. The image, which had the headline ""we can help control the virus if we all Stay Alert"", listed staying at home ""as much as possible,"" as well as working from home ""if you can"" and a call to ""limit contact with other people"" as ways to stay alert. It also instructed the public to ""keep your distance if you go out"" and ""wash your hands regularly"". Mr Johnson accompanied the image by saying: ""Everyone has a role to play in helping to control the virus by staying alert and following the rules.""This is how we can continue to save lives as we start to recover from coronavirus.""

Ms Sturgeon later said the ""stay alert"" message was ""vague and imprecise"", compared to the previous message which was ""clear"".She asked that the new campaign was not deployed north of the border as she said it would be ""catastrophic"" to drop the ""stay at home"" advice. During this afternoon's Cobra meeting it is understood Ms Sturgeon accused Michael Gove of not giving the devolved nations the whole picture as she said the first she heard of ""the PM's new slogan"" was in newspaper reports.Mark Drakeford, Wales' First Minister, seconded Ms Sturgeon's response as he said ""staying at home remains the best way you can protect yourself and others,"" as he cautioned against ""fundamentally different rules because that is confusing for people and it makes the basic message harder to convey"". Northern Ireland's First Minister, Arlene Foster, also urged the region to stick with the ""stay home, save lives"" message.""On the whole, the message is to stay at home. We will say we are not deviating from the message at this time,"" she told BBC Northern Ireland radio. Jeane Freeman, the Scottish Health Secretary, added that the new slogan was ""not a change that we would agree with"". ""I think the First Minister was really clear last week that the 'stay at home' message was the right message and if I'm perfectly frank, I have no idea what 'stay alert' actually means,"" she told BBC's Politics Scotland.Ms Freeman said the population would be ""at a disadvantage"" when adhering to the guidance if communications from the Government were not clear.""We're asking the public to do a very great deal here and the least we can do is be consistent and clear in the message that we're sending and 'stay at home' is the right message,"" she said. Behavioural expert Professor Susan Michie, who is a member of the scientific advisory group for emergencies (Sage), said Mr Johnson's new messaging is ""a long way"" from being clear and consistent.""Dropping the 'stay at home' message from the main slogan in favour of generalised alertness may be taken as a green light by many to not stay at home and begin socialising with friends and other activities that increase the risk of transmission,"" she said. ""This could potentially undermine the good work over the last few weeks that has seen impressively sustained high levels of adherence by the public in what for many are very challenging situations.""However Robert Jenrick, the Communities Secretary, defended the ""broader"" slogan which he said was needed for the Government to restart the economy.""I think that's what the public want and that they will be able to understand this message, which is that we should be staying home as much as possible but when we do go to work and go about our business we need to remain vigilant, we need to stay alert,"" he told Sky's Sophy Ridge on Sunday. He later insisted that the Government was not ""going to take risks with the public"" but said ""we want now to have a message which encourages people to go to work"".Meanwhile Jonathan Ashworth, the shadow health secretary, urged the Prime Minister to provide ""clarity"" over what the new slogan means. ""There is no room for nuance in this, this virus exploits ambivalence, it thrives on ambiguity,"" he said.Mr Ashworth warned that people would be ""slightly puzzled, questioning what does it mean to stay alert, what are the government saying with that?"" ""I think the stay at home message is easily understood and that is the strength and beauty of that message,"" he said. It comes after large numbers of people were seen enjoying parks on Bank Holiday Friday, including a rise in road traffic and an increase in Coastguard call-outs, causing mounting concern people continue to flout the clear ""stay at home"" advice. Ed Davey, the acting leader of the Lib Dems, said by dropping the 'Stay at Home' slogan the Government had made the job of the police ""near impossible"". ""Ministers risk sowing confusion and losing public trust with this muddled communications strategy and lack of transparency,"" he said, as he called on ministers to publish the ""evidence they are relying on to make these decisions"".

It includes tests that were posted out. We're told 31,587 people have died. No they haven't. It's far more than that."" The professor, also chair of the Winton Centre for Risk and Evidence Communication at the University of Cambridge, continued: ""I think this is not a trustworthy communication of statistics. It's such a missed opportunity. There's a public out there who are broadly very supportive of the measures, they're hungry for details, for facts, for genuine information.""And yet they get fed this, what I call number theatre, which seems to be coordinated really much more by No 10's communications team, rather than genuinely trying to inform people about what's going on.""He added: ""I just wish the data was being brought together and presented by people who really knew its strength and limitations and could treat the audience with some respect.""When asked by Marr later on the programme whether, in response to the criticism, the government would rethink the way they present the numbers, communities secretary Robert Jenrick said: ""Well, I'm sure there's ways we can improve these press conferences. ""They continue to get large audiences, but they're designed to inform the public. If there are better ways of presenting the numbers - and I very strongly respect the professor - if we can do that, we should and will do that.""Ministers have cited the views of Professor Spiegelhalter a number of times during the pandemic. When questioned about the death toll by Labour leader Keir Starmer during prime minister's questions on Wednesday last week, Boris Johnson said: ""I would echo what we've heard from Professor David Spiegelhalter and others: that at this stage, I don't think that international comparisons and the data is yet there to draw all the conclusions that we want.""The message the government is putting out to the public on the pandemic has also been criticised by another member of Sage, behavioural expert Professor Susan Michie who said dropping the ""stay home"" slogan risked giving people the green light to socialise, jeopardising the gains made by the coronavirus lockdown in.Prof Michie said Mr Johnson's new messaging was ""a long way"" from being clear and consistent, adding: ""This could potentially undermine the good work over the last few weeks that has seen impressively sustained high levels of adherence by the public in what for many are very challenging situations.""It comes as the prime minister is expected to unveil a new colour-coded alert system as he eases some lockdown restrictions in Sunday night's daily briefing.

For updates on coronavirus, follow our live blog                                         Labour leader Keir Starmer said: ""This statement raises more questions than it answers, and we see the prospect of England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland pulling in different directions.""The Prime Minister appears to be effectively telling millions of people to go back to work without a clear plan for safety or guidance as to how to get there without using public transport.""What the country wanted tonight was clarity and consensus, but we haven't got either of those.""The announcement came as the official number of deaths in the UK rose by 269 to 31,855.The leaders of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland rejected the new ""stay alert"" advice, saying they were not consulted and would be making only minor tweaks instead.After a COBRA meeting with the PM, Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon warned that the ""vague and imprecise"" slogan could have ""catastrophic"" consequences.Behavioural expert Professor Susan Michie, of the SAGE group of scientists, said the new slogan was ""a long way from"" being clear and consistent.She added: ""[It] may be taken as a green light by many to not stay at home, and begin socialising with friends and other activities that increase the risk of transmission.""In his televised address last night, Mr Johnson announced a ""change in emphasis"" - rather than strictly a change in the rules - for who should and shouldn't be at work.He said: ""Anyone who can't work from home, for instance those in construction or manufacturing, should be actively encouraged to go to work.""Work from home if you can, but you should go to work if you can't work from home.""He said the Government is establishing guidance for firms to make workplaces safe. But he did not say when it would be published.There were glaring omissions in the PM's statement, including any details on when the public would be able to see family and friends again.Nor was there any specific updated advice for the over-70s or the 1.5 million people shielding because they have underlying health conditions.Many of them fear the Government is considering ""cocooning"" them for months while the rest of the country gets back to normal.In his pre-recorded speech, Mr Johnson outlined his ""roadmap"" to a new normality, with a five-stage warning system to track the outbreak.The PM said social distancing rules of staying two metres apart remain in place and if people don't obey them they face increased fines up to £3,200.The Government will today publish a 50-page document outlining the full details of the plan to restart the economy.The next step, as reported by the Mirror last week, will be pupils returning to primary school after half-term at the earliest, beginning with reception, Year 1 and Year 6. Nurseries could also return. There may then be a phased reopening of non-essential shops.Following that, ministers are hoping that the pupils sitting GCSEs and A-levels could also return to school before the summer holidays.Cafes in parks and restaurants with outdoor space - but not pubs - could reopen from July at the earliest.Places of worship, cinemas, as well as other public places, could also reopen. Mr Johnson said: ""If there are outbreaks, if there are problems, we will not hesitate to put on the brakes.""We have been through the initial peak. But it's coming down the mountain that is often more dangerous.""If we can't do it by those dates, and if the alert level won't allow it, we will wait and go on until we've got it right.""He gave the impression last week that lockdown would start to be lifted from today.He then came under pressure to maintain it until June at least after he was warned outbreaks in care homes and hospitals made significant easing any sooner too dangerous.Amid the confusion over lifting the measures, the public visited parks and beaches over the Bank Holiday weekend, as well as holding street parties to celebrate VE Day on Friday.Scientific advisers to the Government had warned that the UK could still suffer more than 100,000 deaths by the end of the year if measures are hastily relaxed.An unnamed government adviser said: ""There is very limited room for manoeuvre.""Figures suggest the UK death toll may be 36,800, around 5,000 higher than the official number.",Newspaper; Web Publication
